<summary>Description</summary>

> Quick, clever, and always on the move—meet the Eurasian red squirrel, a leafy treetop resident found across much of Europe and Asia. While it prefers the shelter of forests, this agile creature easily adapts to gardens and parks. It builds its nest, called a drey, high in the fork of a tree using twigs to form a domed structure about 10 to 12 inches wide. The female featured here is gathering moss—one of several soft materials, along with bark, leaves, and grass, that line the nest and turn it into a snug, well-insulated retreat. These rodents may also take over tree hollows or abandoned woodpecker holes when available.
> 
> Typically solitary and quite shy, they rarely share food or space. However, during colder months, it's not uncommon for several individuals to use the same nest to stay warm. Their social organization is shaped by dominance hierarchies, both within and between the sexes. While males aren't always dominant over females, the top-ranking individuals tend to be older and larger. Dominant males also tend to occupy larger home ranges than subordinate males or most females.

> Read it and believe it—literacy changes everything. As a basic human right, literacy is a powerful tool that opens the door to greater freedoms and active global citizenship. Recognizing its far-reaching impact, International Literacy Day—observed each year on September 8 since 1967—serves as a reminder of how vital literacy is in building a better, more sustainable future for all. This year, the theme explores literacy in a digital age, where technology continues to reshape how people learn, communicate, and participate in society. As a result, digital engagement has become both a challenge and an opportunity.
> 
> Bringing this vision to life in a youth-centric urban setting, library@orchard at Orchard Gateway in Singapore, featured here, reflects a bold shift in how libraries engage with younger audiences. Spanning two visually distinct levels—The Studio and The Loft—this 18,000-square-foot space holds a curated collection of 100,000 items. Developed in collaboration with students and lecturers from Singapore Polytechnic, this library is a dynamic environment for learning, expression, and creative exploration in the heart of Orchard Road.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Where cobbled charm meets coastal cool, Gdańsk is a dynamic city in Poland's Pomorskie province. It is part of Tricity—a metropolitan area along the Gdańsk Bay that includes the neighboring coastal cities of Sopot and Gdynia, along with nearby towns. The city likely takes its name from 'Gdania,' an earlier name for the Motława river that runs through it.
> 
> The city originated as a Slavic fort in the late 10th century and was first recorded in 997, when it came under the early influence of the Polish state. Over the centuries, Gdańsk has experienced Polish, German, and independent rule, each leaving a mark on the region's identity. The Main City draws most visitors, especially to the lively promenade that runs along Ulica Długa (Long Street) and Długi Targ (Long Market). Flanked by decorative gates and lined with stately townhouses rebuilt in 17th-century style, this pedestrian stretch is steeped in charm. Once the ceremonial path for Polish royalty, it's now fondly known as the Royal Route. The path unfolds like a living museum, dotted with historic landmarks like the Highland Gate, Amber Museum, Uphagen's House, Main Town Hall, Neptune's Fountain, and the grand Artus Court.

> They fly backward, dive-bomb rivals, and travel farther than most road trippers. On National Hummingbird Day, meet the rufous hummingbird—photographed in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, California. The bird, one of nine species in the genus Selasphorus, gets its name from its rusty, reddish-orange feathers. Males flash copper backs and red throat patches that shimmer in the sun. Females are more subdued but still carry streaks of rufous on their sides and tails.
> 
> They may look sweet, but these pollinators are known for their aggressive behavior, often chasing away not just other hummingbirds, but also bees and butterflies. At around 3 inches long, this nectar-seeker is a frequent flyer in the most literal sense. Each year, it migrates from Mexico to Alaska and back—a round-trip of up to 8,000 miles. That's one of the longest migrations relative to body size in the bird world. And here's the kicker: many return to the exact same gardens and feeders year after year.
> 
> Whether you're planting flowers, or peering through binoculars as one zips by, National Hummingbird Day is a good excuse to slow down and marvel at something tiny but mighty.

> When the sun clocks out in streaks of orange, pink, and purple, Santa Monica goes from laid-back to lit up. Literally. With over 3 miles of sand, a historic pier, and the Pacific Coast Highway keeping things scenic, this beach is more than just a pretty shoreline. Let's start with the sand. Wide, clean, and ready for volleyball or just flopping down with a good book, it's ideal for sunbathers and sandcastle architects alike. And yes, 'Baywatch' was filmed along Santa Monica Bay. Feel free to run in slow motion.
> 
> Then there's the Santa Monica Pier. Built in 1909 and still standing tall on wooden legs, it's got an amusement park called Pacific Park, arcade, restaurants, and that famous solar-powered Ferris wheel. Up for more movement? The Marvin Braude Bike Trail, or the Strand, is a 22-mile bike path that zips right through the beach. Rent a cruiser and ride past rollerbladers, dog walkers, and tourists trying to juggle ice cream and selfies. Here, the surf is another draw. Beginners can catch their first wave here, while pros keep an eye on the swells farther out.

> It's time to go wild—responsibly! Today is National Wildlife Day. Let's celebrate the incredible animals that roam, fly, swim, and slither across our planet. It's also a day to honor the work of wildlife sanctuaries, conservationists, and endangered species programs that protect our most vulnerable creatures.
> 
> Among the most iconic of these is the grizzly bear, a symbol of the American wilderness. Young grizzlies like these cubs in Alaska's Katmai National Park often 'play-fight' to build strength, sharpen skills, and establish social bonds. These heavyweight champs can weigh up to 900 pounds and still sprint faster than most humans (up to 35 mph). Once widespread across the western United States, grizzlies now primarily roam Alaska and parts of the Northern Rockies. National Wildlife Day reminds us that keeping their wild spaces safe is key to their survival—and ours. So today, let's honor the wild, protect what's precious, and maybe growl a little in solidarity.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The Wilderness Act of 1964, passed 61 years ago today, established the legal definition of wilderness in the United States. Its purpose was to preserve areas 'where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man.' This landmark legislation created the National Wilderness Preservation System, protecting millions of acres from development, roads, and mechanized use.
> 
> Among the most iconic areas protected under this act is the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in northeastern Minnesota. Spanning over one million acres, it is a vast expanse of interconnected lakes, rivers, and boreal forests. The landscape is a mosaic of glacially carved waterways, rocky outcrops, and dense woodlands, offering a haven for moose, wolves, loons, and countless other species. With over 1,200 miles of canoe routes and more than 2,000 campsites, it provides a rare opportunity for solitude and immersion in nature. The Wilderness Act laid the foundation for safeguarding places like the Boundary Waters, ensuring they remain wild and untouched for future generations to experience and cherish.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
