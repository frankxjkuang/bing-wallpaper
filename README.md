<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> The enchanting Isle of Skye in Scotland is home to the Sligachan Old Bridge, built by Thomas Telford, a prolific Scottish civil engineer, in the early 1800s. The bridge arches over a river of the same name, and carries only cyclists and pedestrians, while a modern bridge downstream serves cars. From atop the bridge's weathered, mossy stones, travelers can take in the majestic Cuillin Mountains in the distance. According to local tradition, the Sligachan River's water contains a mysterious blessing provided by fairies. Those who dare to immerse their faces in these waters are said to be gifted with timeless beauty.

> This autumnal scene can be found on the grounds of Schönbrunn Palace, in the Austrian capital, Vienna. It was the summer residence of the ruling Habsburg emperors from the 18th century to 1918, having been redeveloped by Empress Maria Theresa in the 1740s. Complemented by its lush gardens, which house the world's oldest existing public zoo, the palace itself is a gem of Europe's opulent Baroque era. Schönbrunn Palace Park has been open to the public since 1779 and both it and the palace, now under the ownership of the Austrian government, are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This leaf-strewn path offers an escape from the bustling city. So, take a stroll on this enchanting estate and let yourself be transported to centuries past.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument is an untamed wilderness of cliffs and canyons in the heart of southern Utah. The Grand Staircase is a sequence of five majestic sandstone cliffs, rising approximately 5,500 feet across the expanse of the monument. Each step records a different era in Earth's geological history, a vast showcase of changes over 200 million years. Archaeologists have found prehistoric artifacts, petrified wood, and dinosaur fossils which are over 75 million years old. In human history, the Ancestral Puebloan and Fremont people mastered the art of farming in this challenging terrain. They constructed granaries to store and preserve their harvests. Today, it is a popular getaway for nature enthusiasts and travelers seeking adventure.

> Hungary is a country blessed with stunning landscapes and a host of historic castles. From the opulent Buda Castle in Budapest, with its commanding views of the Danube, to Eger Castle, renowned for its heroic defense against the Turks, each site has a story to tell.
> 
> Our homepage image shows one such stronghold, Füzér Castle, which crowns the Zemplén Mountains near Hungary's northern border and dates back to the 13th century. Perched at an elevation of over 1,800 feet above sea level, this castle stands on a mountain of volcanic origin. Here, within its ancient stone walls, the crown of Hungary was hidden following the country's defeat by the Ottoman Empire in the 1526 Battle of Mohács. After years of ruin, the castle's chapel was restored in 2016, and the keep was rebuilt to its former glory.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Imagine traveling for nearly two years across plains, mountains, and forests and finally arriving at this setting, where the mighty Columbia River empties into the Pacific near present-day Astoria, Oregon. That is the sight that greeted explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark in 1805 at the halfway point of their legendary 8,000-mile North American expedition that originated near St. Louis.
> 
> The expedition's success opened the way for further exploration and development of the Pacific Northwest and by 1811, Fort Astoria, the first US-owned settlement on the West Coast, was established. Oregon became the 33rd state in 1859. The Astoria-Megler Bridge opened in 1966, the final piece connecting Los Angeles to Olympia, Washington, via US Route 101.
> 
> Water from seven states and two Canadian provinces flows through the Columbia, passing under the 4-mile structure, the longest continuous truss bridge in North America.
