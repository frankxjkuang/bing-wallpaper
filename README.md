<summary>Description</summary>

> The first Arbor Day in the US was held in 1872. Since then, the event has really taken root. On the last Friday of April, people across the country mark the occasion by planting trees, often dedicating them to a loved one. It's also a great day to celebrate trees themselves. As well as providing homes for countless species of animals, trees absorb carbon dioxide and clean the air we breathe. They also help to keep cities cooler and can even play a role in preventing floods.
> 
> The amazing tree in today's image is the Tree of Life at Kalaloch Beach on Washington's Pacific coast. Seemingly defying gravity, this large Sitka spruce's roots cling to the sides of a small gully. The soil under the tree is slowly being worn away by a stream that flows into the Pacific Ocean, yet, somehow, the Tree of Life continues to grow. Given its will to live, it's easy to understand how this tree earned its nickname.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Why fly when you can slide? Happy World Penguin Day! There are 18 species of these flightless birds, 17 of which live in the Southern Hemisphere. Today's Antarctic image stars Adélie penguins, discovered in 1840 by French adventurer Jules Dumont d'Urville, who named them after his wife, Adèle. Despite their small size, Adélie penguins are sleek swimmers and can dive as deep as 575 feet in search of shrimp-like krill or fish. They are social animals that gather in small colonies for foraging, hunting, and protection. While it may seem mischievous, Adélies steal pebbles from nearby nests to strengthen their own, safeguarding their eggs and chicks from Antarctica's harsh conditions and predators.

> Three petals, three leaves, and three stigmas—that's the white trillium for you, whose name derived from the Latin word for 'three.' Native to eastern North America, the spring-blooming species is one of the most common woodland wildflowers. Unlike some impulsive blossoms that burst into color at the slightest hint of warmth, this plant is a slow bloomer. From gracing US postage stamps to being the state wildflower of Ohio and an official symbol of Canada's Ontario, the white trillium is ingrained in our culture. Beyond its aesthetic appeal, the plant has earned its stripes in the world of herbal medicine. So, next time you find yourself wandering through the woodland realm, keep an eye out for this floral gem!

> In the heart of Ireland, amidst the storied halls of the Library of Trinity College Dublin, scrolls and tomes whisper tales of long-gone eras. Today, these silent storytellers shine for World Book Day. Established by UNESCO in 1995, the day serves as a reminder of the importance of reading, publishing, and copyright. But why April 23? It marks the shared death anniversary of William Shakespeare, Miguel de Cervantes, and several other literary greats. From the annual street festival exhibiting authors, poets, and literary organizations in Kensington, Maryland, to the distribution of book vouchers to kids in many countries around the world, this day comes alive with the rustle of turning pages. Interestingly, each year, UNESCO crowns one city as the 'World Book Capital.' The chosen city then carries out activities aimed at promoting reading for the awarded year; this year it is Strasbourg, France. So, have you picked out a book to read yet?

> Today is Earth Day—a day dedicated to celebrating the planet we call home and raising awareness of environmental problems. The seeds of this day were planted back in 1969 when Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin witnessed events like the Cuyahoga River catching fire and the Santa Barbara oil spill and decided that the world needed an environmental initiative. A year later, the first Earth Day event was held. Now, it has grown into an annual event with more than a billion people in over 193 countries taking part.
> 
> This year, the campaign's focus is on plastics, which are a particularly serious form of pollution on land and in the oceans. Many species—including this green sea turtle—eat plastic waste, mistaking it for food. Plastics also pose an entanglement risk and can also break down to become microplastics. Every year, 25 million tons of plastic enter aquatic ecosystems. So, whether you're planting trees, cleaning up beaches, or simply spreading the word, let's remember to promote sustainable living. After all, there's no planet B!

> As National Park Week unfurls its green banners, let's take a stroll down Sparks Lane, in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee. Established in 1934, the park encompasses over 522,419 acres of wilderness, mostly covered with forests. It is home to 1,500 species of flowering plants, 952 algae, 65 species of mammals, and over 240 species of birds, making it an International Biosphere Reserve.

Across the country, America's most stunning landscapes throw their gates wide open, inviting everyone to embrace the great outdoors for free. Throughout the celebration, various programs will be organized by the National Park Service, including ranger-led tours, volunteer opportunities, and educational workshops.

Grant, the park is known for its flora, fauna—including Rocky Mountain wolves, and grizzly and black bears—supervolcano, and many geothermal features, including the one we see in today's image. The Grand Prismatic Spring is in the Midway Geyser Basin. Its display of colors is caused by multi-layered sheets of microorganisms, ranging from deep blues and greens to fiery oranges and reds. There is so much waiting to be explored out there, so gather your friends and get out into the wild.
