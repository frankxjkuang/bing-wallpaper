<summary>Description</summary>

> For Father's Day, we're featuring a male lesser rhea (aka Darwin's rhea) with his chicks in Torres del Paine National Park, Patagonia, Chile. From the moment the chicks hatch, the male lesser rhea takes full charge—guiding them through the brush, communicating with gentle whistles, and sheltering them under his wings in times of danger or cold. Remarkably, he often adopts lost chicks, raising a mixed-age brood. For nearly 6 months, this bird father teaches and protects the chicks, with many staying close until maturity. Talk about going above and beyond for your kids!

> Every June 14, we celebrate national pride and the fabric that unites us—the American flag. It was only when Congress passed the Flag Resolution on June 14, 1777, that the Stars and Stripes design was adopted as the official flag of the United States. To commemorate this historic milestone, then-president Woodrow Wilson proclaimed June 14 as Flag Day in 1916—a tribute to the banner that came to represent America's identity, values, and unity.
> 
> The current 50-star design wasn't created by a professional, but by Robert Heft, a high school student in Lancaster, Ohio. He came up with the design for a high school history project where students had to update the national flag to recognize the new states of Alaska and Hawaii. Heft only got a B-minus on his creation. But after it was sent off to Washington, DC, and selected by President Eisenhower as the new national flag in 1959, he got that grade up to an A.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Not far from São Miguel Island in the Azores archipelago of Portugal, you'll find Vila Franca Islet. This uninhabited green islet sits quietly just south of the town of Vila Franca do Campo. Beneath its serene surface, this gem holds a lively past. First documented in 1537, around the time when settlers from São Miguel began expanding westward, Vila Franca Islet has played many roles throughout its history. It has served as a military fort, a port, a vineyard site, and even a lookout for whale-watching.
> 
> Once a volcanic crater, this islet is now a protected nature reserve teeming with unique marine life, including bird species like Bulwer's petrel, little egret, and sooty tern. The unique shape of this tiny island, sculpted by nature, makes it truly special. At its heart lies an almost perfectly circular lagoon, linked to the sea by a narrow channel called Boquete. Since the opening faces north toward São Miguel, it shields the lagoon from ocean waves and forms a calm natural harbor with a sandy beach. It's no wonder the spot is a favorite for swimmers: from June to October, ferries run daily between the town and the islet. Access is limited to 400 visitors a day—do you want to be one of them?

<summary>Description</summary>

> They say everything's bigger in Texas—and Big Bend National Park has been living up to the slogan since forever. Efforts to preserve this 801,163-acre area of West Texas began in the 1930s and culminated in its official designation as a park on June 12, 1944. Big Bend remains one of the most remote and least-visited national parks in the country. It's not just one landscape, it's three: the Chihuahuan Desert, the Chisos Mountains (pictured here), and the Rio Grande. Big Bend sits on the US–Mexico border, and its history reflects that blend. Indigenous peoples, Spanish explorers, ranchers, miners, and modern travelers have all left their footprints. Petroglyphs, ruins, and old trails show the land's story began long before it became a park.
> 
> The park is home to over 1,200 species of plants, more than 450 species of birds, and a wide variety of mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. You might spot a roadrunner zipping across the dirt, or a bobcat silently slipping through the underbrush. Additionally, it has been designated as one of the best dark-sky parks in America, offering views of the Milky Way, planets, and constellations.

> In Lüderitz, Namibia, these birds aren't just passing through—they're standing their ground. Literally. On one leg. These long-legged locals, the greater flamingos, bring a splash of pink to Namibia's windswept Atlantic coast. These birds are the largest of their kind, and they're not shy about showing off. Towering up to 59 inches tall with spoon-shaped bills and stilt-like legs, they're easy to spot.
> 
> That bubblegum pink hue? That's all diet. Flamingos feed on algae, crustaceans, and tiny invertebrates packed with carotenoids—the same pigments that make carrots orange. The more they eat, the pinker they get. In other words, they're what they eat, right down to the blush. In the air, flamingos are sleek flyers, cruising long distances in a V-formation. Their migration habits are still being studied, but it's clear they go where the wetlands flow—from inland salt pans to coastal sanctuaries, always in search of food and safe nesting zones.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Wouldn't it be great to see our reflection from above in this vast expanse of water? Everglades National Park, located in Florida, is the largest tropical wilderness in the United States, spanning more than 1.5 million acres. It protects the southern 20% of the original Everglades and is home to numerous rare and endangered species, including the Florida panther, American crocodile, and West Indian manatee. Often referred to as 'River of Grass,' the park's unique ecosystem, fed by a slow-moving river from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay, is a significant breeding ground for tropical wading birds. Everglades National Park is not only a national treasure but also an international one, recognized as a World Heritage Site, an International Biosphere Reserve, and a Wetland of International Importance.
> 
> The park also plays a crucial role in water conservation and flood control, as its wetlands serve as natural filters and buffers against storms. Efforts to preserve and restore the Everglades are ongoing, with numerous initiatives aimed at combating invasive species, improving water quality, and protecting wildlife habitats.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> There is something mesmerizing about cities that wear their history on their sleeves—and Dubrovnik, Croatia, is one of them. Once known as the independent Republic of Ragusa, this city was a major maritime power and trading hub from the 14th to the 19th century. Situated in southern Dalmatia along the Adriatic Sea, its success was built on diplomacy and seafaring. The Walls of Dubrovnik, built between the 13th and 17th centuries, stretch for over 1.2 miles, with towers, forts, and bastions still standing strong. The current layout of the walls follows a city plan from 1292, when Dubrovnik was rebuilt after a fire under Venetian rule.
> 
> Inside these walls is the Old City—a compact grid of polished limestone streets, baroque churches, and centuries-old residences. Everything here, including the 15th-century Rector's Palace, Sponza Palace, and the Church of St. Blaise, reflects the city's independent past. The Franciscan Monastery, Europe's oldest still operating pharmacy, adds another layer of charm to this vintage place. Dubrovnik might seem familiar. That's because it has represented the cities of King's Landing and Qarth in 'Game of Thrones,' putting it on the pop culture map. It's not just a touristy location—it's a city that has been writing its own script for over a thousand years.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
