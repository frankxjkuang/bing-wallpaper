> When temperatures plunge, the American bison couldn't care less. These burly mammals are ready for snow with their shaggy coats and massive bodies weighing up to 2,000 pounds. Our homepage bison are pictured in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, home to one of the largest and oldest herds in the country. Bison have roamed here since prehistoric times.

> Wildlife conservationists, Native American tribes, and ranchers have campaigned to establish National Bison Day a federally recognized holiday on the first Saturday in November. In 2016, President Barack Obama signed a law making the American bison as the national mammal of the United States. The US has come a long way in the protection of this grand animal, which was on the verge of extinction just over a century ago. The establishment of the American Bison Society in 1905, of which President Theodore Roosevelt was a founder, helped spearhead conservation efforts and bring these giants back from the brink.

> Drifting along our shores and into our calendar, it's World Jellyfish Day! Jellyfish can be found in all the world's oceans, in all shapes and sizes. There are about 2,000 species, all lacking hearts, bones, and brains. Pacific sea nettle jellyfish, seen here, have vibrant golden-brown coloring and long tentacles and inhabit the coastal waters of California and Oregon. Moon jellyfish are pale with short tentacles, and, in an appropriate twist, went into orbit aboard the space shuttle Columbia in 1991, to help scientists study their unique biology. Jellyfish play a vital role in the ocean's food chain, as the main food source for many animals, including sea turtles. Their numbers are impacted by climate change, marine pollution, and overfishing, and in turn have reverberating effects on sea life around them.

> Stretching for miles below the desert sun, the salt flats of Badwater Basin shine in Death Valley National Park, California. This sweltering spot is the lowest point of elevation in North America, 282 feet below sea level. In this otherworldly landscape, the hardened mineral surface glistens like a mirror as the scorching heat dances upon it, creating rippling waves in the air. Composed of sodium chloride, borax, and other minerals, the flats' brittle crust conceals a treacherous mud layer beneath. For those who venture beyond the flats and up a mountainside, Dante's View reveals a panoramic view of Badwater Basin from a height of nearly 5,500 feet. With its surreal landscapes, Death Valley National Park serves up unique beauty in the harshest of conditions.

<summary>Description</summary>

> November is National Native American Heritage Month, a commemoration that invites us to delve into Native peoples' traditions, languages, and art forms. There are millions of Native Americans across the US, with hundreds of tribes and groups, each with their own culture. In Arizona, Canyon de Chelly National Monument preserves the ruins of Indigenous tribes that have lived here over the past 5,000 years, including Ancestral Puebloans, who built the ancient village in our homepage image, and the Navajo, who arrived here around 1700. Carved by the relentless forces of nature, the canyon is owned by the Navajo people who manage it in cooperation with the National Park Service. Some Navajo families still live here, keeping traditions alive in one of North America's longest continuously inhabited landscapes.

> Halloween is here! A night when glowing jack-o'-lanterns decorate doorsteps across the country. The custom has its roots in 19th-century Ireland, where turnips and potatoes were sculpted into scary faces. When Irish immigrants arrived in the US, they found pumpkins much easier to carve and a new tradition was born. The digital age has made things easier still, for those whose carving skills are not up to scratch. This image was created with Bing Image Creator (now even better with DALL·E 3)—create your own jack-o'-lantern with the power of AI.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The common raven is an intelligent and adaptable bird known for its striking appearance and remarkable behaviors. This elegant bird is easily identified by its characteristic wedge-shaped tail and glossy black feathers. Their keen eyesight and agile flight make them proficient hunters, often scavenging for prey or stealing from other predators. Ravens are known for their playful behavior and their omnivorous diet, feeding on a wide variety of foods, including carrion, insects, and small mammals.
> 
> Revered across various cultures, ravens have frequently appeared in literature and legends. In Edgar Allan Poe's famous poem, 'The Raven,' this bird serves as a symbol of death and melancholy, haunting the protagonist with its ominous refrain of 'nevermore.' Native American folklore often portrays the raven as a cunning and mystical trickster, with some tribes believing it possessed the power to shape-shift. Ravens also feature prominently in Norse mythology where they were considered to be wise messengers of the god Odin.

> Cemeteries are not usually tourist attractions but Bonaventure Cemetery in Savannah, Georgia, defies expectations. The city is often referred to as the most haunted in America, so devotees to all things spooky head here to test their nerves. A cemetery since 1846, the 160-acre site is perched on a bluff overlooking the Wilmington River. Its oak trees, dripping with Spanish moss, loom over walkways, monuments, and elaborate burial vaults. If it sounds like stepping into a southern Gothic novel, you're on the right track: The cemetery featured in John Berendt's 1994 bestseller 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.' Among the famous figures resting here is poet Conrad Aiken, whose grave is mentioned in the novel. His tombstone is a bench, said to have been designed to allow poetry lovers somewhere to sit to enjoy a drink in these soul-stirring surroundings.
