<summary>Description</summary>

> The Celtic Colours International Festival begins today in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, Canada. This festival celebrates the area's inhabitants, including 19th-century settlers who came from Scotland and Ireland. Because of Cape Breton Island's isolation and the lack of outside influences, the culture and traditions of these settlers remained particularly strong. Held when the island's fall colors are most vibrant, the festival has blossomed into a nine-day extravaganza that coincides with the warm red, orange, and yellow autumn foliage.
> 
> The 2024 edition continues the tradition of showcasing the best in Celtic music, dance, and art, featuring internationally acclaimed performers, local legends, and newcomers. The festival also offers workshops, Celtic knot quilting, art exhibitions, and a variety of gastronomic delights. Festivalgoers can also enjoy Cape Breton's scenic beauty, including its coastal vistas and the breathtaking fall sunrise in the highlands, as seen in today's image.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This fiery tumbleweed is kochia, which transforms landscapes when it takes on hues of red, orange, and pink in the fall. In the spring and summer, this annual herb resembles a fluffy green ball. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, kochia, also known as 'summer cypress,' is now widespread throughout the world. But it has a special place in Japan's Hitachi Seaside Park, seen in today's image, where around 30,000–40,000 kochia bushes are planted each year. These ornamental plants create a surreal landscape for visitors to wander through and also hold significance in Japanese culture. Historically, they have been dried to create brooms. However, not all parts of the kochia are destined to sweep the Earth—some are used for food. The plant's nuts, 'tonburi,' often called 'field caviar,' are a prized garnish.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Slender white trunks reaching skyward and leaves fluttering even in the gentlest breeze—aspen trees are a symbol of the American wilderness. Found across the western states, especially in Utah and Colorado, these trees are the most widespread native species in North America. Their fall foliage is breathtaking, with their leaves turning a vibrant yellow that lights up the landscape, as seen in today's photo, which was taken in the White River National Forest, Colorado.
> 
> Aspens are not only beautiful but also biologically fascinating. They grow in large colonies that originate from a single root system, making them some of the largest living organisms on Earth. Each tree in the colony is genetically identical. When an aspen tree is cut down or damaged, the root system remains alive, allowing new shoots to emerge and grow, which helps create a tenacious network that can survive harsh conditions, including wildfires. This species quickly colonizes areas that have been recently burned down and can regenerate even after frequent fires. Aspen trees are more than just a treat for the eyes; they are an example of nature's resilience.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today, we celebrate a creature with three hearts and the uncanny ability to change color at will: the octopus. Octopuses are cephalopods, marine animals like squids and cuttlefish that have tentacles. Among their many species is the small and shy mototi octopus, pictured here. It was discovered in 1999 around Rapa Island in the South Pacific and is known for the 'fake eyes' or ocelli—vibrant blue and yellow rings—between its eyes and arms. Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia, and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown color but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous. But you don't need to worry about running into one, because they tend to be shy and solitary, often hiding in crevices, shells, or human-made objects like bottles and cans.

> Build your excitement—it's World Architecture Day! Today's image features the Elbphilharmonie on the Grasbrook peninsula of the Elbe River in Hamburg, Germany. Designed by the Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron, this concert hall is a modern architectural marvel perched atop an old brick warehouse from 1963. A centerpiece of the new Hafencity development, it's Hamburg's tallest inhabited building—there are 45 luxury apartments in the upper floors—reaching a height of 354 feet.
> 
> The Elbphilharmonie features three concert venues: the Great Concert Hall, which seats 2,100; the Recital Hall, accommodating 550 for recitals, chamber music, and jazz; and the Kaistudio, a 170-seat space for educational activities. This fusion of history and innovation at the Elbphilharmonie offers a glimpse into thoughtful and creative architecture.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Sorano is a serene medieval village perched atop a cliff in the Italian province of Grosseto, southern Tuscany. Walking through the age-old cobblestone streets, one can explore the Fortezza Orsini, a fortress-turned-museum that dates back to the 11th century. Visitors engage with centuries-old tales of power and defense with each step they take inside the fort. Near Poggio San Rocco and Poggio Croce hills lies a necropolis—a large, ancient burial site—with well-preserved Etruscan tombs that hint at the area's long history. The Etruscan civilization inhabited this area and flourished in what is now Tuscany and Umbria between the 8th and 3rd centuries BCE.
> 
> The hidden valleys of Sorano are home to the Vie Cave, an intricate network of pathways possibly used as a defense system against invaders and wild animals. Here, cooks craft local specialties, maintaining culinary traditions passed down through generations. Stopping at an enoteca—a wine shop—for a glass of the esteemed Morellino di Scansano wine is a must for any visitor to Sorano.

> Today we celebrate the real influencers—Happy World Teachers' Day! Every year on October 5, we recognize the essential role of teachers in nurturing young minds, while acknowledging the challenges they face.
> 
> Pictured in today's image, African elephants, the largest land mammals, are celebrated for their extraordinary intelligence. Elephants are remarkable teachers, guiding their young on how to find water, safe food, and navigate complex social dynamics. Through gentle nudging, vocalizations, and demonstrations, elephant mothers pass down vital knowledge that helps their young survive in the wild. Sadly, they face significant threats from habitat loss and poaching. As we admire these majestic creatures and strive to protect them, we can learn valuable lessons about empathy, cooperation, and the importance of community—reminding us that, just like elephants, we never forget a great teacher.

As civilizations rise and fall around them, these hardy trees remain resilient and steadfast.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
