<summary>Description</summary>

> Within the vast expanse of England's Peak District National Park lies Kinder Scout Nature Reserve, the site of an historic people's protest. At around 2,087 feet, Kinder Scout is the park's highest point and its rugged moorlands and windswept plateaus have drawn walkers and nature enthusiasts for generations. In 1932, it was the stage for a 'mass trespass,' in which hundreds of people on foot protested for public access to these lands. At the time, many areas of open countryside were closed to the British public. This act of civil disobedience prompted much public sympathy, which eventually led to the establishment of the UK's first national parks. The Peak District National Park was the first, designated in April 1951, ensuring that these hills and valleys would be preserved for future generations to enjoy.

> The United States of America has had 46 commanders in chief, and today, the third Monday of February, we commemorate their legacies. Initially established to honor George Washington's birthday, Presidents Day has evolved into a celebration of all presidents. Revered among them is Abraham Lincoln, a towering figure in American history, who guided the country through the Civil War and abolished slavery in America. The Lincoln Memorial, seen in today's image, overlooks the Reflecting Pool at the west end of the National Mall in Washington, DC. Designed in a neoclassical style, the memorial is a poignant destination for those seeking to connect with American history during Presidents Day, and beyond.

> Ahoy there, giants of the sea! World Whale Day is surfacing, along with these sperm whales off the coast of the Caribbean island of Dominica. Established in 1980 in Maui, the day originally aimed to celebrate the humpback whales in Hawaiian waters but has evolved into a global event for all 92 whale species.
> 
> In the world of whales, you're either baleen or toothed. Baleen whales use bristle-like plates in their mouths to filter krill from the water. The sperm whales pictured here are toothed whales, which use cone-shaped teeth to attack their prey. Unlike baleen whales, they hunt and navigate using echolocation, using sound to detect objects around them. Sperm whales also happen to have the largest brain of any animal on Earth.

> All eyes are on hippos today! The world's third-largest land mammals after elephants and white rhinos, hippopotamuses are found in rivers and lakes throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Despite their size—they can weigh up to 4 tons—they are vulnerable to various threats, including habitat loss.

> The peeping calf in today's image is still under the watchful eye of its mother and will continue to be so until nursing ends at about 8 months. These chubby mammals might seem cute, but their strong jaws, large teeth, and aggressive behavior make them one of the world's most dangerous wild animals. So, admire them from a safe distance—despite their short legs, they are also fast runners!
