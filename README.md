<summary>Description</summary>

> Tucked along the Algarve coast in Portugal is the Benagil Cave, carved by the relentless power of the sea. Called Algar de Benagil in Portuguese, this sea cave, seen in today's image, draws adventurers, photographers, and nature enthusiasts from across the world. With its limestone walls, circular skylight, and turquoise waters, its interior looks like a natural cathedral.
> 
> Benagil Cave wasn't sculpted overnight—it was formed over millions of years by coastal erosion, shaped mostly by waves, currents, and tides. The cave's most distinctive feature is its 'eye,' a natural opening in the ceiling that bathes the interior in sunlight, creating a stunning interplay of light and shadow. The cave is located near Benagil, a village on the Atlantic coast in the municipality of Lagoa. Until the late 20th century, Benagil was a traditional fishing village, with its economy deeply rooted in ocean fishing. Over the years, it has transformed into a thriving tourist destination, thanks in part to its beach, Praia de Benagil. The region, including the Benagil Cave, showcases a perfect harmony of nature's wonders and the charms of Portugal's coastline.

> Today, we celebrate International Beaver Day. Established in 2009 by Beavers Wetlands & Wildlife, this day highlights the vital role beavers play in our ecosystems. Beavers are remarkable creatures known for their dam-building skills, which create wetlands, benefiting numerous species. As North America's largest rodents, they can grow up to 3 feet long, not including their distinctive flat tails. Their continuously growing teeth, with thick enamel giving them an orange hue, are essential tools for gnawing on trees—a behavior that maintains both their dental health and their environment. No wonder their strong choppers make them one of nature's best engineers. Who knew a furry little architect could have such a big impact on nature?

<summary>Description</summary>

> Libraries are magical places. They are home to books full of stories and knowledge, provide easy access to resources that might not be affordable for all, and offer spaces for book clubs, author talks, and other social gatherings. Without a doubt, our society benefits from libraries in several ways. To motivate people to read and take advantage of these institutions, the National Book Committee initiated an event series. The first National Library Week was celebrated in 1958 with the action slogan, 'Wake Up and Read!' This year, the annual National Library Week starts on April 6, which coincides with National Library Day. Some libraries will amaze us not only with their collection of books but also with their architecture. The George Peabody Library at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore has earned the prestigious nickname, 'the cathedral of books.' Take today's image as inspiration for the theme of the 2025 National Library Week: 'Drawn to the Library.'

<summary>Description</summary>

> Gaztelugatxe is a stunning islet located on the coast of Biscay in the Basque Country, Spain. It's famous for its dramatic scenery and the small hermitage dedicated to John the Baptist at its peak. San Juan de Gaztelugatxe, which dates back to the 10th century, has been rebuilt several times due to damage from battles and fire. Today's building is perched atop the islet and is accessible by a narrow path that includes 241 steps. It's a popular pilgrimage site, and visitors often ring the church bell three times and make a wish. According to legend, John the Baptist himself set foot on the islet. The views from the top offer panoramic vistas of the rugged coastline and the Cantabrian Sea. Gaztelugatxe gained international fame as a filming location for the TV series 'Game of Thrones,' where it served as Dragonstone, the ancestral seat of House Targaryen.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Every spring, Washington, DC, transforms into a sea of pink and white as the cherry trees bloom, marking the return of the National Cherry Blossom Festival. This beloved event commemorates the 1912 gift of 3,000 cherry trees from Tokyo's Mayor Yukio Ozaki to the US, symbolizing the friendship between the two nations.
> 
> This year's festival runs through April 13, with the peak bloom period expected to last four to seven days, depending on the weather. The Tidal Basin is the most popular spot for viewing, offering breathtaking scenes near landmarks like the Jefferson Memorial and the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial. If you prefer a quieter experience, check out Dumbarton Oaks or the National Arboretum for off-the-beaten-path beauty. Will you be visiting this year? If so, we recommend you arrive early in the morning or in the evening for the best views and fewer crowds. And remember—look, but don't touch! Picking the blossoms is against the law and harms the trees.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Have you ever spotted a rainbow and felt a little lucky? National Find a Rainbow Day, celebrated today, is all about looking to the sky for that magical mix of sun and rain. Nature's color wheel has long been linked to myths and legends, from Norse gods to the Irish leprechaun's pot of gold. But beyond folklore, the science behind rainbows is just as compelling. The first real explanation came from Theodoric of Freiberg, a German physicist, in 1304. He discovered that rainbows form when sunlight enters a raindrop, bends, reflects inside, and then bends again as it exits. This process splits light into its colors, creating the spectrum we see. The classic 'ROYGBIV' (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet) doesn't tell the whole story—rainbows contain millions of colors blended together.
> 
> Not all rainbows look the same. Double rainbows occur when a fainter, reversed arc appears above the main one. Moonbows happen at night when moonlight refracts through water droplets. The rare supernumerary rainbow features extra pastel bands inside the primary arc. Today's image features a rainbow over Wasson Peak in Saguaro National Park, Arizona. Against a backdrop of desert cacti and rocky slopes, the vibrant arc stands out in a place where rain is scarce, proving that even the driest landscapes can surprise you.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Wavy sandstone ridges stretch across the Caineville Badlands in Utah, resembling nature's brushstrokes on stone. These formations are made of fine-grained sediment that settled in ancient river deltas and inland seas and later hardened into stone. Over time, erosion carved through the layers, exposing flowing, ripple-like patterns. The sedimentary layers tell a story of shifting climates and ancient landscapes. The barren land may appear lifeless, but during early spring, rainfall causes the terrain to be blanketed with tiny purple and yellow flowers. While much of the terrain remains rugged, some areas offer easy access, allowing visitors to explore without strenuous hiking.
> 
> Badlands exist on every continent except Antarctica. Early explorers named them after struggling to navigate harsh terrains. Fossil hunters frequently uncover remnants of prehistoric creatures in the eroded hills. Despite the extreme conditions, badlands support a wide range of life, including desert plants, lizards, and birds.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
