<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to Oktoberfest, the world's biggest beer festival, held each year in the German city of Munich. Dating back all the way to 1810, it began with the wedding of Crown Prince Ludwig, later Ludwig I of Bavaria, and Princess Therese von Sachsen-Hildburghausen. The celebrations took place on the fields in front of the city gates, which were named Theresienwiese, or Theresa's Meadow, in honor of the bride. The festivities lasted for five days, filled with exciting activities such as parades and horse races. It was so popular that Oktoberfest became an annual event that now draws more than 6 million people. This year's festival starts today and lasts 18 days. Beyond Munich, it has become a popular celebration in multiple countries, and cities inside and outside of Germany imitate the festival and cherish its German traditions.

> From early Spanish colonialism to modern day civil rights struggles, the timeline of Hispanic and Latino history in the US is a rich one. Hispanic Heritage Month—September 15 to October 15—is dedicated to the history, culture, and heritage grounded in Latin America. It began as Hispanic Week in 1968 and has since evolved into a 30-day celebration. Why does it start in the middle of the month? September 15 sees the first of a series of independence days in several Latin American countries—El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. They are followed by Mexico, Chile, and Belize, which mark theirs on September 16, 18, and 21, respectively.

> Pictured here are the ruins of the mission church at Quarai in New Mexico, completed in 1632 under the direction of Spanish Franciscan friars. It is one of the three Spanish mission sites that form the Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument. Visiting the ruins is a great way to participate in Hispanic Heritage Month.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Hustai National Park in Mongolia is home to a very special and rare breed, the Przewalski's horse. Regarded by some as the only truly pure wild horse today, it is easily recognized by its pale yellowish-brown coat, a short, stiff mane, and short legs. The Przewalski's horse, also called the 'takhi' in Mongolia, was once extinct in the wild but has been successfully reintroduced through conservation efforts in the 1990s. An interesting fact about these horses is that they have 66 chromosomes, compared with 64 in domestic horses. Remarkably, Przewalski's horses can mate with domestic horses to produce hybrids. These hybrids have 65 chromosomes and can breed and have their own offspring.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Hampi is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Karnataka, India. The group of monuments—ancient temples, majestic palaces, and intricate ruins—are remnants of the former capital city of the Vijayanagara Empire, which ruled much of South India between the 14th and 16th centuries.
> 
> The city grew during the reign of King Krishnadevaraya, from 1509 to 1529, and was famed for its art and architecture, attracting visitors from all over the world. However, Hampi lost its Midas touch in 1565, when it was destroyed after the defeat of its army at the Battle of Talikota.
> 
> Today, Hampi still houses about 1,000 ancient monuments and has become popular with modern backpackers, giving the lost city a new life. One of the most visited parts is Hemakuta Hill, with its well-preserved temples and shrines. While exploring the hill, visitors can stop by to offer prayers at the Virupaksha Temple, a pilgrimage site dedicated to Lord Shiva.

<summary>Description</summary>

> On September 11, Patriot Day is observed as a national day of service and remembrance to honor the 2,977 people who died in the attacks on the United States in 2001. Congress established the day in 2002 with bipartisan support, and ever since, US government buildings, both domestic and abroad, fly the American flag at half-staff. Many citizens and businesses do the same in remembrance. Patriot Day also honors the hard work and sacrifice of the first responders who bravely put themselves in harm's way in the hours and days after the attacks.

> Today's image is of the Brooklyn Bridge with 'Tribute in Light' in the background, a display of 88 searchlights arranged in two columns that represent the Twin Towers that fell. Originally a temporary display, the annual installation illuminates the sky with columns of light from dusk until dawn. It is a stark reminder of the lives that were tragically lost in Manhattan, Pennsylvania, and at the Pentagon.

> Have you called your nana, abuela, pop-pop or lolo lately? No matter what you call them, there's no better time to pick up the phone than Grandparents' Day, held on the Sunday after Labor Day. Grandparents play a special role in our lives, helping to raise new generations, passing down family history and sharing the wisdom of their experience. Wisdom is not always indicated by a thick Wilford-Brimley-esque mustache, but whiskers do lend a certain esteemed quality. Perhaps that's why these Atlantic walruses look like they're about to tell you why they voted for Hubert Humphrey.
