> Family time during the holidays isn't always harmonious. Sometimes you might be tempted to channel this chinstrap penguin and give your nearest and dearest an earful. If you need a break from all the seasonal joy, Festivus might be the holiday for you. The idea was popularized in a 'Seinfeld' episode, which detailed the Costanza family's December 23 traditions, including putting up an unadorned aluminum Festivus pole and airing their year-end personal grievances. Since the episode debuted in 1997, Festivus has taken on a life of its own both among fans and people looking for an alternative way to celebrate the season. While most embrace the trappings of the holiday season, Festivus is for the rest of us.

<summary>Description</summary>

> What a lovely city! The Slavic word 'ljub' means 'to love,' and it's right there in the name of Slovenia's capital city, Ljubljana, and the Ljubljanica River that runs through it. This relatively small capital, with a population of just under 300,000, grew up on a trade route connecting the northern Adriatic Sea and the Danube region. While modern buildings skirt the city's periphery, its core preserves historic structures, some of which date back to ancient Rome. The Ljubljana Castle, pictured in the center of today's homepage image, has towered over the city for 900 years. Other sights include the Triple Bridge, the Dragon Bridge, and the historic Old Town. Keep an eye out while you stroll around; you might encounter the city's symbol, the Ljubljana Dragon.

> Frost-covered birch trees add a graceful touch to this winter landscape in the German state of Bavaria. This region is home to the villages of Uffing and Schöffau, on the shores of Staffelsee lake, and is often covered in mist and snow, creating an ethereal ambience. A winter chill is to be expected today, on the shortest day of the year. Typically falling on December 21, the solstice marks the beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere. While we're wrapping up warm, the Southern Hemisphere is celebrating the start of summer on their longest day of the year.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Val Gardena in Northern Italy is a popular destination for skiing, rock climbing, and woodcarving enthusiasts, which transforms into Christmas Valley at this time of year. Wooden huts open their doors to visitors, and a nostalgic cable car ride, each cabin adorned with twinkling fairy lights, travels above snow-covered slopes. During the 18th century, the valley became famous for its production of intricately carved wooden figurines, initially made to decorate Catholic churches. Among those creations, the peg wooden doll emerged as one of Val Gardena's best-known products and is still being produced today.

Christmas decorations light up the Royal Route, which extends south from the Royal Castle on Castle Square, where a nearly 30-foot-tall Christmas tree is installed for the holiday season, to Wilanów Palace. Bundled patrons wander through Warsaw's Christmas Market, browsing through seasonal souvenirs while savoring a warm beverage. The Royal Castle and surrounding Old Town have been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1980.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Carved by time, wind, and water, Capitol Reef National Park showcases rust-hued cliffs and the natural beauty of the American West. The park was named after a series of Navajo sandstone domes said to resemble the US Capitol Building and the Waterpocket Fold, a huge ridge in the Earth's crust, which was referred to as a reef by prospectors. This 100-mile-long monocline—a step-like fold—is thought to have formed around 50 to 70 million years ago, and is home to towering cliffs, narrow canyons, and colorful rock formations. Capitol Reef was established as a national monument in 1937 and was designated a national park on December 18, 1971.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Among their feathered friends, Bohemian waxwings cut striking figures with their pointed crests, 'blushing' faces, and velvety gray plumage with splashes of color. Large groups wander across the northern US and Canada in search of food, swooping on trees and shrubs to find fruit. In winter, they feast upon cotoneaster, juniper, and rowan berries. As spring casts its spell, these nomads settle down for the breeding season. The female waxwings craft the nests, laying two to six bluish-gray eggs, and hatchlings are fed a diet of insects and fruits by both parents. One can easily spot these sociable birds, as they often gather in chirpy flocks in North America and Eurasia.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska.
