> Is there another animal that has as coveted a life as the sloth? Your answer depends on how highly you rate the ability to just laze around all day, but in honor of International Sloth Day, let's all just embrace slothfulness. If you want to live the sloth life, head outside and hang upside down in the nearest tree. You won't be able to dangle there as long as a sloth though, because they spend most of their lives doing it. Their arms, legs, hands, and feet evolved for literally 'hanging around' like the pair of Hoffmann's two-toed sloths in today's photo.
> 
> Two-toed sloths might be better named as two-fingered: They have three toes on their hind legs. Even still, two-toed and three-toed sloths are distantly related, despite a shared preference for living the slow life in rainforests. The mother and child in today's photo are chilling together in a coastal town of Costa Rica. They won't be together forever, though, as part of the sloth's 'best life' is living alone. Adult sloths rarely interact with one another—though sometimes females will get together and, assumedly, hang out.

<summary>Description</summary>

> As you glance over today's photo of the trees changing color in the Thuringian Forest in Germany, make note of the castle in the distance. That's Wartburg, a castle built in the Middle Ages that holds significance to Christians. It was the home of St. Elizabeth of Thuringia (aka St. Elizabeth of Hungary), and later, where Martin Luther translated the New Testament into German while in exile. Wartburg is the area's most popular tourist attraction and has been recognized for its quintessential medieval architecture.
> 
> There's some clever wordplay in the name Wartburg. 'Warte' is German for both 'watchtower' and 'wait.' Tradition suggests the castle's founder, upon seeing this forested hillside, exclaimed 'Warte, Berg—du sollst mir eine Burg tragen!' or 'Wait, mountain—you shall bear my castle!' Note the 'berg' and 'burg' in that quote, which translate to mountain and fortress, respectively. And so in the grand German tradition of mashing words together, the name Wartburg came to be.
> 
> If the castle isn't of interest to you, the Thuringian Forest, known as the Green Heart of Germany, has plenty of its own charm for tourists. The oldest and most popular long-distance hiking trail in Germany, the Rennsteig, runs for about 110 miles within the forest. If you're out for a hike you'll notice the general quietness of the area and fresh, unpolluted air. You may even happen upon the tiny villages that pepper the area and have a reputation for welcoming outsiders.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Considered one of the world's most important architectural works of the past few decades, the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao celebrates its 25th anniversary today. To commemorate the event, the museum has unveiled a slogan: 'Art Inspires Future.' The museum has also released a special edition of its logo in which the characteristic Gs of the Guggenheim brand move like gears to shape the number 25. Perhaps they'll serve cake as well?
> 
> Designed by famed Canadian American architect Frank Gehry, the museum not only changed the skyline of Bilbao, Spain, by transforming the city's decrepit port area, it changed the entire way the city was perceived by the world. Architect Philip Johnson called it 'the greatest building of our time.' The acclaim was echoed by critic Calvin Tomkins, writing in The New Yorker, who characterized it as 'a fantastic dream ship of undulating form in a cloak of titanium.'
> 
> Since its opening on this day in 1997, the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao is credited with renewing the Spanish city from a gritty industrial backwater into a glitzy travel hotspot—a metamorphosis now described as the 'Bilbao effect.' Cities around the world have been attempting to repeat the formula: Hire a 'starchitect' to put a neglected locale on the cultural map, which will in turn attract more investment, prestigious brands, and tourism. Some attempts have been more successful than others, but there's no denying that Bilbao has long since arrived.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Whooo is that up in that tree? Why, that's just a typical long-eared owl, sometimes called the lesser horned owl or cat owl. It's one of the most numerous owl species in the world with an estimated population between 2 million and 5.5 million long-eared owls widely distributed across the Northern Hemisphere. Our featured friend today was found in the Czech Republic, but they'll adapt to several kinds of habitats.
> 
> Maybe that adaptability is why they're unusually social, as far as owls go. They'll often roost together in large groups—anywhere from 20 to 100 of them may hunker down together for the winter. You might think it would be easy to see such a large group of owls, but long-eared owls are sneaky. They hide in thick cover, which makes them harder to find, especially when their feathers blend in with the surrounding branches and foliage. Early spring, before the leaves have fully returned, is the most likely time you'd catch a glimpse of a 'parliament,' or group, of long-eared owls.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The sheer size of Greenland is hard to put in perspective. The world's largest island is more than 836,000 square miles—that's more than three times the size of Texas and 170,000 square miles larger than Alaska. It is a land of deep fjords and thick ice that must have made the Norse explorers feel right at home when they landed there a thousand years ago.
> 
> Today we find ourselves at the southern tip of Greenland, in Prince Christian Sound, a fjord system 60 miles long, at times as narrow as 1,500 feet across. It flows through steep canyons of granite with slopes rising 1,200 feet above the water. The placid calm of these waters is frequently disrupted by calving glaciers, breaching whales, and the cruise ships that visit the region. The only human habitation in this frozen landscape is the Inuit village of Aappilattoq, home to about 100 people.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Naqsh-e Rostam is an ancient necropolis carved into the mountains of southwestern Iran, a porthole into one of the earliest civilizations to flourish in ancient Persia. The tombs of four Achaemenid kings (you can see three of them here) are marked by rock reliefs carved high above the ground into the cliff face. This site and the area around it are of huge significance to the history of Iran and its people. They're also a shining example of the role archaeology plays in understanding our past. On the third Saturday of every October, we pause to celebrate and recognize the contributions of archaeologists as interpreters of human history.
> 
> 'Necropolis,' the word for a complex of tombs and burial plots, literally translates as 'city of the dead.' This one is close to the ruins of the ancient Achaemenid ceremonial capital of Persepolis. One of the tombs is identified by an inscription as being the resting place of Darius I, aka Darius the Great, and the others are believed to be the tombs of Darius' son, Xerxes I, Artaxerxes I, and Darius II, leaders during the Achaemenid dynasty from 522-330 BCE. Naqsh-e Rostam is also home to relief carvings depicting kings of the later Sasanian Empire, the last Iranian empire before the Muslim conquests of the 7th and 8th centuries. Only a few hundred yards away is the archaeological site known as Naqsh-e Rajab, with more rock carvings depicting three Sassanid kings and a high priest. While these civilizations have faded, what they created endures as a permanent record of human history.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Striking in any season, but particularly beautiful in years when the warmth of summer stretches into fall, the Pyrenees have served as a natural border between the Iberian Peninsula and the rest of Europe since the earliest civilizations took root there. Located in the center of the range, Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park was created in 1918 and expanded in 1982. Today it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
> 
> Boasting sheer cliffs and deep, verdant valleys, the park is a photographer's dream, with a landscape defined by dramatic geological landforms and diverse ecosystems shaped by the drastic elevation changes of the Pyrenees. The region is home to several species that can only be found here, including the Pyrenean chamois and the Pyrenean desman, or water mole. The mammal considered the most rare and important in the region, the bucardo or Pyrenean ibex, went extinct in January 2000 despite preservation efforts.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
