<summary>Description</summary>

> Picture a city where your daily commute offers views of fjords, drifting ice, and the Northern Lights. That's everyday life in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland—a small yet spirited Arctic hub blending Inuit heritage with Nordic modernity. Founded in 1728 by Danish-Norwegian missionary Hans Egede, it began as a small settlement called Godthaab—'Good Hope.'
> 
> Nuuk preserves 18th-century landmarks like the Hans Egede House and the red wooden Nuuk Cathedral. The Greenland National Museum displays Inuit artifacts and the well-preserved Qilakitsoq mummies, offering a glimpse into the island's deep past. This city is also home to the world's only Arctic golf course. But it's not just the sights that define Nuuk—it's how people come together when the cold sets in.
> 
> Winter brings short days and snowfall, yet the city buzzes with life. People head out for cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, boating, or dog sledding along the fjords. Indoors, friends gather for 'kaffemik'—a cozy coffee-and-cake tradition with strong Greenlandic coffee topped with whipped cream. Nuuk shows that life in the cold isn't about endurance—it's about balance, community, and finding color even in the depths of winter.

<summary>Description</summary>

> What stands out about Londolozi Game Reserve in South Africa isn't just the wildlife—it's the long-term commitment behind it. Since 1926, its 58 square miles have supported research and monitored wildlife behavior in their natural habitat. Located within the Sabi Sand Private Game Reserve, it is home to Africa's Big Five. Londolozi is part of a larger open system that connects with Kruger National Park, allowing animals such as elephants, rhinos, lions, leopards, zebras, and many antelope species to move freely without fences holding them back.
> 
> Among the species frequently spotted are impalas—always moving, always alert. Their adaptable feeding habits help them shift between flowering plants, acacia pods, forbs, and fruits as the seasons change. Their social structure is just as interesting: females and young gather in herds, while males compete for territories during the breeding season. Most young are born in early summer after a gestation period of six to seven months. Even though they're quick and agile, predators such as leopards, lions, and cheetahs keep them on edge. Drought cycles and habitat pressure add to the challenges, so protected spaces like Londolozi make a meaningful difference in their long-term survival.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Kings Mountain in Alaska's Chugach Mountains isn't just another bump on the horizon—it's the kind of rugged beauty that makes you slow down and stare. Rising over 5,800 feet and sitting roughly 22 miles northeast of Palmer, this peak towers over mile 75 of the Glenn Highway, a route famous for its dramatic scenery. Its slopes bear the marks of ancient glaciers, etched into ridges and valleys that seem tailor-made for adventure.
> 
> The Dena'ina name, Bashtl'ech' (black stone), speaks to its cultural roots, while its English name honors Al King, a prospector from Alaska's gold rush days. Today, hikers and climbers come for the challenge: steep ascents, unpredictable weather, and views so sweeping they feel like a hard-earned reward. On clear days, the Matanuska Glacier glimmers in the distance, and wildflowers brighten the rocky terrain, reminding you that even Alaska's wilderness has a soft side. Pack layers and a sense of humor—the weather changes fast—but if you're lucky, standing atop Kings Mountain feels like shaking hands with the sky.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Our picture of the day takes us to the Swiss village of Lauterbrunnen, where the Staubbach Falls shimmers in the distance beyond a quiet alpine valley. This is the landscape a young traveler, J.R.R. Tolkien, crossed during a hiking trip in 1911, long before he became the storyteller behind 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit.' Its soaring cliffs, silver waterfalls, and crisp mountain air left a lasting impression and are believed to have inspired his vision of Rivendell, the elven refuge hidden deep in Middle-earth.
> 
> On January 3—Tolkien's birthday—fans across the globe celebrate Tolkien Day, raising a toast at 9 PM to 'The Professor.' The tradition, started by The Tolkien Society in 1972, recalls both Frodo's toast to Bilbo and the writer's years at Oxford, where he spent a lifetime shaping modern fantasy—interweaving language, legend, and moral courage into timeless tales. Today, admirers honor not just an author but a world-maker—one who showed that even the smallest journey can lead to greatness, and that wonder awaits, ever-present, just beyond the familiar.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Seeing Venice from above is mesmerizing, but this Italian gem's true magic lies within its walls and waterways. Founded in the 5th century on a cluster of islands in the Venetian Lagoon, the early settlement rose from marshland to become a maritime powerhouse. By the Middle Ages, it had evolved into a major hub for trade between Europe and the East, fueling immense wealth and cultural growth. The city's grandeur shines through its Gothic palaces, Renaissance art, and landmarks such as St. Mark's Basilica, the Doge's Palace, and the Rialto Bridge.
> 
> Venice is celebrated not only for its iconic architecture and interwoven canals but also for the brilliant minds who shaped its legacy. 'The Travels of Marco Polo' chronicles the adventures of the Venetian merchant and explorer, and Antonio Vivaldi—composer of 'The Four Seasons'—was also born here. The city has inspired timeless works, including Thomas Mann's 'Death in Venice,' Shakespeare's 'The Merchant of Venice' and 'Othello,' and Henry James's novella 'The Aspern Papers.'
> 
> Today, Venice balances historic charm with modern challenges—from preserving fragile architecture to managing tourism. Gondolas glide past centuries-old facades, while festivals like Carnevale keep traditions alive.

> Do you feel as if you have a whole year's worth of rest to catch up on? Then you can relate to this Arctic fox, cozily tucked among the rocky outcroppings of the frozen tundra. Whether the new year greets you with biting cold or under a warm sun, take five extra minutes to stretch before diving into the 365 days ahead.
> 
> Ever wondered why we have 365 days in a year? It's because the Gregorian calendar—introduced in 1582—is based on a solar year: the time it takes Earth to orbit the sun. The stars have our backs, but the plans we make for the months ahead are all on us.
> 
> Let's start the year with a clean slate. Here are a few ideas for New Year's resolutions. Simple things like reading, taking nature walks, or practicing mindfulness cost nothing and can really boost your quality of life. Or maybe you're dreaming bigger: moving abroad, taking up scuba diving, or learning an endangered language? Take a deep breath—and perhaps sleep on it a little longer.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Three… two… one… wait—hold that countdown. It's not New Year's yet, but the Oberbaum Bridge already feels as if Berlin hit its 'celebrate' button ahead of time. On this night, the bridge transforms from a simple river crossing into a runway where this city taxis toward midnight, engines humming, fireworks warming up, and the crowd collectively practicing its 'Happy New Year!' voice.
> 
> Wedged perfectly between Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg, the bridge sits at the meeting point of two neighborhoods across the River Spree that approach the eve with completely different strategies. Friedrichshain shows up with club beats and street snacks. Kreuzberg brings laid-back bars and last-minute toasts. The Oberbaum Bridge? From here, the scene is pure improvisation—bursts of color from rooftops, random sparkles from the riverbanks, and occasional 'Was that meant to go sideways?' moments. The bridge's iconic red-brick towers watch over it all, steady and unfazed. These towers once marked the divide between East and West Berlin, but tonight they mark something far better: togetherness. Here's to crossing into another year—one step, one cheer, and one firework at a time.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
