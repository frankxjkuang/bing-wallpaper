<summary>Description</summary>

> Every first Saturday in September, bird enthusiasts and nature lovers gather to celebrate National Hummingbird Day. This day is dedicated to appreciating these tiny, agile birds and their role as a pollinator in our ecosystem. Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed; they can flap their wings up to 80 times per second, allowing them to hover in place and even fly backward. Emily Dickinson aptly describes their swift movement: 'A Route of Evanescence / With a revolving Wheel—.' Their high metabolism requires them to eat constantly, so they spend their days flitting from flower to flower, sipping nectar and catching insects. Fun fact: these birds can remember every flower they've visited and how long it will take a flower to refill with nectar.
> 
> Let's meet the Anna's hummingbird, seen in today’s image. Named after Anna Masséna, Duchess of Rivoli, it's one of an estimated 366 hummingbird species, and it's the most common species on North America's western coast. With its shimmering emerald feathers and sparkling rose-pink throat, this little bird is a sight to behold. So, today, let's spread our wings of awareness and protect these birds—one garden at a time.

This park spans nearly 3,000 acres of woodland, waterfalls, and wonder, and it boasts several walking trails, each offering its own unique perspective of the landscape. The most popular is the Waterfall Walkway, a 3-mile trail that passes through a National Nature Reserve and features the Ess-na-Crub and Ess-na-Larach waterfalls.

> As daylight fades, dusky eagle-owls, the silent hunters seen in today's image, emerge from their nests. These primarily nocturnal raptors were snapped in Pakistan and can be found in the forests and scrublands across South and Southeast Asia. An impressive wingspan of 15–17 inches, piercing yellow eyes, and exceptional hearing help them to catch small mammals and birds with precision in dim light. Measuring up to 2 feet tall, these feathered predators can also be spotted hunting in the daytime when the weather is cloudy. They often live in the abandoned nests of other birds or in natural crevices. Dusky eagle-owls breed in December and January, usually rearing their young in the safety of tall trees or cliff ledges. Nature lovers and bird watchers are captivated by their solemn gaze and elegant stature.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Sometimes it's nice to get away. Thanks to environmentalist Howard Zahniser, Americans can do that in one of the country's many wildernesses—sheltered from human activities. While the protection of national forests and parks began in the late 1800s, untamed wilderness had dwindled to only 2.5% of US land by the 1960s. To reverse this trend, Zahniser wrote most of what became the Wilderness Act. Signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson on September 3, 1964, today it protects more than 109 million acres—5% of the land in the US.
> 
> Pictured in today's image, Crystal Lake, in the Enchantments, Washington, is in one such protected area. Located in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, the Enchantments region has more than 700 lakes and ponds and some of the best rock climbing in the Western US. It's also home to mountain goats, ptarmigan, pikas, and many alpine flowers. If you want to see Alpine Lakes Wilderness yourself, however, be prepared to wait. Few permits are granted for day hikes, and of the 40,000 people who entered last year's lottery for overnight permits, only 2,558 received one.

> Take a load off this Labor Day weekend. One of 11 federal holidays, Labor Day honors America's workers and is celebrated on the first Monday of September. Its origins are rooted in late 1800s' efforts to recognize workers contributions, which ultimately led to the 40-hour work week. President Grover Cleveland made the US holiday official in 1894. Today, many Americans celebrate the long weekend, which is often considered the unofficial end of summer, by grilling, hanging out with friends and family, and going to parades.
> 
> Today's image, the 'Power of the Titans' mural by Andrei Krautsou, depicts railroads and industry in North Kansas City, Missouri. It adorns the wall of a local manufacturer whose heritage is also celebrated in the work. Kansas City is a major rail hub and one of the country's largest distribution centers—just the kind of place from which Krautsou, an artist from Belarus who is fascinated with cultures and histories, draws inspiration.

> 
> The Thames, the longest river entirely in England, contains more than 80 islands along its course. Starting in Gloucestershire in southwest England, it winds through cities like Oxford, Windsor, and London, pictured above, flowing for 215 miles before merging with the North Sea on the southeast coast. Once heavily polluted, it is now said to be one of the world's cleanest rivers flowing through a major city and is a haven for an array of wildlife including mute swans and bottlenose dolphins.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
