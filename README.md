> What better time to shine a spotlight on nature than on World Wildlife Day? This day serves as a reminder that wildlife conservation is a shared responsibility. This year's theme is 'Wildlife Conservation Finance: Investing in People and Planet.' The events emphasize exchanging ideas, presenting solutions, and diving into how innovative finance can help stop biodiversity loss and create a more sustainable future. Schools, conservation groups, and wildlife parks host events such as nature walks, workshops, art contests, wildlife photography competitions, and conservation talks to raise awareness.
> 
> One species worth learning about is the southern yellow-billed hornbill, pictured here, a bird found throughout Southern Africa and commonly spotted in Kruger National Park in South Africa. Recognizable by its curved, bright yellow bill, this bird is often seen hopping on the ground in search of food. Its diet includes insects, seeds, fruits, berries, nuts, and small reptiles, making it a key player in the ecosystem as both a predator and seed disperser. Social creatures, these hornbills are usually found in pairs or small groups, often foraging together. Their calls—whistling, grunting, and cackling—echo across the savanna.

> Today, we are in New South Wales, Australia, amid the Blue Mountains National Park. Known for its dramatic cliffs, dense rainforests, and cascading waterfalls, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is a treasure trove of natural beauty and biodiversity. Among the most iconic features of the Blue Mountains region are the eucalyptus trees, pictured here. Home to 92 species of eucalyptus, this area offers visitors a chance to marvel at these resilient trees, which are central to Australian wildlife. Their aromatic leaves provide food for koalas, while their bark and canopy create habitats for countless birds and insects.
> 
> Also nestled within the mountains is the Megalong Valley. Just a 2-hour drive from Sydney, this region is home to getaway cabins, wineries, and the Megalong Valley Tearooms, a charming retreat where you can enjoy freshly baked scones paired with local jams. Here, you can also explore the Six Foot Track, a historic trail originally carved in the 19th century for horseback riders. The Blue Mountains promise an unforgettable escape into the heart of Australia's wild beauty.

> Every March, as we celebrate Women's History Month, we honor the trailblazing women who've shaped our world. Central to this legacy is the suffrage movement—a courageous fight for women's right to vote.
> 
> Since the founding of the United States, voting rights had largely been restricted to men. It was only in the early 19th century that the fight for women's suffrage took root, alongside the movement to abolish slavery. Women like Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, pictured here, spearheaded efforts to challenge societal norms that denied political participation based on gender. The Seneca Falls Convention of 1848 marked a pivotal moment, where the Declaration of Sentiments boldly stated that 'all men and women are created equal.' Following decades of activism, including rallies, marches, and relentless petitioning, the 19th Amendment was ratified in 1920, finally granting women the right to vote. Beyond securing voting rights, the suffrage movement became a powerful catalyst for broader discussions on gender equality, inspiring future generations to continue the fight for justice.

> Welcome to the year 2152. That is, in the Tibetan calendar at least. Today marks the start of Losar, the new year festival celebrated in Tibetan Buddhism, which is observed in Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal, and parts of India. Losar celebrations run for 15 days, beginning the night before with a meal of guthuk—a traditional dumpling soup. The new year is rung in with an incense burning ceremony and visits to holy places to pray for good fortune in the year ahead.
> 
> Today's image takes us to Paro Taktsang, also known as the Tiger's Nest, a Buddhist monastery and holy site perched 10,000 feet above sea level in Bhutan. Built around the Taktsang Senge Samdup cave in 1692, it is where Guru Padmasambhava, who introduced Vajrayana Buddhism to Bhutan, meditated and taught his students. Paro Taktsang is made up of four main temples, all connected by stairways cut into the cliff face, as well as a handful of rickety bridges. In Bhutan, Losar is celebrated with picnics, dancing, darts, and the country's national sport: archery.

> Today we're heading north for International Polar Bear Day. This event is the perfect time to learn more about the world's largest bear species and the threats they face. Polar bears are native to the Arctic and can be found in Alaska, Russia, Greenland, and Svalbard. They're also found in Canada—like the cub in today's image, photographed in Churchill, Manitoba.
> 
> Polar bears spend over half of their time hunting for seals on the sea ice, although they usually catch just one or two for every 10 that they try to catch. Their reliance on sea ice for hunting means that they are highly vulnerable to climate change. Sea ice is rapidly disappearing as the planet heats up, and polar bears are at risk of malnutrition and starvation as their hunting grounds vanish. Shrinking ice sheets also mean that these bears have to swim farther to find food, which depletes their energy reserves. International Polar Bear Day is the perfect opportunity to reflect on how we can reduce our carbon footprints and contribute to the conservation of these amazing predators.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Perched dramatically on a tidal islet in Loch Laich, Argyll, Castle Stalker is one of Scotland's most picturesque and well-preserved medieval tower houses. Built around the 1440s by the Stewarts of Appin, its history includes royal visits and even a drunken wager that briefly transferred ownership to Clan Campbell. After falling into disrepair by the 19th century, it was lovingly restored in the mid-20th century and is still privately owned today. Visitors can explore this historic site on selected guided tours during the summer.
> 
> Its name, 'Stalker,' comes from the Scottish Gaelic 'Stalcaire,' meaning 'hunter' or 'falconer.' And while its striking appearance is certainly memorable, its fame may actually stem from another reason: Castle Stalker has captured imaginations in popular culture, appearing in 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' and the 'Black Mirror' episode 'Loch Henry.' Does it ring a bell now? Nestled in the scenic Lynn of Lorn National Scenic Area, it's an enduring symbol of Scotland's storied past.

> A breathtaking maze of sandstone formations and awe-inspiring views awaits you at Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah. People have lived in this area for at least 10,000 years, including the Anasazi, Pueblo, and Paiute Peoples. The hoodoos—tall, thin spires of rock formed by erosion—in the park inspired Paiute mythology: they believed them to be the Legend People turned to stone by the trickster Coyote.
> 
> The first European Americans arrived in the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and some eventually settled there in the 1850s. Bryce Canyon was named after Ebenezer Bryce, who had a homestead nearby. On this date in 1928, it was declared a national park. These days, the park is famous for its hoodoos. Every year, over 2 million visitors come to marvel at these geological formations. In fact, Bryce Canyon National Park has the highest concentration of hoodoos anywhere on Earth.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
