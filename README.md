<summary>Description</summary>

> They say the grass is always greener on the other side, and no one takes that more literally than the wildebeests of the Serengeti in Tanzania. Every July, roughly 2 million of these determined grazers, along with zebras and other herbivores, set off on a journey north to the Masai Mara in Kenya in search of lush pastures and fresh water. The great migration, considered one of the seven wonders of the natural world, is a safari spectacle where survival is the prize.
> 
> One of the most dramatic moments of the migration is the crossing of the Mara River at the border between Tanzania and Kenya. Thousands of wildebeests gather at the riverbank, aware that danger lurks beneath the surface—the crocodiles—not to mention the lions and leopards that patrol the banks. When the first wildebeest takes the plunge, it's a wild rush as the rest of the herd follows, creating a chaotic scene. Some make it across, while others become part of the food chain. As October rolls around and the rains return to the Serengeti, the herds begin their journey back south, completing the cycle once again.

> The second Monday of October is used by many to celebrate Indigenous Peoples' Day, as an alternative to Columbus Day, held on the same date. It highlights the customs and heritage of the Indigenous Peoples who lived in North America before the arrival of European settlers, and the devastating impact colonization had upon them.
> 
> Today's image takes us to one of the places that Indigenous Peoples' legacy can still be seen. In the rocks of the Grand Canyon, the Nankoweap Granaries were carved by the Ancestral Pueblo culture around 1100 CE. Used to keep the crops that were grown safe from the elements, these granaries could be fully sealed when needed. The Ancestral Pueblo people lived in the Four Corners region, building houses and other structures out of stone and adobe, or carving them into canyon walls.

> Today we're stepping into the heart of the historic empire of Islamic Spain. The Royal Alcázar of Seville, in the southern region of Andalusia, stands on the site of a 10th-century citadel, which was expanded over the following 200 years. When Christian forces captured the city in 1248, this historic palace was almost totally rebuilt in the Mudejar style, which takes inspiration from the intricate patterns and decorative motifs found in Islamic architecture. Within the Alcázar, there are several courtyards lined with delicately carved columns. One of these is the Patio de las Doncellas, or Courtyard of the Maidens, pictured here today.
> 
> In the center of this beautiful space is a pool, whose still waters provide reflections of not only the blue Andalucian sky above, but of the intricate latticework of the courtyard's arches. Look a little closer at these arches, and you'll see carved shells, Hands of Fatima—a symbol said to bring protection—plants, and Arabic script. Behind the columns, the walls are decorated with colorful ceramic tiles decorated with geometric patterns. These tiles, known as azulejos, are a hallmark of Andalusian decoration. Outside, there is a large garden full of fountains and tree-lined paths—a perfect spot to cool off from the hot Spanish sun.

> Celebrate our traveling feathered friends on World Migratory Bird Day! Some migrations are truly astounding. The bar-tailed godwit embarks on a 6,835-mile nonstop flight across the Pacific from Alaska to New Zealand. The tiny ruby-throated hummingbird, weighing less than a nickel, makes the trip all the way across the Gulf of Mexico. Migratory birds navigate the globe, instinctively knowing when and where to move to exploit seasonal abundance. The Arctic tern outshines them all with its intercontinental journey from pole to pole, covering roughly 25,000 miles in its annual round trip.
> 
> Let's take a moment to admire the vibrant plumage of the wood duck, photographed in Quebec, Canada. Wood ducks nest in tree cavities close to water and sometimes take advantage of human-made boxes. During the breeding season, from February to April, you'll find the females laying 7–15 eggs. From the eastern and western United States and southern Canada, these ducks migrate southward in the fall to avoid harsh winter conditions. By October and November, they move towards milder climates in the southeastern US and occasionally into Mexico.

> The Celtic Colours International Festival begins today in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, Canada. This festival celebrates the area's inhabitants, including 19th-century settlers who came from Scotland and Ireland. Because of Cape Breton Island's isolation and the lack of outside influences, the culture and traditions of these settlers remained particularly strong. Held when the island's fall colors are most vibrant, the festival has blossomed into a nine-day extravaganza that coincides with the warm red, orange, and yellow autumn foliage.
> 
> The 2024 edition continues the tradition of showcasing the best in Celtic music, dance, and art, featuring internationally acclaimed performers, local legends, and newcomers. The festival also offers workshops, Celtic knot quilting, art exhibitions, and a variety of gastronomic delights. Festivalgoers can also enjoy Cape Breton's scenic beauty, including its coastal vistas and the breathtaking fall sunrise in the highlands, as seen in today's image.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This fiery tumbleweed is kochia, which transforms landscapes when it takes on hues of red, orange, and pink in the fall. In the spring and summer, this annual herb resembles a fluffy green ball. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, kochia, also known as 'summer cypress,' is now widespread throughout the world. But it has a special place in Japan's Hitachi Seaside Park, seen in today's image, where around 30,000–40,000 kochia bushes are planted each year. These ornamental plants create a surreal landscape for visitors to wander through and also hold significance in Japanese culture. Historically, they have been dried to create brooms. However, not all parts of the kochia are destined to sweep the Earth—some are used for food. The plant's nuts, 'tonburi,' often called 'field caviar,' are a prized garnish.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Slender white trunks reaching skyward and leaves fluttering even in the gentlest breeze—aspen trees are a symbol of the American wilderness. Found across the western states, especially in Utah and Colorado, these trees are the most widespread native species in North America. Their fall foliage is breathtaking, with their leaves turning a vibrant yellow that lights up the landscape, as seen in today's photo, which was taken in the White River National Forest, Colorado.
> 
> Aspens are not only beautiful but also biologically fascinating. They grow in large colonies that originate from a single root system, making them some of the largest living organisms on Earth. Each tree in the colony is genetically identical. When an aspen tree is cut down or damaged, the root system remains alive, allowing new shoots to emerge and grow, which helps create a tenacious network that can survive harsh conditions, including wildfires. This species quickly colonizes areas that have been recently burned down and can regenerate even after frequent fires. Aspen trees are more than just a treat for the eyes; they are an example of nature's resilience.

Many live for millennia, their trunks growing thick and gnarled, and their branches bearing fruit century after century. As civilizations rise and fall around them, these hardy trees remain resilient and steadfast.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
