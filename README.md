> Every July, nature enthusiasts gather for National Moth Week to celebrate the beauty and diversity of moths. Featured in today's image is the luna moth, a species whose charm rivals that of butterflies. Also known as the American moon moth, this striking insect—with its lime-green wings and white body—can be found across North America. Its caterpillars are also green and known for their impressive size, as well as their ability to emit clicking sounds and regurgitate intestinal contents as a defense mechanism against predators.
> 
> National Moth Week, held during the last full week of July, encourages communities to host 'mothing' events, where participants use light or bait to attract moths for observation and data collection. This citizen science initiative began in 2012 in central New Jersey and has since expanded to over 90 countries, engaging people in the fascinating world of moths. With their incredible diversity and ecological importance, moths play crucial roles in pollination and serve as a vital food source for other wildlife.
> 
> So the next time you leave a light on during a balmy summer night, keep an eye out—one of these nocturnal visitors might just flutter by.

> Gulf Islands National Seashore spans the northern Gulf of Mexico along the coasts of Florida and Mississippi, offering recreational activities and preserving natural and historic sites. Established in 1971, it boasts miles of white sand beaches, historic fortifications, and rich wildlife habitats. The seashore includes a 4,080-acre wilderness area on Mississippi's Petit Bois and Horn Islands, protecting their unique ecosystems. Besides being a perfect spot for snorkeling, hiking, and swimming, the seashore is home to a wide range of wildlife including armadillos, dolphins, pelicans, and sea turtles.

> If you're looking for a scent-sational summer trip, follow your nose to the Plateau de Valensole in Provence, France. From late June to mid-July, this high plateau transforms into a purple sea of lavender. Situated more than 1,900 feet above sea level and spanning approximately 300 square miles, it is one of the largest areas in France dedicated to lavender cultivation.
> 
> Lavender has flourished in Provence for centuries. The ancient Romans brought the plant to southern France, using it for bathing, cooking, and healing. The word itself comes from 'lavare,' Latin for 'to wash.' By the Middle Ages, local monks were cultivating it for medicinal purposes. The real boom came in the 19th century, when the perfume industry in nearby Grasse took off. Over time, lavender fields spread across Provence, especially in high-sun, well-drained areas like Valensole. Today, 1,700 growers tend to around 62,000 acres of these shrubs. They cultivate both traditional lavender—for perfumes and skincare—and lavandin, the longer-stemmed cousin often found in household cleaning products and air fresheners. So don't just leave it to chance—plan ahead, follow the scent trail, and let your summer bloom with lavender memories.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The Temple of Philae, often called the Temple of Isis, is one of Egypt's most enchanting ancient sites. Originally built on Philae Island, it was moved to nearby Agilkia Island to save it from flooding. The international rescue effort, launched by UNESCO in the 1960s, required a monumental effort that involved moving more than 40,000 stones. Today, it's a peaceful spot surrounded by the Nile—perfect for a scenic boat ride and a journey into the past.
> 
> To enter the temple complex, sightseers step through a grand gateway that leads to a courtyard lined with towering columns. The main temple is dedicated to Isis, the goddess of magic, motherhood, and protection, and its walls are covered in carvings that tell her story. Smaller chapels and shrines tucked around the site, including ones for Osiris (the Egyptian god of the underworld and brother-husband to Isis) and Horus (the sky deity depicted with a falcon head). Visitors can explore this UNESCO World Heritage Site freely or join a guided tour. At night, a sound-and-light show brings ancient myths to life. The temple's intricate carvings and well-preserved structures provide a fascinating glimpse into Egypt's ancient history.

> Get ready for one of the most dazzling celestial displays of the year—the Perseid meteor shower. Active from mid-July through late August, this year it reaches its spectacular peak on the night of August 12 and into the early hours of August 13. The Perseids light up the skies when Earth passes through a trail of icy and rocky debris left behind by Comet Swift–Tuttle, which last passed close to our planet in 1992. These meteors are called the Perseids because they appear to streak from the direction of the constellation Perseus.
> 
> For those hoping to catch a glimpse of this breathtaking show, the Perseid meteor shower is best viewed from the Northern Hemisphere, extending down to the mid-southern latitudes. One such vantage point is Great Basin National Park in Nevada, seen in today's image, where ancient bristlecone pines stand beneath a sky ablaze with shooting stars. These remarkable trees are the oldest non-clonal species on Earth. Shaped by relentless wind, snow, and rain, they've endured for millennia—witnessing ice ages, volcanic eruptions, and the rise and fall of civilizations.

> Sharks have been around for over 400 million years—outlasting dinosaurs, surviving ice ages, and weathering mass extinctions. They are symbols of ocean health, which is why Shark Awareness Day draws attention to these apex predators that help maintain balance in marine ecosystems. Protecting sharks means preserving the health of entire ocean environments—and ultimately, securing a sustainable future for all life. With many shark species facing the threat of extinction, this day is all about appreciating their ancient legacy and learning how we can help keep them off the endangered list.
> 
> Take the blue shark, featured here, for example—sleek, wide-ranging, and undeniably captivating. It's the only living member of its genus, and it prefers the deep waters of temperate and tropical oceans. While typically a laid-back swimmer, it's capable of sudden bursts of speed when needed. Blue sharks are famous for their epic migrations—some travel from New England to South America, guided by seasonal changes, food availability, and favorable environmental conditions. They give birth to live young and are known for their large litters—ranging from 25 to over 100 pups. After birth, the young head to special nursery zones, far from adult habitats, where they can grow and learn the ways of the sea.

> Do you think rocks are just … well, rocks? These natural mineral combinations have done more than just sit around—they've built the Earth's crust and helped humans shape history. From Stone Age tools to the minerals powering modern civilization, rocks have been essential throughout our journey. International Rock Day celebrates this enduring impact, inviting us to explore the science of rocks, admire their natural beauty, and recognize the rich variety they add to our world.
> 
> If you're wondering where to see geology in action, Iceland is a great place to explore. Today's image takes us to Kálfshamarsvík—a secluded cove on the country's remote Skagi Peninsula. Unlike Iceland's famous black sand beaches, this cove's shore is strewn with large, smooth pebbles, while its fiery volcanic past still reveals itself in the towering cliffs. Here, evidence of volcanic activity is on full display in the form of rare hexagonal basalt columns. These sea cliffs are shaped into natural sculptures so symmetrical that they look almost human-made. These striking formations were created around 2 million years ago, when thick basalt lava cooled slowly, contracting and cracking into geometric shapes that form near-perfect hexagons. Though Iceland is full of volcanic marvels, formations like these are rare, making this quiet cove truly remarkable.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
