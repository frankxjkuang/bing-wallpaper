> As twilight descends on Walakiri Beach on the island of Sumba, Indonesia, the silhouettes of mangrove trees stand like sentinels in the tide—graceful, resilient, and vital. Today, on International Day for the Conservation of the Mangrove Ecosystem, we honor these extraordinary trees and the critical role they play in sustaining life on our planet.
> 
> Mangroves are nature's coastal guardians. With their arching and salt-filtering roots, they thrive where few trees can—anchored in brackish water, enduring tides and shifting sands. They protect shorelines from erosion, buffer communities against storms, and serve as nurseries for countless marine animals. Their tangled root systems not only stabilize sediment but also provide shelter for juvenile fish, crabs, and birds. Mangroves also trap carbon at rates far higher than most forests, making them powerful allies in the fight against climate change. Yet they are disappearing at an alarming rate due to development, pollution, and rising sea levels. Let this day be a call to action. Whether through education, restoration, or advocacy, we all have a role in preserving these vital ecosystems. Because when we protect mangroves, we protect the future.

> If you're eager to explore faraway landscapes this summer, let us take you to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. This vibrant city is one of the capitals and the most populous city in the Canary Islands, an archipelago belonging to Spain. Located on the northeastern coast of the island of Gran Canaria, Las Palmas is home to over 380,000 people and serves as a major port and commercial hub in the Atlantic. The city's distinctive palette of painted buildings—seen here from above—adds striking color to neighborhoods like Risco de San Juan, where homes are built into the hillsides. Founded in 1478, Las Palmas has a layered history shaped by Spanish colonization, maritime trade, and migration. Today, it is known for its subtropical desert climate—with average temperatures ranging from 60°F in winter to 80°F in summer—and for Las Canteras Beach, one of the best urban beaches in Europe.
> 
> Thanks to its proximity to the African continent, this Spanish island offers insight into two cultures: Spanish customs and African traditions combine to form a unique blend in the heart of the volcanic archipelago.

> Remember the cousin who convinced you to climb the tallest tree or the one who helped you sneak an extra slice of cake at the family reunion? Today is a good time to appreciate those childhood partners in crime who made growing up way more exciting. Cousins often land somewhere between sibling and friend, getting into trouble with you, sharing inside jokes, and showing up at every family gathering. In nature, few creatures mirror that kind of togetherness better than the ashy woodswallow, pictured here. Native to South Asia, these birds are rarely seen alone. They gather in tight groups on bare branches or perch atop high places like powerlines. From there, they launch into graceful flights—flapping and gliding as they snatch insects midair.
> 
> Cousins Day may not come with gift guides or special sales, but it is a great reason to drop a text, make a call, or laugh over a shared memory. Cousins aren't just relatives; they're the ones who make family feel like fun. And just like these snug little woodswallows, life's a little warmer when they're close.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In the middle of Rome, Italy, lies an entire country of its own: Vatican City. At just 121 acres, it's the smallest independent nation in the world, yet its reach spans centuries and continents. Home to the pope and the spiritual center of the Roman Catholic Church, this walled enclave is a blend of art, history, and devotion. At its core stands St. Peter's Basilica. Seen in the distance in today's image, this Renaissance masterpiece is built over what is believed to be the tomb of St. Peter, the first bishop of Rome. With its soaring dome dominating the skyline, the basilica is one of the largest churches in the world. Just beyond the basilica lies St. Peter's Square, where thousands gather for papal blessings. The Vatican Museums and the Sistine Chapel, which houses Michelangelo's famed ceiling, are other must-sees. Despite its size, Vatican City has its own postal service, telephone system, and banking system.

> As the sun sets over Badlands National Park, the landscape transforms into a stunning display of color. The national park, located in southwestern South Dakota, features a dramatic terrain of eroded buttes, pinnacles, and spires carved by millennia of wind and water. Spanning over 379 square miles, the park is divided into three main units: the North Unit, home to the visitor center and scenic Badlands Loop Road; and the Stronghold and Palmer Creek units. The park's dramatic terrain is the result of sedimentary rock layers eroding at a rate of about one inch per year, revealing colorful bands of volcanic ash, silt, and clay. These formations are not only visually striking but also rich in fossils, including remains from the Oligocene Epoch (about 33.9 to 23 million years ago), such as ancient horses, camels, and saber-toothed cats.
> 
> Beyond its geology, Badlands National Park protects the largest mixed-grass prairie in the US, supporting wildlife like bison, bighorn sheep, prairie dogs, and the endangered black-footed ferret. Visitors can explore its rugged beauty while also learning about the cultural significance of the land.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Every third week of July, Coral Reef Awareness Week reminds us that beneath the ocean's surface lies a world as rich and complex as any rainforest. Coral reefs—like the staghorn coral pictured here off the coast of Bonaire in the Caribbean Netherlands—are home to roughly 25% of all marine species, despite covering less than 1% of the seafloor. These ecosystems not only support ocean biodiversity but also protect coastlines and drive economies through tourism and fishing.
> 
> But coral reefs are in crisis. Warming oceans, pollution, and overfishing have put over 70% of coral reefs at risk—a figure expected to rise in the coming years. Coral Reef Awareness Week encourages everyone to help—whether by choosing reef-safe sunscreen, joining a beach cleanup, or supporting reef conservation organizations. Every little act counts.

> Every July 20, we celebrate National Moon Day, marking the historic moment when Neil Armstrong first stepped onto the moon in 1969. Uttering the iconic words, 'That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,' Armstrong became the first human to walk on the moon, followed by Buzz Aldrin.
> 
> The moon landing was the result of President John F. Kennedy's bold 1961 goal to send a man to the moon and return him safely before the decade's end. Apollo 11 launched from Kennedy Space Center on July 16, 1969, reaching lunar orbit by July 19. On July 20, the Eagle lunar module touched down, and the world held its breath as history unfolded.
> 
> Moon Day honors not just that first step, but also the science, teamwork, and peaceful international cooperation that made it possible—and continue to drive space exploration today.
