> Penguins are pretty amazing. From their social personalities to their impressive talent for swimming and diving, they're a bird worth celebrating. Today, World Penguin Day, is the perfect time to learn more about these flightless birds, noted for their swimming prowess.
> 
> Native to the land and surrounding waters of Antarctica, Adélie penguins migrate an average of 8,000 miles annually, as they follow the sun from their breeding colonies to winter foraging grounds and back again. The species is easy to recognize by the white rings around their eyes. Oh, and if you think you were chilly this winter, these birds thrive in temperatures as low as -20 degrees Fahrenheit.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This mysterious door can be found in the woods in Germany's largest state, Bavaria, known for its stunning castles, mountains, and forests. The home of Oktoberfest, it also has a worldwide reputation for its beer and its northern region of Franconia, where our picture was taken, is a premier wine destination. This little door leads to an underground cellar near the village of Pünzendorf, and its naturally low temperature once made it an ideal place to store the beer and wine the area is famous for. These days, you might be more likely to find bats inside, so perhaps it's better admired from a distance.

> 'There is no friend as loyal as a book,' Ernest Hemingway once wrote. On World Book Day, we are honoring these loyal friends in the German city of Stuttgart, where a huge monolithic cube is both a modern landmark and home to the city library. Opened in 2011, this striking building was designed by architect Eun Young Yi to be a calming, meditative space in a bustling city. Its interior is white, with splashes of color provided by the books that line its walls.
> 
> World Book Day was set up by UNESCO in 1995 to celebrate recreational reading. It also marks the start of National Library Week here in the US, so there's no better time to head to your local library to find your next great 'friend' to take you on new adventures.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This tiny island fox is a great cheerleader for Earth Day, which celebrates the achievements of the environmental movement. Island foxes exist only on the Channel Islands of Southern California. You can find them on six of the eight islands, and each island's fox is considered a unique subspecies. While numbers have never been huge, they declined catastrophically in the 1990s. Thanks to a recovery program, their population is growing steadily, and these tiny foxes have bounced back from the brink of extinction. If you want to visit Channel Islands National Park to see this success story, today is a good day to go. Admission fees at all national parks will be waived today to mark the start of National Park Week.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Procida is a charming Italian island in the Gulf of Naples, boasting colorful buildings, picturesque streets, and stunning sea views. The island has a rich history, having been settled by the Greeks, Romans, and other civilizations over the centuries, but is less well-known than its larger neighbours, Capri and Ischia. Its oldest fishing village, Marina Corricella, features pastel-colored buildings and narrow streets and is a great place to enjoy fresh seafood and soak up the atmosphere. From there, you can climb up to the fortified medieval village of Terra Murata, built on the island's highest point, which offers panoramic views over the entire Gulf of Naples.
> 
> Procida is home to several beautiful beaches and coves, including Chiaiolella, Spiaggia del Postino, and Ciraccio. And it's popular with film makers too, starring in more than 30 movies including 'The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,' 'The Talented Mr. Ripley,' and 'Il Postino.' In 2022, it was named Italy's Capital of Culture, the first island to be awarded the honor.

> Yes, the water here is as inviting as it looks: clear as glass, the shade of a precious gem, and a perfect 73 degrees every day of the year. Set within a subtropical forest, Juniper Springs is one of Florida's oldest and best-known recreation areas, established in the 1930s as a place to camp, hike, and swim. Long before Disney arrived, natural springs like this one were the big draw in the Sunshine State.

> Florida is home to the largest concentration of freshwater springs in the world, with more than 1,000 popping up where the massive Floridan aquifer breaks through the surface. This underground reservoir hides beneath the entire state, providing Florida with almost all of its drinking water.
> 
> Overextraction and pollution from fertilizers and septic systems have put some springs in peril but in Juniper Springs, these jewel-toned waters are protected by the Ocala National Forest, so it's likely to look like this for a long time.
