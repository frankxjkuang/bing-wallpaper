<summary>Description</summary>

> The ancient monument of Stonehenge has fascinated people for centuries. Estimated to have been built between 3000 and 2000 BCE in the English county of Wiltshire, its large standing stones remain an enigma. Exactly why and how this massive stone circle was built are still debated. What we do know, is that it was done without metal tools or the use of wheels—and some of those stones were moved more than 150 miles.
> 
> On the summer solstice, the longest day of the year, the sun rises directly over the largest stone, the Heel Stone, creating a captivating spectacle. On the winter solstice, the shortest day, the sunset aligns with the stones, casting an enchanting glow upon the ancient site. Stonehenge's precise alignment with astronomical events suggests its importance in ancient ceremonial practices, making it an iconic symbol of human ingenuity and our connection to the cosmos.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Bald eagles are a symbol of strength, determination, and courage. The powerful bird is celebrated every year on June 20, the day it was made the national symbol of the United States in 1782. President Bill Clinton commemorated this date by declaring it American Eagle Day in 1995. The bald eagle, named for its white-feathered head, was once an endangered bird, but conservation efforts and the Endangered Species Act have helped boost its numbers.
> 
> Today's image was taken in the Tongass National Forest in southeast Alaska, which has the highest nesting density of bald eagles in the world. Eagles are picky when it comes to selecting a tree in which to nest. They like tall ones that offer a good view of their surroundings. This majestic bird stands as a proud reminder of the principles of liberty and independence that the nation was founded upon.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Juneteenth is here, a day celebrating the freedom of enslaved African Americans shortly after the end of the Civil War. While Abraham Lincoln's final Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863 freed slaves in Confederate states, certain areas did not abolish slavery until months after Confederate forces surrendered. Texas issued an order on June 19, 1865, that 'all slaves are free.' This act was the origin of Juneteenth, which combines the words June and nineteenth. However, slavery did not fully end in the US until the 13th Amendment was ratified on December 6, 1865.
> 
> The holiday has been recognized in every state since 1979. Modern celebrations and jubilees include concerts, marches, fairs, and buildings lit up with red, black, and green like we see in our photo. Juneteenth offers us the opportunity to celebrate progress while also challenging ourselves to identify the ongoing work that needs to be done.

> Father's Day may appear to go hand in hand with Mother's Day, but this wasn't always the case. It was proposed by Sonora Smart Dodd, who believed fathers should have their own celebration, perhaps motivated by the inaugural Mother's Day of 1908. Father's Day was first celebrated in 1910 and was recognized by President Woodrow Wilson six years later. It fell out of popular practice in the 1920s but eventually regained popularity—partly due to marketing—and was set as a permanent national observance by President Richard Nixon in 1972. Our homepage image today shows a common tern papa, doing his bit for the family—with this species, both parents build the nest and incubate the eggs.

> International Surfing Day promotes the protection of the ocean alongside celebrating the sport itself, every year on the third Saturday in June. People gather for surfing contests, barbeques, beach cleanups, and other activities to help restore the ocean environment. Coming together for a cause is a hallmark of the global surfing community, whether campaigning for cleaner waters or standing together against injustice, as they did at the Paddle Out for Unity gathering in 2020 in Encinitas, California, pictured on our homepage.

> Surfing traces back to 12th-century Polynesia, whose people carried the tradition to Hawaii. The sport made its US debut in 1885 near Santa Cruz, California, when four Hawaiian princes surfed the San Lorenzo River on redwood boards. Today, surfing has expanded around the world.

> Happy World Sea Turtle Day! Today people around the world gather to clean beaches and help animals like this hawksbill sea turtle thrive. The largest populations of hawksbill sea turtles are found in the Caribbean, Indian, and Indo-Pacific Oceans but you'll find sea turtles in every ocean, except the Arctic and Antarctic.

> But these ancient creatures' existence is under threat, with six of the seven recognised species on the cusp of extinction. Climate change, poaching, coastal development and pollution are among threats, along with plastic waste, which can be mistaken for food. From abandoned fishing nets and microplastics to disposable bottles left on hatching grounds, plastics play a prominent part in turtles' present plight. Reducing our plastic waste is one way we can help these magnificent creatures survive.

The park is famous for its firefly season between May and June when these 'lightning bugs' gather to put on a light show as part of a mating display. Today, we celebrate the anniversary of this magnificent national park, as well as Nature Photography Day.
