<summary>Description</summary>

> They might look like spaceships from a retro sci-fi movie, but these strange shapes hovering above the mountains in Patagonia are of earthly origin. These are lenticular clouds, named after their lens-like shape. They form near hills and mountains where moist air is pushed up and over the peaks, cooling as it rises and condensing into water droplets. As wind blows over the mountains it can create a series of waves in the air, and these unusual clouds form in the crest of those waves.
> 
> Today is World Meteorological Day, which marks the establishment of the World Meteorological Organization in 1950. The group shares information between countries so the world can benefit from better understanding and predicting our weather. Thanks to meteorology, we can explain atmospheric phenomena like lenticular clouds. Although, with their unusual shape, they still get mistaken for flying saucers from time to time.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Lake Powell, which meanders across the Utah-Arizona border, was created when the Glen Canyon Dam was built on the Colorado River in the 1960s. It is one of the two largest reservoirs in the US, alongside its downstream neighbor Lake Mead. Together, they provide water to about 40 million people in seven states, while their respective dams generate crucial hydroelectric power.
> 
> But the Colorado River basin has been experiencing its driest period for more than 12 centuries, intensified by climate change. That white line at the base of the canyon walls shows the old high-water mark. Last year, Lake Powell dropped to just over 24% of its full capacity, raising concerns about both water and power supplies.
> 
> Globally, about 2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water. The United Nations created World Water Day in 1993 to highlight the issue and encourage more sustainable water management. As our population increases, it's vital that we all do our part to save precious fresh water.

> Wherever there is light, there is color. It lends liveliness and character to the world around us, but we can also use it strategically to convey particular tones and messages. Blue creates a sense of tranquility, purple gives a sense of luxury, and red can express passion or danger. On International Color Day, organizations around the world meet to discuss research and share knowledge about color theory and its use in the fields of industry, arts, science, and design. As you go about your day, stop and take in the colors around you and think about why they were chosen and how they make you feel. It might just make you consider how you use color in your own life.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Every year around March 20, the sun aligns with the Earth's equator, and day and night are about equal in length. In the Northern Hemisphere, this is called the spring or vernal equinox, and it marks the astronomical exit of winter into the brighter, warmer springtime. From now on, we can enjoy days that are longer than nights. And a sharp eye might spot a flowering crocus, like the ones in today's image, among the first flowers to bloom every year.
> 
> The tilting of Earth on its axis makes the equinox a global event. In Japan, spring equinox is a national holiday called Shunbun no Hi, while in Iranian culture, it is the start of the new year, called Nowruz. However, in the Southern Hemisphere, autumn is just beginning—so send some sweaters to your Argentinian friends.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Barn owls, distinguished by their white heart-shaped faces, are one of the world's most widespread birds, found on every continent except Antarctica. They live in woodlands, farms, and on cliffs, but barn owls also enjoy roosting in places like bell towers and barns—hence the name. They are nighttime predators that fly over open lands to hunt rats and mice. During heavy rain, they are unable to hunt because their feathers aren't waterproof, leaving them vulnerable to starvation during long periods of wet weather. Although some see them as a symbol of wisdom and fortune, their haunting cries and ghostly appearance mean they have often been seen as bad omens in rural areas.

> It would be pretty tough to live on Mars. It's cold, dry, and the conditions are harsh. The planet's average temperature is about –81 degrees Fahrenheit, but it can get as low as –243 at the poles. But with many canyons, extinct volcanoes, and ice caps, it's beautiful to look at from afar. Most photos of the red planet highlight its rusty color, caused by high levels of iron oxide.
> 
> This photo from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is an enhanced-color view of sand dunes and ripples in the Gamboa Crater. 'False color' technology was used to reveal subtle variations of the Martian surface that our eyes wouldn't be able to see on their own. These added details show the effects of wind inside the crater, providing a glimpse of the spectacularly complex features of this planet.

> For St. Patrick's Day, we're enjoying this stunning rainbow over Ireland's southeast coast. Shamrocks, parades, and all things green will be the order of the day as we celebrate the patron saint of the Emerald Isle. While many countries recognize the holiday today, the first celebration was held in Ireland more than 1,000 years ago, remembering the 5th-century missionary and bishop credited with bringing Christianity to the country.
> 
> Our homepage image shows a jewel of Ireland's spectacular southeast coastline, Copper Coast Geopark, a UNESCO site in County Waterford. This magnificent stretch of undulating cliffs and sandy coves is named after the 19th-century copper mines that once operated there. It is dotted with historical sites, including ruined medieval churches, Iron Age forts, and ancient inscribed stones. And, with a little Irish luck, you might just find a pot of gold at the end of that rainbow.
