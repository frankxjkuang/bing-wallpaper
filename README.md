<summary>Description</summary>

> With their twists and turns, record heights, and breathtaking vistas, mountain roads are not for the fainthearted. Pictured here is the historic Splügen Pass, which winds its way through the Lepontine Alps, on the border of Switzerland and Italy. Although its modern version was built between 1818-1823, the Splügen Pass existed in some form as far back as Roman times. At 6,936 feet high, it is one of the highest paved roads in Europe, with 51 marked hairpin bends. It is closed in winter but, if spectacular mountainside views and picturesque lakes tickle your fancy, you can enjoy this ascent between June and mid-October. Have we 'peaked' your interest yet?

<summary>Description</summary>

> The Milky Way has billions of stars; among them, our own sun finds its place. The galaxy's name is derived from the radiant, pale appearance of the band of stars and gas clouds that graces Earth's sky. Methodical observations of the night sky started with early civilizations but astronomy, the oldest natural science, remains a source of fascination today. It's what brings stargazers to Portugal's Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast Natural Park, a site free from heavy light pollution. Now's a good time to seek out your own celestial spectacle, as it is Astronomy Week and the main event, Saturday's Fall Astronomy Day, this year coincides with the autumnal equinox.

> The tiny Cuban tody can only be found on Cuba and its neighboring islands. Despite their colorful plumage, including that sparkling green head, their size can make them hard to spot. However, they are easy to hear. The soft sound of 'pprreeee-pprreeee' or a short 'tot-tot-tot-tot' will tell you there's a tody somewhere nearby.
> 
> The species are found around forests, coasts, dry lowlands, and rivers. The Cuban tody on our homepage is in Alejandro de Humboldt National Park, the Caribbean's biggest and best-preserved forested landscape. The park is also one of the most biologically varied tropical island locations on Earth, with a wide range of endemic plants and animals, so our colorful feathered friend is in good company.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to Oktoberfest, the world's biggest beer festival, held each year in the German city of Munich. Dating back all the way to 1810, it began with the wedding of Crown Prince Ludwig, later Ludwig I of Bavaria, and Princess Therese von Sachsen-Hildburghausen. The celebrations took place on the fields in front of the city gates, which were named Theresienwiese, or Theresa's Meadow, in honor of the bride. The festivities lasted for five days, filled with exciting activities such as parades and horse races. It was so popular that Oktoberfest became an annual event that now draws more than 6 million people. This year's festival starts today and lasts 18 days. Beyond Munich, it has become a popular celebration in multiple countries, and cities inside and outside of Germany imitate the festival and cherish its German traditions.

<summary>Description</summary>

> From early Spanish colonialism to modern day civil rights struggles, the timeline of Hispanic and Latino history in the US is a rich one. Hispanic Heritage Month—September 15 to October 15—is dedicated to the history, culture, and heritage grounded in Latin America. It began as Hispanic Week in 1968 and has since evolved into a 30-day celebration. Why does it start in the middle of the month? September 15 sees the first of a series of independence days in several Latin American countries—El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. They are followed by Mexico, Chile, and Belize, which mark theirs on September 16, 18, and 21, respectively.
> 
> Pictured here are the ruins of the mission church at Quarai in New Mexico, completed in 1632 under the direction of Spanish Franciscan friars. It is one of the three Spanish mission sites that form the Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument. Visiting the ruins is a great way to participate in Hispanic Heritage Month.
