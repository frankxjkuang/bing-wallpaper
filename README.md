> Fall is in the air—officially. The September equinox marks the transition from summer to autumn in the Northern Hemisphere, while in the Southern Hemisphere, spring is just beginning. The term 'equinox,' derived from Latin, means 'equal night.' It marks one of two points during the year when the sun sits directly over the equator, and the Earth receives roughly equal amounts of daylight and darkness.
> 
> To welcome autumn, we're at Buttermere in England's Lake District, where the season's changing colors are reflected in its tranquil waters. Here, a Norse leader, Jarl Buthar, defied Norman conquests during the 12th century. Some believe 'Buttermere' is derived from his name, but as it means 'the lake by the dairy pastures,' it is more likely to be a reference to its rural setting. This picturesque lake offers the perfect place to take a break from the hustle, immerse yourself in autumnal hues, and let nature refresh your spirit.

> Welcome to Ocracoke Island in the Outer Banks of North Carolina. This secluded island, with 16 miles of beaches, can only be reached by ferry or small plane. The Ocracoke Lighthouse, seen in today's image, stands out as a notable landmark. The lighthouse celebrated its 200th anniversary in 2023, making it the oldest continuously operating lighthouse in North Carolina. It boasts an 8,000-candlepower light, which can be seen up to 14 miles offshore.
> 
> Ocracoke Island's history is peppered with tales of pirates, including the infamous Blackbeard, an English pirate who was notorious for his operations in the West Indies and along the Virginia and Carolina coasts. He spent much of his final days on Ocracoke Island until his death in battle with British naval forces in 1718. The island's residents speak the unique 'Hoi Toider' dialect, a blend of Elizabethan English, Irish, and Scottish accents. However, this dialect is slowly fading as younger generations adopt more standard American English.

> Ahoy, mateys! It be International Talk Like a Pirate Day. Today, landlubbers and seafarers alike put on their tricorn hats and hoist the Jolly Roger. The day started in 1995 as a joke between two friends, John Baur and Mark Summers, but it got a boost in 2002 after they shared the idea with humorist Dave Barry, who promoted it in his syndicated column. Since then, it's become a day of fun—people don pirate costumes, engage in pirate-themed activities, like the kid on the ship in today's image, and embrace mock pirate language. Whether ye be a seasoned buccaneer or a greenhorn, it's time to batten down the hatches, shiver your timbers, and unleash your inner pirate. Arr!

> In Japan's Gifu prefecture, Gujō Hachiman Castle stands majestically on Hachiman Mountain. Originally constructed in 1559, this castle has witnessed centuries of Japanese history, including the rise and fall of powerful clans. It was torn down during the tumultuous Meiji Restoration—the period that marked the return of imperial power in the country—but was rebuilt in 1933. The castle seen in today's image is a unique wooden reconstruction, a rarity among Japan's often concrete rebuilt castles. This five-story structure, which includes a museum, offers a glimpse into feudal Japan while providing stunning views of the valley below. In addition to the castle, the city of Gujō is also famous for hosting the Gujō Odori, one of Japan's oldest dance festivals. Held annually from mid-July to early September, the festival sees locals and tourists alike dancing through the night in the castle town, preserving a tradition that dates back more than 400 years.

<summary>Description</summary>

> For many Asian cultures, the point at which the moon reaches its fullest during the harvest season marks the Mid-Autumn Festival, also known as the Moon Festival. It's traditionally observed on the 15th day of the eighth month in the Chinese lunar calendar. Dating back more than 3,000 years to China's Shang Dynasty, this festival celebrates moon watching and the end of the harvest season. During the festivities, mooncakes—round delicacies filled with sweet bean paste, salted egg yolks, or lotus seeds—are often shared among friends and family. Lanterns of different shapes, sizes, and hues, symbolizing good fortune, illuminate the night. Asian communities across the world come together to showcase a mélange of cultural performances, heartfelt renditions of the Moon Festival's poetic tales.

> As depicted in today's image, Gardens by the Bay in Singapore has been transformed into a mystical realm during this event. The Supertree Grove comes alive with radiant lantern displays, and the park's conservatories host themed shows, often inspired by myths or nature's wonders.

> Amid the hues of dawn, captured in today's image, two wallabies stand alert in a field near the Adelaide River in Australia's Northern Territory. These marsupials, smaller cousins of the kangaroo, are native to Australia and New Guinea. There are around 30 species of wallabies, including swamp, rock, and hare-wallabies. These sprightly mammals have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and deliver powerful kicks if threatened. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts in an attempt to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs' for safety and mutual grooming. Their playgrounds are forests that echo with the thudding of their hops as they navigate their home range.

Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
