> Father's Day may appear to go hand in hand with Mother's Day, but this wasn't always the case. It was proposed by Sonora Smart Dodd, who believed fathers should have their own celebration, perhaps motivated by the inaugural Mother's Day of 1908. Father's Day was first celebrated in 1910 and was recognized by President Woodrow Wilson six years later. It fell out of popular practice in the 1920s but eventually regained popularity—partly due to marketing—and was set as a permanent national observance by President Richard Nixon in 1972. Our homepage image today shows a common tern papa, doing his bit for the family—with this species, both parents build the nest and incubate the eggs.

> International Surfing Day promotes the protection of the ocean alongside celebrating the sport itself, every year on the third Saturday in June. People gather for surfing contests, barbeques, beach cleanups, and other activities to help restore the ocean environment. Coming together for a cause is a hallmark of the global surfing community, whether campaigning for cleaner waters or standing together against injustice, as they did at the Paddle Out for Unity gathering in 2020 in Encinitas, California, pictured on our homepage.
> 
> Surfing traces back to 12th-century Polynesia, whose people carried the tradition to Hawaii. The sport made its US debut in 1885 near Santa Cruz, California, when four Hawaiian princes surfed the San Lorenzo River on redwood boards. Today, surfing has expanded around the world.

> Happy World Sea Turtle Day! Today people around the world gather to clean beaches and help animals like this hawksbill sea turtle thrive. The largest populations of hawksbill sea turtles are found in the Caribbean, Indian, and Indo-Pacific Oceans but you'll find sea turtles in every ocean, except the Arctic and Antarctic.
> 
> But these ancient creatures' existence is under threat, with six of the seven recognised species on the cusp of extinction. Climate change, poaching, coastal development and pollution are among threats, along with plastic waste, which can be mistaken for food. From abandoned fishing nets and microplastics to disposable bottles left on hatching grounds, plastics play a prominent part in turtles' present plight. Reducing our plastic waste is one way we can help these magnificent creatures survive.

> Towering trees, rushing streams, and luminous fireflies combine to create this magical landscape in Tennessee's Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The park is famous for its firefly season between May and June when these 'lightning bugs' gather to put on a light show as part of a mating display. Today, we celebrate the anniversary of this magnificent national park, as well as Nature Photography Day. There may be no better subject than the lightning bug to mark the day—as photography is the art of capturing light in lasting images.

> The Stars and Stripes is a symbol that holds different meanings for different Americans. Perhaps that is fitting, given that the flag itself has changed many times. The first version had 13 stripes and 13 stars to symbolize the original colonies that eventually formed the United States of America. On June 14, we commemorate the flag’s adoption at the Second Continental Congress in 1777. Initially, it was rarely seen beyond military and government buildings and ships, but it became an icon of American identity during the Civil War. Today, the Stars and Stripes will fly at Flag Day parades and ceremonies, as the country celebrates its symbolism and history.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The Okefenokee Swamp, on the border of Georgia and Florida, is the largest intact freshwater swamp in the US. Its slow-moving blackwaters are stained by tannins from decaying organic matter and this vast ecosystem, covering 700 square miles, is packed with wildlife. Herons, cranes, bitterns, American alligators, turtles, snakes, frogs, and Florida black bears are among creatures who roam the swamp, which is largely protected by the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge. In the early years of the 20th century, part of the swamp was logged, and its peat deposits were mined for use as fuel. Remnants of railroad lines can still be seen crossing swamp waterways as well as other equipment dating from its time as a logging area.

> Happy birthday, Big Bend National Park! Since this humongous park was established in Texas in 1944, it has welcomed millions of nature lovers and adventure seekers. The park's southern boundary is marked by the Rio Grande, which separates Texas and Mexico. If you look at a map, it's clear how the area got its name. The river has a drastic change in course, bending from southeastern to a northeastern flow around the park's boundaries.

> Big Bend includes many archaeological sites that offer a glimpse of its rich history, from abandoned mines and ghost towns to Indigenous relics from nearly 10,000 years ago. It also offers some of the clearest skies in the US and is recognized as an International Dark Sky Park, making it a popular destination for stargazers. With its huge canyons, desert areas, and forested mountains, it is also a popular destination for adventure sports like hiking, river rafting, and horseback riding.

Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
