<summary>Description</summary>

> An elegant creature for a majestic setting. These whooper swans, gliding on the mirror-like surface of Japan's Lake Kussharo, are close relatives of North America's trumpeter swans. Named for their loud call, whooper swans are one of the world's heaviest flying birds, weighing up to around 30 pounds and boasting wingspans of between 7 and 9 feet. Whooper swans are found across Eurasia and are Finland's national bird, spending their breeding season there before migrating to warmer areas for winter. All that travel doesn't ruin their relationships—these waterfowl form strong, monogamous pairs that can last for life.

> With more than 600 curves and numerous one-lane bridges, it's best not to relax too much while navigating Hawaii's famous Road to Hana. It's hard to stay focused though, as the road winds its way through lush surroundings over 64 miles along the northern coast of Maui, from Kahului to Hana. Make a few stops along the way to get the best views of the rainforests and waterfalls that line the route. Popular attractions include the Waikamoi Ridge Trail, the easily accessible Twin Falls, and the black sands of Wai'ānapanapa State Park.

> Just a few miles north of South Korea's capital city of Seoul, Bukhansan National Park is a retreat for city dwellers and international visitors. Forests and ancient temples sit side-by-side in the park, beneath the three granite peaks of Bukhan Mountain, or Bukhansan. Among the park's ridges and valleys, water deer, wild boar, chipmunks, and squirrels roam freely. A careful ear might pick out the rat-a-tat of woodpeckers or the chirpy melody of songbirds perched in the trees. The park also boasts Bukhansanseong Fortress, whose current structure was completed in 1711.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Ready for a next-level staring contest? Don’t worry, you're unlikely to come face to face with a Eurasian lynx like this one, padding through the snow on our homepage. This elusive predator prowls around the forests of northern Europe and Siberia and the hills and mountains of Central Asia, often unnoticed by humans. Their low calls can be heard by other lynx, and they are primarily active at night, dawn, and dusk, although they can hunt by day if needed. These solitary hunters have keen senses and remarkable agility, able to climb trees and jump more than 6 feet straight up to catch prey. In temperate forests, they mainly dine out on rabbits, hares, marmots, and other small mammals, although they can take on prey as large as deer.

> Up, up, and away! Today is Balloon Ascension Day, celebrating the anniversary of the first manned balloon flight in North America. French aeronaut Jean-Pierre Blanchard's flight took him from Philadelphia to Deptford, New Jersey, back in 1793. Interest in ballooning took off from there and today, hot air balloon festivals take place across the country, including Albuquerque, where today's sunrise image was taken. Every year, hundreds of thousands of people attend the nine-day Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta—the largest hot air balloon festival in the world—to see skilled pilots expertly maneuver their baskets through balloon-filled skies.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
