> The Bahamas comes alive with color, music, and pride today as the nation marks its Independence Day. First recorded by Europeans in 1492 when Christopher Columbus arrived, the islands were initially under Spanish rule. They later came briefly under American control before becoming a British colony. After decades of legal negotiations and a growing push for self-governance, the Bahamas transitioned to full independence on this day in 1973.
> 
> In the lead-up to July 10, Bahamians across the archipelago take part in spirited celebrations, including National Pride Day, ecumenical services, and community walks and runs. These events shine a spotlight on the nation's vibrant culture, heritage, and deep sense of patriotism. And what better backdrop for such festivities than the breathtaking turquoise waters that surround the islands? The shallow, white sandbanks reflect sunlight in a way that gives the ocean its signature electric-blue glow, pictured here. Whether you're snorkeling among coral reefs, watching fireworks from a beachfront, or cruising the Exuma Cays under the golden sun, it seems the ocean sparkles just a little brighter on Independence Day.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Argentina, a nation of sweeping pampas, rich culture, and a bold identity, celebrates its Independence Day today. This pivotal date marks the moment in 1816 when delegates from across the region gathered in the city of San Miguel de Tucumán to declare freedom from Spanish colonial rule. The road to independence was not easy; it followed years of internal struggles and revolutions influenced by global movements, including the American and French revolutions. But the resolve of the Argentine people prevailed.
> 
> Since gaining independence, Argentina has taken important steps in shaping its national identity. The drafting of its first constitution in 1853 established a framework for democratic governance that continues to influence its political system. The country has also made notable contributions to global culture and sports. It has offered the world literary figures like Jorge Luis Borges, a rich culinary tradition centered on asado (a traditional barbecue), and legendary athletes such as Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi. Constitución railway station in Buenos Aires, pictured here, is a historic hub that reflects Argentina's drive for growth, connectivity, and the spirit of unity that emerged during a transformative era.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Italy's Dolomites don't just tower; they enchant, turning every trail into a story. Fondly known as the 'Pale Mountains,' the Dolomites derive their name from dolomite—a carbonate mineral. Set in the northern Italian Alps, the range spans over 345,000 acres and boasts 18 soaring peaks that rise above 9,500 feet. These mountains feature sheer cliffs, lofty walls, and a maze of narrow, winding valleys.
> 
> Amid the dramatic landscape of the Dolomites lies one of its most spectacular peaks, Seceda, featured in today's image. With a height of around 8,200 feet, it offers the highest panoramic viewpoint in Val Gardena, a scenic valley in the province of South Tyrol. A short cable car ride takes you to the summit, bypassing what would otherwise be a strenuous hike. Once at the top, you're greeted by a stunning sweep of the Dolomites' iconic jagged ridgelines. On a clear day, you might even spot Austria's tallest mountain, the Großglockner, located more than 90 miles away.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Graceful, powerful, and impossible to miss—the northern gannet is the largest seabird on the waters of the North Atlantic. It spends most of its time gliding over open seas and returning to land only to breed. These seabirds, known for their vast and noisy breeding colonies, called gannetries, nest on steep cliffs, remote rocky islands, and sea stacks that rise from the ocean.
> 
> Few birds hunt as dramatically as the northern gannet, which dives straight into the sea, as seen in today's image. Spotting prey from heights of up to 100 feet, the bird folds its wings and hits the water at speeds of over 60 mph. Its streamlined body, reinforced skull, and built-in shock absorbers, such as spongy bone plates and air sacs beneath the skin, make these high-impact dives both powerful and safe. Once underwater, the gannet uses its wings and webbed feet to swim after fish, diving as deep as 70 feet and staying submerged for up to 30 seconds. Its forward-facing eyes provide excellent depth perception, while hidden nostrils prevent water from rushing in during those lightning-fast descents.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes, located near Stovepipe Wells Village in Death Valley National Park, are the most accessible and iconic dunes in the park. They are formed by a combination of eroding mountains to the north that supply sand, prevailing winds that move it, and surrounding mountains that trap it from the south—creating a stunning landscape of rippling sand hills. Named after the resilient mesquite trees that grow here, the dunes offer breathtaking views at sunrise and sunset, as well as exceptional stargazing opportunities.
> 
> Death Valley National Park, spanning more than 3.4 million acres, is the largest national park in the contiguous United States. It is known for its extreme temperatures, vast desert landscapes, and geological diversity. More than 93% of the park is designated wilderness, offering opportunities for backcountry exploration, though visitors must be cautious of hazards like extreme heat, flash floods, and wildlife. Despite its harsh environment, the park is rich in natural beauty and cultural history, including its deep ties to the Timbisha Shoshone people, who have lived in the region for generations.

> Every year on July 4, Americans come together to celebrate the birth of our nation. It marks the day in 1776 when the Declaration of Independence was adopted, proclaiming the original 13 colonies' freedom from British rule. From coast to coast, we celebrate with fireworks, BBQs, parades, and patriotic music—and Seattle hosts one of the most dazzling displays in the country.
> 
> Set against the backdrop of Lake Union, Seattle's fireworks light up the night sky, reflecting the city's vibrant mix of history, diversity, and innovation. The most populous city in the Pacific Northwest, Seattle has deep roots—from its Indigenous heritage to its role as the birthplace of grunge to its importance as a technology center. This Fourth of July, whether you're watching with the crowds at Gas Works Park or friends on a rooftop deck, take a moment to reflect on our shared past—and the freedom to honor it together.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
