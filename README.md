> Let's step into a world of giant earthen homes designed to house a village. These 'tulou' structures, built between the 12th and 20th centuries, are the dwellings of the Hakka community in China's mountainous southeastern Fujian region. The homes are constructed from clay, sandy soil, and gray tiles, with bamboo strips serving as the support. They were built to house a whole clan, up to 800 people each. From above, these round dwellings look like giant tires or reels lying on their sides, with light walls, dark roofs, and spacious interiors.
> 
> Historically, these buildings were communal living spaces and defensive zones for Hakka clans. They were built with uniformly sized and shaped family areas, fostering a sense of equality and community. In 2008, UNESCO added Fujian Tulou, which includes 46 of the buildings, to its list of World Heritage Sites, recognizing their unique building tradition. So, if you are longing for a getaway that transcends the ordinary, come to Fujian Tulou!

> Take advantage of the last day of National Park Week! If you haven't had time to take part, we've got your back. Let us take you to Guadalupe Mountains National Park in West Texas. The park, officially established in 1972, covers 86,416 acres. Here, the Guadalupe Mountains rise over the salt dunes of the Chihuahuan Desert and include the highest point in Texas, the 8,751-foot Guadalupe Peak. Pictured on today's homepage is another iconic landmark, El Capitan. Not to be confused with its famous namesake in California, this limestone cliff towers 8,085 feet high and is often used as a waymark for travelers. Even if National Park Week is over, there are plenty of days in the year to visit the country's abundant natural splendor.

> Get your binoculars and field guide and head to a local park, as it's National Go Birding Day! Held on the last Saturday in April, this holiday celebrates birdwatching, an activity enjoyed by millions worldwide. There are approximately 18,000 known bird species around the world. Birds come in a wide range of sizes, colors, and behaviors, making them one of the most diverse groups of animals on Earth—from imposing eagles to today's tiny snowy-winged star, a leucistic Anna's hummingbird in the Australian Garden at the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum. These hummingbirds are typically vibrant in color, but leucism means some have decreased pigmentation, resulting in a paler appearance. Unlike albino birds, these hummingbirds do not have red or pink eyes. Their lighter plumage reduces protective camouflage, making them more vulnerable to predators such as hawks and feral cats.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The first Arbor Day in the US was held in 1872. Since then, the event has really taken root. On the last Friday of April, people across the country mark the occasion by planting trees, often dedicating them to a loved one. It's also a great day to celebrate trees themselves. As well as providing homes for countless species of animals, trees absorb carbon dioxide and clean the air we breathe. They also help to keep cities cooler and can even play a role in preventing floods.
> 
> The amazing tree in today's image is the Tree of Life at Kalaloch Beach on Washington's Pacific coast. Seemingly defying gravity, this large Sitka spruce's roots cling to the sides of a small gully. The soil under the tree is slowly being worn away by a stream that flows into the Pacific Ocean, yet, somehow, the Tree of Life continues to grow. Given its will to live, it's easy to understand how this tree earned its nickname.

> Why fly when you can slide? Happy World Penguin Day! There are 18 species of these flightless birds, 17 of which live in the Southern Hemisphere. Today's Antarctic image stars Adélie penguins, discovered in 1840 by French adventurer Jules Dumont d'Urville, who named them after his wife, Adèle. Despite their small size, Adélie penguins are sleek swimmers and can dive as deep as 575 feet in search of shrimp-like krill or fish. They are social animals that gather in small colonies for foraging, hunting, and protection. While it may seem mischievous, Adélies steal pebbles from nearby nests to strengthen their own, safeguarding their eggs and chicks from Antarctica's harsh conditions and predators.

> Three petals, three leaves, and three stigmas—that's the white trillium for you, whose name derived from the Latin word for 'three.' Native to eastern North America, the spring-blooming species is one of the most common woodland wildflowers. Unlike some impulsive blossoms that burst into color at the slightest hint of warmth, this plant is a slow bloomer. From gracing US postage stamps to being the state wildflower of Ohio and an official symbol of Canada's Ontario, the white trillium is ingrained in our culture. Beyond its aesthetic appeal, the plant has earned its stripes in the world of herbal medicine. So, next time you find yourself wandering through the woodland realm, keep an eye out for this floral gem!

> In the heart of Ireland, amidst the storied halls of the Library of Trinity College Dublin, scrolls and tomes whisper tales of long-gone eras. Today, these silent storytellers shine for World Book Day. Established by UNESCO in 1995, the day serves as a reminder of the importance of reading, publishing, and copyright. But why April 23? It marks the shared death anniversary of William Shakespeare, Miguel de Cervantes, and several other literary greats. From the annual street festival exhibiting authors, poets, and literary organizations in Kensington, Maryland, to the distribution of book vouchers to kids in many countries around the world, this day comes alive with the rustle of turning pages. Interestingly, each year, UNESCO crowns one city as the 'World Book Capital.' The chosen city then carries out activities aimed at promoting reading for the awarded year; this year it is Strasbourg, France. So, have you picked out a book to read yet?
