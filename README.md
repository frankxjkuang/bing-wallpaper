<summary>Description</summary>

> Every day at Grand Canyon National Park tells a story, but February 26 is a special one. It marks the Grand Canyon's designation as a national park in 1919, a milestone that helped protect one of the most iconic natural wonders in the United States. At the heart of it all flows the Colorado River, winding for hundreds of miles through layered stone, quietly shaping the canyon one season at a time.
> 
> For visitors in the area, the anniversary is a perfect chance to slow down and explore. Ranger-led programs and talks highlight the canyon's geology, wildlife, and cultural history. A walk along the South Rim offers sweeping views where California condors circle overhead, while elk, mule deer, and bighorn sheep roam the park's diverse habitats. Stargazing and scenic overlooks add to the experience, especially during winter's clearer nights.
> 
> You don't need to be nearby to take part. The National Park Service provides live webcams from viewpoints across the park, sharing real-time sunrises, weather shifts, and daily rhythms. Whether in Arizona or far away, February 26 is an open invitation to connect with the Grand Canyon in your own way.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Hidden just outside Juneau, Alaska, the Mendenhall Glacier feels almost unreal, inside and out. Step into one of its rare blue ice caves, and the world turns quiet and luminous, with light filtering through centuries-old compacted ice. The glacier stretches about 13 miles from the Juneau Icefield, slowly flowing toward the valley below and reshaping itself year by year.
> 
> Its striking blue color comes from the ice's density, which absorbs most wavelengths of light and leaves behind vivid shades of blue. These caves are fleeting by nature, forming as meltwater carves tunnels through the glacier and disappearing, or collapsing entirely, as conditions shift.
> 
> While reaching the caves has become increasingly rare and unpredictable, the glacier remains closely studied and deeply admired. Over the past century, it has retreated dramatically, offering scientists a visible record of environmental change. Inside these glowing chambers, beauty and fragility meet, creating a powerful reminder of how dynamic and temporary Alaska's frozen landscapes truly are.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Floating lilies, glass-clear pools, and a hidden world below: welcome to the Grand Cenote in Tulum, Mexico. This natural sinkhole formed thousands of years ago when collapsing rock let aquifer waters in. Over time, the chamber filled with clear freshwater that now connects a vast underground system of caves. At first, our eyes rest on the still surface. The water lilies we see in the image float without hurry, their broad leaves catching sunlight while supporting rich ecosystems underneath. These botanical wonders belong to one of the oldest flowering lineages on Earth, dating back more than 125 million years—older than most dinosaurs. Each bloom has evolved clever tricks to attract pollinators—beetles, bees, flies, and even the wind—using scent, shape, and timing to ensure survival in still water.
> 
> As we look closer, the scene comes alive: below, fish weave through submerged roots and turtles glide through leafy shade. Overhead, dragonflies trace arcs while tiny insects spark ripples across the water. Drifting gently among the lilies, we find ourselves surrounded by nature's artistry—where every movement, reflection, and shadow reveals rhythms millions of years in the making.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The great egret is a striking large heron, easily recognizable by its pure white plumage, long neck, and sharp yellow bill. Known for its cosmopolitan distribution, it occupies habitats around the world and adapts well to many aquatic environments. Adults measure about 37 to 41 inches in body length, with a wingspan of 4.3 to 4.8 feet, and weigh about 2.2 pounds, giving them a tall, elegant silhouette—roughly chest‑high when compared to a 6‑foot-tall person. As carnivores, they feed primarily on fish but also take amphibians, insects, small mammals, and occasionally reptiles. Their patient hunting style, standing motionless before striking with sudden precision, is one of their most distinctive traits.
> 
> In today's image, this statuesque bird stands in the snow in Upper Bavaria, Germany, its white feathers blending into the winter landscape. Despite the freezing air, its presence is calm and peaceful, lending an almost contemplative feel to the scene. The egret appears poised and attentive, a quiet sentinel in the stillness of the frozen landscape.

<summary>Description</summary>

> 'Shivering Mountain' is a dramatic nickname, but Mam Tor has earned it over hundreds of years. Rising above Castleton in England's Peak District, it lies within the United Kingdom's first national park, which spans 555 square miles. This landmark takes its name from Old English, 'mam' meaning 'mother,' a nod to the smaller hills it appears to cradle. Yet this 'mother mountain' is famously unstable. Its layers of shale and sandstone have caused landslips for centuries, including a collapse that permanently closed the A625 road in 1979.
> 
> Long before modern engineers battled its shifting slopes, Bronze Age people built a large hillfort on Mam Tor's summit around 3,500 years ago. The ridge still shows traces of a settlement, with roundhouses and ancient trackways that reveal its long‑standing importance.
> 
> Geologically, this 1,696‑foot peak showcases the Peak District's turbulent past. Its cliffs reveal layers formed in tropical seas over 320 million years ago, while nearby caverns—such as Blue John Cavern—hold minerals found in very few places on Earth. Today, Mam Tor remains one of the park's most iconic walks, offering a ridge path that feels both wild and wonderfully accessible.

<summary>Description</summary>

> A red fox standing in the snowfall of Grand Teton National Park is more than a picturesque moment—it offers a glimpse into the resilience of one of North America's most adaptable predators. This small carnivore is instantly recognizable by its sharp gaze and thick, fiery coat that helps it thrive even in Wyoming's harsh winter conditions. Snow muffles sound, yet the animal's extraordinary hearing allows it to detect prey moving beneath the surface. You can almost imagine it pausing amid the drifting flakes, ears rotating, body perfectly still, waiting for the faintest rustle.
> 
> Grand Teton's sweeping valleys and dense forests offer ideal hunting grounds, and winter transforms the landscape into a quiet stage where the fox's movements appear almost theatrical. Its winter fur not only insulates against subzero temperatures but also stands out vividly against the white backdrop, creating the striking contrast often captured in wildlife photography. Seeing a red fox in such conditions highlights the park's rich biodiversity, sharing a reminder that even in the stillness of winter, life in the Tetons remains alert, resourceful, and beautifully wild.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we celebrate the birthday of Ansel Adams, a photographer whose vision helped shape the world's perception of Yosemite National Park. Yosemite is renowned for its granite walls, dramatic waterfalls, and striking light, all of which have inspired generations of artists. One of its most intriguing sights is the Firefall, a term that refers to two distinct events in the park's history. For decades, visitors gathered at Glacier Point to watch an artificial Firefall, in which embers were pushed off the cliff in a glowing stream of fire.
> 
> Far more mysterious is the natural Firefall at Horsetail Fall on El Capitan. On a few evenings in mid- to late February, the sunset hits the waterfall at just the right angle, turning it bright orange, as if molten lava were sliding down the mountain. Clear skies, sufficient water, and perfect timing are all essential for this effect to occur. In 1973, Galen Rowell observed this rare phenomenon and took the first widely known photograph of the natural Firefall—bringing widespread attention to one of Yosemite's most remarkable sights.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
