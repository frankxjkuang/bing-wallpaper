> As National Park Week unfurls its green banners, let's take a stroll down Sparks Lane, a gem situated within the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee. Established in 1934, the park encompasses over 522,419 acres of wilderness. The forests, which cover most of the park, are home to 1,500 species of flowering plants, 952 algae, 65 species of mammals, and over 240 species of birds, making it an International Biosphere Reserve.

> Cades Cove—seen in today's photo—is a valley within the Great Smoky Mountains National Park renowned for its stunning scenery and historic structures, including log cabins, barns, and churches. While exploring the park, you can also visit historical areas like Roaring Fork, Cataloochee, and Elkmont. If you wish to watch fireflies, then Elkmont is the place for you, and if you are a geologist, there's something for you too: this park is home to late Precambrian rocks. So, set your spirit of adventure free and join others to celebrate the timeless American treasure: national parks!

> Get ready to lace up your hiking boots, because National Park Week is upon us! Across the country, America's most stunning landscapes throw their gates wide open, inviting everyone to embrace the great outdoors for free. Throughout the celebration, various programs will be organized by the National Park Service, including ranger-led tours, volunteer opportunities, and educational workshops.

> If you are in Wyoming, you might want to visit Yellowstone National Park, which was the world's first national park. Established in 1872 after the Protection Act was signed by President Ulysses S. Grant, the park is known for its flora, fauna—including Rocky Mountain wolves, and grizzly and black bears—super volcano, and many geothermal features, including the one we see in today's image. The Grand Prismatic Spring is in the Midway Geyser Basin. Its display of colors is caused by microbial mats, multi-layered sheets of microorganisms, ranging from deep blues and greens to fiery oranges and reds. There is so much waiting to be explored out there, so gather your friends, and get out into the wild.

<summary>Description</summary>

> At the heart of the Orkney Islands, an archipelago in northern Scotland, lies an ancient riddle: the Ring of Brodgar. Dating back to sometime between 2500 and 2000 BCE, this Neolithic henge—a type of ancient circular earthwork—and stone circle measure about 340 feet across. Lying on a narrow strip of land between two lochs, the site initially comprised 60 stones, although today only 36 remain. The exact purpose of the structure is still unknown, despite an excavation project at the site in 2008. In 1999, the Heart of Neolithic Orkney group of monuments, which includes the Ring of Brodgar, was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. If you are planning a trip to Scotland, consider walking amid the echoes of history at the Ring of Brodgar while the crisp Scottish air embraces you.

Some of the amazing heritage sites around the world include Machu Picchu in Peru and the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt. The stone structure in today's image is part of the medieval city walls of Ávila in Spain. Built between the 11th and 14th centuries to defend the city against attack, these fortifications stretch for 1.5 miles around Ávila. Nowadays, visitors can walk around sections of the walls, enjoying views of the city and the surrounding countryside.

> Welcome to the world, bear cub! After spending the first months of its life inside the den, this little American black bear may be puzzled by the outside world. The cubs are born between January and February and emerge from their dens in the spring, weighing around 5 pounds. By their first birthday, they can grow to about 80 pounds. However, their weight—which ranges between 100 and 600 pounds for adults—depends on their age, sex, the season, and food available in their area. Black bears are the only bears found in Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, which provides the setting for today's image.

> 'These streets will make you feel brand new, big lights will inspire you.' Alicia Keys sure knows how to serenade the vibrant, bustling life of the Big Apple. Today's homepage image takes us to Union Square in lower Manhattan. At this historic intersection, you can find statues of George Washington—the oldest statue in any park in NYC—and Abraham Lincoln, crafted by the sculptor Henry Kirke Brown. In 1882, workers exercised their rights to free speech and assembly, organizing the first Labor Day parade here. In 1997, Union Square was recognized as a National Historic Landmark due to its importance in US labor history. These days, you're more likely to see street chess players, musicians, skateboarders, dance crews, and vendors of all types in the square.

Let’s ponder these inspirational words by Leonardo da Vinci on World Art Day, April 15, which was also the birthday of the renowned Renaissance artist. From his iconic painting of the Mona Lisa to his detailed sketches of flying machines, Leonardo pushed the boundaries of knowledge and talent in a wide range of fields. Today's homepage shows the RedBall Project at Centraal Station in Antwerp, Belgium. Created by the American artist Kurt Perschke, this traveling public art installation is considered to be the world's longest-running street artwork.
