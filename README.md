> Join us as we celebrate the American wilderness on National Park Service Founders Day. Today we honor the foresight of visionaries who spearheaded the creation of the NPS. This organization was established by President Woodrow Wilson to conserve wildlife, maintain natural landscapes, preserve historical artifacts, and offer educational programs. You can enjoy this day by visiting one of 429 national parks in the country and diving into ranger-led programs, volunteer efforts, and celebratory events to learn more about the history.
> 
> If you're in Montana, you can explore Glacier National Park, which was established in 1910. Glacier has more than 700 lakes, two mountain ranges, and vast forests teeming with life, which earned it the moniker 'Crown of the Continent.' With its 25 glaciers, it is a vital study ground for scientists monitoring climate change. Spread across approximately 1,013,000 acres, the park protects animals such as grizzly bears, moose, elks, and mountain goats. Glacier National Park also houses the Going-to-the-Sun Road, over 700 miles of trails, and the awe-inspiring vistas of Swiftcurrent Lake, seen in today's image.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to Katahdin, where dense woodlands and pristine waterways stretch out as far as the eye can see. Covering nearly 87,500 acres, this new national monument was established eight years ago today. Maine's logging industry was a big part of this region for over a hundred years but declined toward the end of the 19th century. Efforts to preserve its landscape were spearheaded by philanthropist Roxanne Quimby. She started buying land near Baxter State Park in 2001 and donated it to the federal government in 2016, ensuring its preservation for future generations.
> 
> Katahdin Woods and Waters' diverse ecosystem is home to many animals, including moose, black bear, Canada lynx, and bald eagles. Hiking, canoeing, and camping are among popular activities, and it has some of the darkest skies in the country, making it a great place for stargazing.

> Today, let us step into the Phanom Rung Historical Park in Buriram province, Thailand. Here, Khmer architecture and history come to life. Built between the 10th and 13th centuries, this remarkable site served as a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Shiva. It is on the rim of an extinct volcano, offering views of the surrounding paddy fields and the towering Dongrek Mountains of Cambodia in the distance.
> 
> With its earthen terraces, the 500-foot promenade leading up to the main gate is one of the most striking features in the park. A long passage lined with sandstone pillars, it leads to the first of three bridges symbolizing the transition from the mortal realm to the divine. At the top, the shrine showcases a wealth of religious motifs, including Hindu sculptures. The annual festival of Phanom Rung, held in April, attracts many who gather to witness the sun's rays aligning with the 15 doorways of the temple and lighting up the inner sanctum.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The Galápagos Islands in the eastern Pacific are a paradise for wildlife. Habitats range from arid regions to tropical rainforests. Because these islands are so isolated, many of the species that live here are not found anywhere else in the world. One species found in abundance is the Nazca booby, pictured here on Wolf Island. The name might raise a few eyebrows, but it actually comes from the Spanish word 'bobo,' meaning clown, because of the birds' clumsy demeanor when they're walking.
> 
> The Galápagos archipelago, including the remote and rugged outpost of Wolf Island, provides an ideal habitat for these seabirds. The island's steep cliffs and rocky shores offer perfect nesting sites, while the surrounding waters teem with fish, providing ample food. Visiting the Galápagos offers an incredible opportunity to see these birds in their natural habitat, along with the chance to explore one of the most biodiverse regions on the planet.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Mind-blowing beauty is one reason people keep coming back to Wyoming and the Grand Teton National Park. Named 'les trois tétons' by early French trappers, the park was created in 1929 by conservationists including John D. Rockefeller Jr. It is home to a virtually untouched ecosystem of plants and animals, such as grizzly bears, wolves, bison, moose, and bald eagles.
> 
> Just 10 miles south of Yellowstone National Park, the park's 40-mile-long Teton Range is one of North America's youngest mountain ranges. At less than 10 million years old, erosion has not yet had time to smooth the edges of the mountains, hence the Tetons' jagged peaks. Many of the park's lakes, including 15-mile-long Jackson Lake, were carved out by glaciers hundreds of thousands of years ago. Towering over Jackson Hole and reflected in one of its many lakes, the Tetons and the park are a breathtaking sight to behold.

> Established in 1939 to honor Orville Wright's birthday, National Aviation Day kicks off a week-long celebration of America's long history of flight. Pioneers Orville and Wilbur Wright designed, built, and flew the world's first engine-powered airplane near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in 1903. America's love of flight, however, goes all the way back to 1793, when President George Washington watched a hot air balloon launch in Philadelphia.
> 
> Today, let your imagination soar at the Museum of Flight in Seattle. With nearly 200 airplanes and spacecraft, dozens of exhibits, and thousands of artifacts, the museum is the largest independent air and space museum in the world. If you can't get to the museum in person, it has numerous online resources to explore. Feel free to daydream about life among the clouds and stars—your fellow Americans have been doing it for more than 200 years.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
