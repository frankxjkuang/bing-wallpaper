<summary>Description</summary>

> On November 10, 47 years ago, a stark stretch of South Dakota prairie gained recognition as one of America's natural treasures. Badlands National Park, carved by wind and water, was redesignated from national monument to national park status in 1978, securing stronger protection within the National Park System. Its cliffs and spires rise above fossil beds that reveal ancient rhinoceroses, camels, and subtropical seas. Yet the park is not only a window into the past; it also safeguards one of the largest remaining tracts of mixed-grass prairie in the US.
> 
> The prairie hums with life. Bison roam the open range, bighorn sheep climb steep bluffs, and prairie dogs build underground colonies, known as 'towns,' that can stretch for miles. Roberts Prairie Dog Town, where today's image was captured, is the park's largest accessible colony, supporting nearly 200 plant and animal species. Once labeled pests, prairie dogs are now recognized as keystone species, as they give rise to soil aeration and plant diversity. The park's anniversary marks its redesignation, but also reminds us that the Badlands endures not just as a rugged formation, but as a living and breathing prairie.

> The universe hums with creation. Featured here, in the Lagoon Nebula, a cluster called NGC 6530 is kindling newborn stars, a glowing reminder that beginnings are woven into the fabric of the cosmos. About 4,350 light-years away and a few million years old, it is a stellar formation still in its earliest chapter.

> The world celebrates Carl Sagan Day every November 9 to honor the astronomer who shared distant wonders through stories people could understand. Founded in 2009, the day is observed worldwide, marked by lectures, planetarium shows, and stargazing nights that carry Sagan's call for scientific curiosity.
> 
> Carl Sagan's legacy stretches from NASA's Voyager missions and the Golden Record to his Cosmos television series, inspiring millions to see science as both reason and a source of endless possibilities. At Cornell University, home to the Carl Sagan Institute, his vision continues through the search for habitable worlds and the celebration of cosmic discovery. In the night sky, NGC 6530 offers a fitting tribute: a nursery of suns forming within clouds of gas and dust, echoing Sagan's reminder that 'We are made of star stuff.'

<summary>Description</summary>

> Pull off of Highway 101, and Bandon, Oregon, greets you with salty air and the clang of harbor bells. The town began as a small settlement in the 1850s and grew into a center for timber and salmon fishing. Cranberries became a key crop and are still celebrated each September during the Cranberry Festival. Old Town reflects that past with boardwalk cafés and galleries, while the Coquille River Lighthouse stands restored at Bullards Beach as a reminder of the days when its beacon guided ships.
> 
> A short walk from the lighthouse leads to the beach where an evocative coastal landscape unfolds: Bandon's sea stacks, featured in today's image. Sculpted over millennia by waves, wind, and the slow collapse of arches, these formations tell a geologic story. Face Rock resembles the tilted chin of a maiden from local legend. Nearby, Wizard's Hat rises like a pointed cap against the sky, and Elephant Rock arches like a trunk reaching for the tide. Other notable shapes include Coquille Point, Table Rock, and the Cat and Kittens stacks. Protected as part of the Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge, these stones shelter seabirds and reveal the patient force of ocean and time.

<summary>Description</summary>

> What's drawing scientists, travelers, and cameras to Manitoba, Canada, this week? Polar Bear Week is here, and it's more than a date on the calendar. For over a decade, Polar Bears International—a non-profit organization—has invited people to stream live cams and follow daily updates as the bears head to Hudson Bay. It's a week of learning and a call to protect a fragile ecosystem.
> 
> The town of Churchill takes center stage. Each fall, hundreds of polar bears gather near here, waiting for the bay to freeze so they can hunt seals again—their primary food source. Ever wonder how they stay warm? A thick layer of fat and a dense undercoat trap heat. Their tangle-resistant hairs shake dry after swimming, and natural oils stop the coat from freezing. Sadly, warmer temperatures delay that freeze, forcing the bears to fast longer. To cope with the delay, they rest, conserve energy, and sometimes wander the area. Scientists track their movements to learn how migration patterns shift each year. Polar Bear Week celebrates these mammals while reminding us that their future depends on what we do about a warming planet.

<summary>Description</summary>

> What would you wish for if a single lantern could carry your heart's desire skyward? Tonight, in northern Thailand, the Yi Peng festival offers that chance. This centuries-old Lanna tradition celebrates the 12th lunar month with glowing paper lanterns—khom loi—that are released to honor the Buddha. Each lantern is believed to carry away misfortune and light the way toward a brighter future. Children steady the lantern frames, elders whisper blessings, and the crowd pauses as hundreds of lights drift higher than the trees. Farther south, the same full moon watches over Loy Krathong, a sister festival, where candlelit rafts glide across the water.
> 
> One striking place to witness Yi Peng is the temple of Phra That Hariphunchai, Lamphun, as seen in today's image. Its origins date back to 897, when the Hariphunchai king built a stupa to enshrine a strand of the Buddha's hair. That same stupa still stands at the center, with the rest of the complex built around it over centuries. Surrounding halls feature woodwork showcasing generations of craftsmanship. During the festival, the temple becomes a bridge between past and present, joining ancient prayers with quiet hopes in the sky.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Spain's Aragon region isn't exactly famous for its forests—it's more 'sun and scrub' than 'shade and shuffle.' And yet, climb the slopes of Moncayo and you'll walk straight into a twist ending: a dense, whispering beech forest. The mountain is a climate roller coaster. At the bottom? Mediterranean shrubs. Midway up? Oaks and pines. Push further? Suddenly you're in Peña Roya, a beech wonderland that seems to say, 'Surprise, leaf it to me!'
> 
> Fall is their show-off season. The forest becomes a patchwork quilt of red, gold, and orange, while hikers crunch happily through the leaves. Deer tiptoe through the trees, wild boar snuffle in the undergrowth, and birds like Eurasian goshawks and golden eagles supply the soundtrack. And just when you think it's all about trees, Moncayo reminds you of its human side: monasteries tucked into the mountainside, hermitages clinging to rocks, and villages that once treated the forest as their pantry. Today, people come not for timber, but for trails, photos, and that sweet mountain air.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Some bridges connect two sides. Tower Bridge connects history, engineering, and a flair for drama. Standing next to the Tower of London and rising over the River Thames since 1894, this London icon literally knows how to lift spirits—and traffic. With its twin towers, blue-and-white paintwork, and bascules that open like a giant's drawbridge, Tower Bridge is less a traffic solution and more a stage performer.
> 
> When it was first built, London needed a crossing that wouldn't block river trade. The answer? A bridge that could split in half and rise high enough for sailing ships to pass through. Victorian ingenuity powered the hydraulics with steam engines; today, oil and electricity do the heavy lifting. Visitors can step inside to explore its engine rooms and stroll across the high-level glass walkways for a bird's-eye view of the Thames. From its Gothic-style towers to its lifting bascules, the structure continues to bridge the gap between past and present, proving that sometimes, the best way forward is to raise the road.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
