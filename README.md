<summary>Description</summary>

> Though we are nearing the end of Black History Month, the legacy of Black artists stands tall throughout the year. Today we are highlighting the works of Charles McGee, a painter, sculptor, and educator from Detroit, whose works are found all over the Motor City. The 20-foot-tall sculpture seen here, 'United We Stand,' represents themes of togetherness, unity, and balance and sits outside the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History. McGee's pieces, which he produced up until his death in 2021, often feature abstract collections of lines, patterns, and allusions to nature, either in striking black and white or vibrant colors. He is one of many Black artists who have left an indelible mark on the great canvas of American art, along with others such as Joshua Johnson, Edmonia Lewis, Jacob Lawrence, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Kara Walker, and Kehinde Wiley.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In the sun-kissed orchards of the Golden State, almonds reign supreme, enticing the taste buds and adorning the natural surroundings. California grows about 80% of the world's almonds and 100% of those produced commercially in the United States. Almonds have heart-healthy monounsaturated fats and are nutritional powerhouses, packed with fiber, protein, and an array of vitamins and minerals. During February and March, in California's Central Valley, these seeds—not nuts—emerge from the delicate blossoms of the almond tree and mature within a protective, fuzzy hull. The trees, which belong to the rose family, burst into a spectacle of beauty during full bloom, with fragrant flowers painting the orchards in hues of white and pink.

> The 'bathing boxes' on Brighton Beach, Melbourne, beam with a rainbow of colors against golden sands, the ocean, and the city skyline. A popular tourist attraction, they first popped up on Brighton's coastline in 1860, providing somewhere for swimmers to change into their bathing suits. They have been moved, repaired, and added to since then, and while they each have their own distinctive coat of paint, the bathing boxes are built in the same traditional style. Despite facing the threat of removal over the years, these vibrant coast guards remain, adding a splash of color to the beach, and providing their owners with somewhere to sit and enjoy the view.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Fancy witnessing a fiery waterfall? The seemingly impossible can be found at this time of year on the eastern side of El Capitan, Yosemite National Park's famous rock face. Horsetail Fall is a seasonal waterfall that flows only when there has been plenty of snowfall, and when temperatures have been warm enough to melt it. For a couple of weeks in February, if skies are clear, water is flowing, and the sun shines at just the right angle, the long, slender waterfall takes on a glowing, flame-hued appearance. Hundreds gather in Yosemite Valley to see this mesmerizing natural spectacle. The phenomenon has earned the moniker 'firefall,' an homage to the historic Yosemite Firefall, a manmade event from the top of the park's Glacier Point that took place between 1872 to 1968. Eventually, park rangers decided that dumping embers over a cliff onto the land below wasn't the brightest idea.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Within the vast expanse of England's Peak District National Park lies Kinder Scout Nature Reserve, the site of an historic people's protest. At around 2,087 feet, Kinder Scout is the park's highest point and its rugged moorlands and windswept plateaus have drawn walkers and nature enthusiasts for generations. In 1932, it was the stage for a 'mass trespass,' in which hundreds of people on foot protested for public access to these lands. At the time, many areas of open countryside were closed to the British public. This act of civil disobedience prompted much public sympathy, which eventually led to the establishment of the UK's first national parks. The Peak District National Park was the first, designated in April 1951, ensuring that these hills and valleys would be preserved for future generations to enjoy.

The Lincoln Memorial, seen in today's image, overlooks the Reflecting Pool at the west end of the National Mall in Washington, DC.
