> Today, on Shark Awareness Day, let's dive into the ocean's depths to meet our finned friends. It's believed that sharks have been cruising the oceans for at least 420 million years. Today’s homepage shows blacktip reef sharks, hunting in a group in the waters around the Maldives, one of more than 500 species of shark, each uniquely adapted to its habitat. From the graceful hammerhead with its panoramic vision to the fastest species, the sleek mako, shark species are diverse, but a third face extinction. Among threats are unregulated fishing and abandoned nets as well as demand for shark fins. They have a fearsome reputation but are the victims of myths and misconceptions that paint them as mindless killing machines. Today, let's celebrate these magnificent creatures, a key part of healthy marine ecosystems, by advocating for their conservation.

<summary>Description</summary>

> International Rock Day, on July 13, celebrates these hardy heroes, which have played a big part in human history since at least the Stone Age. They served as humanity's first tools and as nature's journals, protecting ancient fossils and documenting changes caused by geological processes.
> 
> Our homepage image shows Zhangye National Geopark's Rainbow Mountains in China, an incredible landscape created over millions of years. Those colorful layers are formed of sedimentary sandstone rock. Iron oxide gave the rock its predominately rusty hue, while other oxides tinted the various layers brown, yellow, and green. Sandstone and minerals that were once layered on top of each other were lifted and distorted by tectonic movement, revealing those colorful stripes. And that is not the end of this geological tale. This unique landscape continues to change, as wind and water erosion sculpts new pillars and ravines. No matter what your favorite category of rock is—metamorphic, sedimentary, or igneous—rocks of every kind helped build the world we live in today.

> On July 11, 1987, the world is thought to have welcomed its 5-billionth person. Thirty-six years later, our population has reached 8 billion and is still rising. World Population Day, established by the UN, is a day to reflect on how much life Earth can sustain, and how our lives impact our environment.

> Pictured here is Hong Kong, a city recognized as one of the world's most densely populated areas, with approximately 17,582 people per square mile. Though Hong Kong has a low birth rate, the density remains high as people live longer thanks to improvements in healthcare, a contributing factor to population increases worldwide. While this colorful night scene might appear glamorous, it is also an example of light pollution, which can disrupt ecosystems and affect our health—one of humanity's many impacts on the world around us.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Delighting the senses with its vibrant hues and fragrant blooms, lavender is thought to have arrived in England with the Romans, around 2,000 years ago. While it’s nice to look at, the Romans likely brought it with them for its many practical uses, including cooking, repelling insects, and as an antiseptic. Many perfumes, modern and historical, have featured lavender, and Queen Elizabeth I is purported to have used lavender scent. You’ll find lavender fields scattered across the country. This one is a typical example, a quintessential summer sight here in the picturesque county of Somerset, in southwest England.
