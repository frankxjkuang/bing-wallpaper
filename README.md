<summary>Description</summary>

> Today, European Day of Parks celebrates the national parks and conservation areas that shape a country's natural identity. Created by the EUROPARC Federation in 1999, this day commemorates the founding of Europe's first national parks—a set of nine parks established in Sweden in 1909. It promotes efforts to protect natural habitats, wildlife, and cultural heritage while encouraging sustainable tourism and outdoor activities.
> 
> Jotunheimen National Park in Norway is a prime example of protected natural landscapes. Established in 1980, it covers over 400 square miles of mountains, glaciers, and deep valleys. It is home to the country's highest peaks, including Galdhøpiggen, the highest in Northern Europe at 8,100 feet. The name 'Jotunheimen' translates to 'Home of the Giants,' a nod to its dramatic terrain and Norse mythology. The park shelters red foxes, Arctic foxes, lemmings, and red deer, while its flora includes hardy alpine species adapted to extreme conditions. The Gjende lake is famous for its striking green color, caused by glacial sediments. Stretching about 11 miles in length and less than a mile at its widest point, the lake sits at around 3,280 feet above sea level. It's the launch point for the famous Besseggen hike—which attracts thousands each year—made famous by Henrik Ibsen's play 'Peer Gynt.'

> No need to hurry, because today marks the 25th anniversary of World Turtle Day. The American Tortoise Rescue (ATR) established World Turtle Day to raise awareness and conservation efforts. ATR has helped rehabilitate, rescue, and rehome thousands of turtles and tortoises, working to protect them and their disappearing habitats.
> 
> Here we see a fascinating phenomenon—a Julia butterfly on the nose of a yellow-spotted river turtle in Ecuador's Amazon River region. Butterflies in the Amazon are known to sip the tears of turtles, which provide a vital source of sodium, a mineral in short supply. The yellow-spotted river turtle is one of the largest river turtles in South America. While these turtles are well-adapted to water, they face a range of threats from humans and a variety of animals. In the 1960s, they were heavily exploited for the American pet trade, leading to strict regulations on their importation. Today, a self-sustaining population exists in the US, with some living over 30 years in captivity.

> Life on Earth, from tiny bacteria to towering trees, is interconnected. International Day for Biological Diversity is about celebrating this web of life that keeps our planet thriving. Biodiversity ties into everything, from sustainable farming and clean water to climate action and disaster preparedness. A decline in biodiversity can increase the spread of zoonotic diseases—those transmitted from animals to humans. In contrast, protecting biodiversity strengthens our ability to prevent and respond to health crises like pandemics. Recognizing its crucial role for current and future generations, the United Nations observes this day each year to raise awareness and foster action for conserving the planet's biological treasures.
> 
> Today's image features Madagascar's Avenue of the Baobabs. In the Menabe region of western Madagascar, Grandidier's baobabs line the unpaved Road No. 8. Also known as giant baobabs, they are the largest and most famous of Madagascar's baobab species. Locally known as renala or reniala (mother of the forest), these trees are remnants of the lush tropical forests that once covered this island country. Now, they stand alone as survivors of widespread deforestation. Though the area was declared a natural monument in 2015, these magnificent trees still face threats from further deforestation, rice field runoff, and seasonal fires.

> Legend says that it began with a single leaf drifting into a pot of boiling water in ancient China. Centuries later, tea is the second-most consumed drink in the world (after water). Today is International Tea Day, a global nod to this timeless beverage, established by the United Nations to recognize tea's role in reducing poverty and supporting sustainable development. It's a day to honor both the drink and the people who are part of this industry.
> 
> Tea harvesting is a delicate craft, rooted in tradition and influenced by geography. From the misty hills of Zhejiang province in China, pictured here, to the rolling estates of Assam in India, the process differs. Green tea leaves are sun-dried or steamed to preserve their freshness, while oolong and black teas undergo oxidation to develop complex, bold flavors. The result is a rich spectrum of taste, color, and aroma. China, India, Kenya, and Sri Lanka lead global tea production. Each country offers its own signature style: China with pu-erh and green teas, India with robust black blends, Kenya with CTC teas, and Sri Lanka with floral Ceylon. In every cup, you can taste the story of its origin, shaped by the land's soil, altitude, and climate.

> Honey bees may be small, but without them, your grocery list would be a lot shorter. No more berries, avocados, or even coffee. Alongside butterflies, bats, and hummingbirds, bees pollinate nearly 90% of the world's wild flowering plants and over 35% of the food crops we rely on. World Bee Day, marked every May 20, honors these vital pollinators and celebrates Anton Janša, a pioneer of modern beekeeping. Janša saw bees as the noblest of insects, an idea now backed by science.
> 
> Unfortunately, bee populations are in danger. Pesticide exposure, habitat loss, and climate change are driving their numbers down, threatening both global food security and biodiversity. The good news is that small actions can make a big difference. Support local beekeepers, plant pollinator-friendly flowers, and avoid chemical pesticides. And the next time you stir honey into your tea, remember the tiny worker behind that golden spoonful and why protecting this buzzing species matters more than ever.

> Drive up Mount Hamilton just east of San Jose, California, and immerse yourself in stunning views and rich history. The 19-mile Mount Hamilton Road is loved by cyclists and motorcyclists for its long climbs and sparse traffic. Built in 1875-76, the road was designed to transport materials to the Lick Observatory, the world's first permanently occupied mountaintop observatory. On a clear day, you can see as far as Yosemite National Park or the Sierra Nevada from the 4,265-foot summit.
> 
> Several rare species are endemic to this area, such as the Hamilton jewelflower and the tule elk. On the slopes of the mountain, you might encounter golden eagle nesting sites. Whether you're drawn to the thrill of the winding road or the views, Mount Hamilton will connect you with nature.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This International Museum Day, let's immerse ourselves in Raoul Dufy's 6,460 square-foot fresco. The 'La Fée Electricité' (The Spirit of Electricity) is housed at the Museum of Modern Art in Paris. This stunning artwork was created for the Pavilion of Light and Electricity at the 1937 International Exhibition of Art and Technology in Modern Life. The painting was inspired by the poem 'On the Nature of Things,' written by Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius. Raoul Dufy's work vividly depicts the evolution of electricity through two main themes: the history of electricity and its applications.
> 
> International Museum Day, celebrated annually on May 18, aims to raise awareness about the importance of museums in cultural exchange, enrichment, and mutual understanding. Since its inception in 1977, the event has grown to include over 37,000 museums across 158 countries. This year's theme, 'The Future of Museums in Rapidly Changing Communities,' invites us to reimagine the role of museums as essential connectors and drivers of innovation.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
