> If the sight of storm clouds gathering over Lake Geneva puts you in a dark mood, then you have an idea of Mary Shelley's frame of mind when she conceived the story that would become her seminal work. While Shelley wrote several historical novels and travel books, it was this macabre story of a grotesque creature that made her legacy.
> 
> Today and every final Friday of October is Frankenstein Friday, a celebration of Shelley's 1818 novel about a doctor who reanimates the dead—a tale of terror that many also think of as the first science fiction novel.  Shelley concocted the concept for 'Frankenstein' (aka 'The Modern Prometheus') at Lake Geneva in the northern Alps on the French-Swiss border. She spent an unusually cold and wet summer there in 1816 with her future husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Lord Byron, both poets. Confined indoors, the group challenged one another to come up with ghost stories. Mary Shelley quickly wrote the short story that would become 'Frankenstein,' inspired in no small part by the gloom and chill of Lake Geneva on one dark and stormy night.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Beneath Venice's Ponte dei Sospiri (Bridge of Sighs) is a popular place to kiss your beloved as a gondolier guides you through the city's canals. But the sighs that the name refers to aren't from staring into your darling's eyes. The enclosed bridge, completed in 1600, connects the Prigioni Nuove (New Prison) to the interrogation rooms in the Doge's Palace, and it is said that a prisoner's last look at beautiful Venice would be from that bridge. And that's reason enough to sigh indeed.

<summary>Description</summary>

> With Halloween around the corner, we present the ghostly image of a Brocken spectre. Despite appearances and the season, there's nothing paranormal about a Brocken spectre. It's the magnified shadow of an observer cast in midair upon a cloud opposite a strong light source. Brocken spectres are rare but climb a mountain at dawn up to the misty slopes and you may be fortunate enough to witness the effect. The spectre, also known as a Brocken bow, mountain spectre, or spectre of the Brocken, can appear anywhere in which conditions are right—like here in the Balkans of Bulgaria. But it's the thick fogs of the Brocken, a peak in the Harz Mountains in Germany, from which the phenomenon draws its name.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Join us for a pre-Halloween trip to a small Italian town about 60 miles northwest of Rome. We're taking you to Bomarzo, where a once-forgotten 16th-century garden holds monstrous sculptures that are meant to evoke anything but pleasure. In our photo, 'The Mouth of Orcus,' a Roman god of the underworld and punisher of broken oaths, gives visitors the feeling of being swallowed into the abyss. During a visit to the Parco dei Mostri (Park of the Monsters), as it's known, you'll come across other grotesque sights such as a dragon being attacked by lions, a giant shredding a man, and Hannibal's elephant snatching a Roman soldier.
> 
> Nearly 500 years after their creation, the grotesque figures still evoke a feeling of horror, perhaps as they were always meant to do. They were commissioned by Bomarzo's Duke Vicino Orsini as a way to cope with his grief upon the death of his wife.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The oil lamps called 'diyas' have been lit for Diwali, the Festival of Lights, in Guwahati, India. Diwali is a five-day celebration of the symbolic victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. Diyas are a traditional symbol of the festival, and they are arranged on a rangoli, a colorful pattern made on the floor using dried rice flour, colored powdered stone, flower petals, or other colorings. Rangoli designs are more than just attractive—they're believed to attract Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth and prosperity. Each day of the festival has its own significance, but day three—called Lakshmi Puja—is considered the main event. To prepare for Lakshmi Puja, people clean their homes to welcome Lakshmi's blessings of prosperity and happiness. A rangoli design is created near the entrance to a home or building, and families pass down traditional designs from generation to generation.
> 
> Diwali is one of the most important festivals of the Hindu faith, though it is also embraced by Sikhs, Jains, and even some Buddhists. Lamps are lit in homes, temples, and markets, and you'll spot hanging lanterns illuminating just about any public space.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The mute swan is a symbol of beauty and elegance, thanks in no small part to the beloved fairy tale 'The Ugly Duckling,' about an awkward and unsightly duckling who upon growing up discovers he is actually a swan. The proverbial story is often used as a lesson in transformation and the relative nature of beauty. One glance at this swan, seen here holding a feather in a nature preserve in the Netherlands, and it's easy to see how the idiom 'graceful as a swan' came about.
> 
> Mute swans are native to Europe and an introduced species in North America. Despite their name, mute swans do make sounds, although they tend to be less vocal than other swan species. The misnomer is also the source of the phrase 'swan song,' which refers to the final act or performance of a long career. Long ago, it was believed that swans sang a beautiful song shortly before their death after a lifetime of silence.

> Since its opening on this day in 1997, the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao is credited with renewing the Spanish city from a gritty industrial backwater into a glitzy travel hotspot—a metamorphosis now described as the 'Bilbao effect.' Cities around the world have been attempting to repeat the formula: Hire a 'starchitect' to put a neglected locale on the cultural map, which will in turn attract more investment, prestigious brands, and tourism. Some attempts have been more successful than others, but there's no denying that Bilbao has long since arrived.
