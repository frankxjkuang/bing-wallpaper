> You are looking at the largest living heron in the world, the goliath heron, waiting for prey to swim by in Kruger National Park, South Africa. This wading bird is often referred to as the giant heron due to its enormous size—reaching as tall as 5 feet in height with up to a 7-foot wingspan. The goliath heron is a solitary creature, known for its slow, hunting-style movements and lives around lakes, swamps, and wetlands. They forage in deep waters and feast on large fish, like mullet and tilapia, as well as small animals including frogs, snakes, and lizards. They are often found in sub-Saharan Africa, with smaller numbers in western and southern regions of Asia.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Perched on a hilltop overlooking the Douro River, the Porto Cathedral is one of the best-known monuments in Porto, Portugal’s second-largest city. Built in the 12th century, this Roman Catholic church has an eclectic architecture style that combines Romanesque and Gothic influences with later Baroque additions. The space inside the cathedral is artfully decorated with blue and white azulejo tiles, which showcase some scenes from the Bible. Tiles like these are found throughout Portuguese cities, on apartment buildings, churches, and public buildings.

> Welcome to Cappadocia, a historical region in Türkiye known for its fantastical landscape. A magical moment to enjoy here is watching dozens of hot air balloons rising into the dawn sky. Every sunrise and sunset gives life to the 'fairy chimneys' of this striking region, mysterious towering rock formations reaching up to 130 feet high. The unusual landscape was formed over millions of years by volcanic eruptions. Another attraction here that you won't see from the air is Derinkuyu, a city dating from 1400 BCE that is completely underground. This subterranean city sheltered citizens from invaders who swept through over the centuries. When you experience the ancient wonders of Cappadocia, it's easier to understand how old the world is.

> Oceans cover more than 70% of the Earth's surface, so it's no surprise they play a crucial role in our planet's climate and ecosystem, supporting a huge amount of marine life. Humpback whales, like the one in our homepage image, can be found in all oceans and have among the world’s longest migrations, traveling thousands of miles from tropical breeding grounds to colder waters in search of food. They are also known for their haunting 'songs.' There are many theories about why they sing, but some research suggests it might be a sign of loneliness. The good news is, that a global ban on commercial whaling has seen their numbers increase, so there is less need for whales to feel lonely.
> 
> However, whales' aquatic environment is still at risk from climate change and human action. World Oceans Day is held on June 8 to remind us that the oceans are crucial for the survival of all life on Earth, producing at least half of all the planet's oxygen and home to most of its biodiversity, upon which we all depend.

> These circular walls belong to Pueblo Bonito, one of the biggest great homes in Chaco Culture National Historical Park, New Mexico. Between around 850 CE and 1250 CE, Chaco Canyon became a major cultural center for the Ancestral Puebloans, who lived in what is now known as the Four Corners region.
> 
> With long winters, little rain, and short growing seasons, the high desert wasn't the easiest place to live but the Pueblo people found ways to thrive here. Today, the park offers a glimpse into an ancient culture's traditions and way of life. The site is home to remnants of prehistoric ceremonial and massive stone buildings, called great houses. Pueblo Bonito, pictured on our homepage, took decades to build and stood four or five stories tall with more than 600 rooms. It would have been used for ceremonies, commerce, astronomy, hospitality, and more. Eventually, Chaco's influence declined, and the people moved on. These ruins are a window onto its glorious past, at the heart of an ancient civilization.

<summary>Description</summary>

> On June 6, 1944, after months of planning, Allied forces descended on the beaches of Normandy, France, for the start of one of the most ambitious military attacks in history. Codenamed Operation Overlord, the Battle of Normandy was an operation to free Western Europe from Nazi occupation during World War II. This military action would play a pivotal role in the Allies' win against the Axis powers.
> 
> Today's Normandy is a far cry from the battlefields of war. This beautiful region draws travelers from around the world, who feast their eyes on landscapes that inspired the great Impressionist painters, while sampling the famous local cheese, Camembert. However, blunt physical reminders of the past remain scattered about the region, a lasting reminder of the thousands of lives lost during the D-Day operation.

> 'To damage the Earth is to damage your children,' as the writer and environmentalist Wendell Berry put it. Today is World Environment Day, which marks its 50th year of raising awareness and encouraging action to protect the natural world. This year's theme is about finding solutions to plastic pollution, which brings us to our homepage image.
> 
> The colorful collection of assembled objects in this picture is just a small section of an art installation named 'Priscilla the Parrotfish.' Like other sculptures by the Washed Ashore environmental project, Priscilla was constructed from plastic litter found on Oregon's beaches. While striking to look at, the sculpture reminds us that more than 8 million tons of plastic are estimated to be dumped in the ocean each year, harming marine life. This year's World Environment Day urges an end to the flow of waste, by changing the way we produce, use, and dispose of plastic.
