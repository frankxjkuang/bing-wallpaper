> In today's image, we see the sun disappearing below the pier at Huntington Beach, California. First built in 1902, the pier was damaged by a storm and had to be rebuilt just nine years later. During World War II, a submarine lookout post was installed on the pier to help with the war effort. These days, it's a popular spot for fishing and watching surfers ride the waves out in the Pacific Ocean.
> 
> Huntington Beach has been nicknamed Surf City, and it's not hard to see why. Its 9.5-mile-long sandy beach gets great waves all year round. And it is home to the International Surf Museum, where visitors can learn about the history of the sport and see historic surfboards. Whether you're hitting the waves or watching from the pier, Huntington Beach is a peerless destination.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The lighthouse featured in today's image stands in southern Portugal's popular Algarve region. Built in 1919, Alfanzina Lighthouse helps ships navigate dangerous waters near the town of Carvoeiro. A popular tourist destination, the lighthouse also has become a symbol of the region's deep links to the sea. If you're lucky enough to live near a lighthouse, this weekend is the perfect time to pay it a visit.
> 
> Today marks the start of International Lighthouse and Lightship Weekend, celebrating this vital maritime infrastructure. Originally, lighthouses were powered by fires and oil lamps, requiring lighthouse keepers to maintain them. These days, however, most lighthouses have been automated and installed with electric light sources. In waters that are too deep or otherwise unsuitable to build a lighthouse, lightships—moored vessels outfitted with beacon lights—have often been used.

> From single rails to virtual reality, roller coasters have been thrilling people for centuries. Their origins can be traced back to 17th-century Russia, where wooden slides—'Russian Mountains'—provided seasonal entertainment. The first roller coaster was built in early 19th-century Paris, France. Called 'Les Montagnes Russes à Belleville,' it featured wheeled carts securely attached to tracks. By the 1900s, coasters were looping the loop for the first time.
> 
> Pictured here is a hybrid coaster that combines wood and steel—Hakugei, the White Whale of Japan in Nagashima Spa Land. Once known as White Cyclone, this beast underwent a transformation in 2019. The ride's wooden track was replaced with steel. Its metamorphosis not only revved up its velocity and propelled it to new heights but also introduced gravity-defying inversions. So, if you find yourself in Japan, brave the Hakugei—buckle up and take the plunge, and emerge with a tale as epic as the ride itself.

> In 1991, logger Hồ Khanh stumbled upon something big in what is now Vietnam's Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park. During a jungle expedition, he found the entrance to a cave with a roaring underground river. It was later named Hang Sơn Đoòng, or 'cave of the mountain river' and in 2009, the British Cave Research Association led an expedition to explore it. They realized something incredible: It was the world's largest cave. Hang Sơn Đoòng's main passage is 3.1 miles long, 490 feet wide, and 660 feet high. That's tall enough to fit a 40-story skyscraper.
> 
> Inside the cave, there is a 200-foot calcite barrier called the 'Great Wall of Vietnam' and stalagmites stretching as tall as 260 feet. It even has its own weather system; clouds form inside due to temperature differences between the cave air and the outside air. Moreover, an underground river links Hang Sơn Đoòng to the nearby Hang Thung cave, suggesting undiscovered depths. Given its fragile ecosystem, strict regulations are in place to preserve Hang Sơn Đoòng's pristine condition. Tours of the cave are limited to 1,000 visitors per year.

> From mythology to movies, lizards have often been portrayed as scary reptiles. But they're not as dangerous as stories might lead you to believe. World Lizard Day is the perfect time to learn about these cold-blooded creatures. With more than 7,000 species, lizards have adapted to a wide range of environments—from deserts to rainforests. Take geckos—these little climbers have toe pads that let them scale walls and walk on ceilings. Then there are chameleons with their color-changing skin. While many think it's all about blending in, this ability is also used to communicate and regulate temperature.
> 
> Now let's focus on the peculiar creature in today's image, trekking across the arid landscape of Australia's Watarrka National Park. Meet the thorny devil, also known as the thorny dragon or moloch. With clever hydrophilic skin that channels moisture to its mouth, this reptile can hydrate just from the dew on its body. This allows it to thrive in extreme desert conditions where others would perish. On World Lizard Day, let's take a moment to appreciate these scaly wonders of the animal kingdom.

> Get ready to celebrate elephants, the largest living land animals. There are three elephant species alive today: African bush, African forest, and Asian. All three species are endangered, and World Elephant Day is dedicated to highlighting the challenges they face, like the ivory trade and habitat loss.
> 
> Today's image features a herd of African elephants roaming the vast expanses of Amboseli National Park in Kenya. Elephants live in groups made up of several families led by a matriarch, an older female elephant, while males leave to live alone or in bachelor herds.
> 
> Thanks to conservation work and the support of the Maasai people, Amboseli is one of the best places in Africa to view large herds, against the dramatic backdrop of Mount Kilimanjaro.
