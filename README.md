<summary>Description</summary>

> At 8 miles in circumference, the Chittorgarh Fort is one of the largest forts in India, a nation with scores of ancient and medieval fortresses. For starters there are seven massive gates from which to enter. Inside you'll find four palaces and 19 temples. At one time there were almost 100 bodies of water, most of them ponds fed by natural catchment and rainfall, although now there are only 20. Chittorgarh ('garh' means 'fort,' so it's also known as Chittor Fort) is so old, no one is sure exactly when it was built, although reports of its earliest capture go back to the 8th century. It is one of six large forts in the northwestern state of Rajasthan referred to as the Hill Forts of Rajasthan, all of them collectively designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. We're featuring this important and ancient complex on India's 75th Independence Day, one of India's three national holidays.
> 
> On August 15, 1947, India officially broke free of Great Britain and became a sovereign and democratic nation with the speedy passage of the Indian Independence Act. The paperwork might have been fast, but the struggle for independence from British rule lasted 90 years and cost many Indian lives. The British controlled the Indian subcontinent for nearly 200 years, after winning the decisive Battle of Plassey in 1757. The victory allowed the English East India Company to eventually exercise control over most of the rest of the Indian subcontinent, Burma, and Afghanistan. East India remained the supreme authority in India for a century until 1857 when a massive rebellion by civilians and Indian soldiers against the company was suppressed, resulting in direct British rule, referred to as the British raj.
> 
> The ensuing decades saw the formation of the Indian National Congress, the rise of Indian nationalism, various armed rebellions, and many acts of civil disobedience led by Mahatma Gandhi and others, before independence was finally achieved. While India as we know it is still a very young nation, the Chittor Fort reminds us the land and people that created modern India have endured and thrived for millennia.

> Do you hold a warm spot in your heart for these cold-blooded creatures? Lizard lovers celebrate the scaly squamates on this day each year. This camouflaged panther chameleon is one of a multitude of lizards that inhabit the island of Madagascar, many of which are found nowhere else. More than 50% of chameleon species are found only on the island, including the world's smallest known chameleon, the recently discovered Brookesia nana, which is smaller than your fingernail.
> 
> There are more than 5,000 species of lizards around the world, and they live on every continent except Antarctica. The individual species have developed adaptations for survival as varied as their environments. Chameleons and geckos camouflage themselves so well they can seem to almost disappear. Many lizards will detach their tails, a technique called tail autonomy, to distract predators while they escape. The frilled-neck lizard fools would-be predators by spreading out a large frill around its neck, making itself look large and scary. And the world's largest living lizards, Komodo dragons, can reach 10 feet long—they're so big that deer are their main prey.

> In the mood for a quiet canoe ride? If so, consider a trip to Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) in northeast Minnesota. The Boundary Waters wilderness stretches for 150 miles along the US-Canada border within Superior National Forest. Known by those seeking solitude, Boundary Waters is one of America's most beautiful and remote locations. Formed long ago from the scraping and gouging of glaciers, the area is distinct with its rugged cliffs, canyons, and thousands of lakes and streams. More than 1,200 miles of canoe routes are enjoyed by thousands of people every year.
> 
> Canoeing the many waterways may be the main draw, but 80% of the area is forest. In fact, the Boundary Waters wilderness contains the largest swath of uncut forest in the eastern US. That's even after the 1999 'Boundary Waters blowdown,' a powerful July 4 derecho storm that lasted 22 hours and took down millions of trees with its 100-mph winds. Many animals call the forest home, including the largest population of wolves in the contiguous states.
> 
> If you're a night owl, the Boundary Waters wilderness offers a unique opportunity. In 2020, the area was designated one of only 15 Dark Sky Sanctuaries around the world by the International Dark-Sky Association. This differs from a normal Dark Sky designation in that its fragile landscape is one of the planet's most remote locations, free of light pollution and ideal for night sky observation. The point is, night or day, you're sure to find something worth your time at the Boundary Waters.

> Today is World Elephant Day, when we focus on these remarkable creatures and pledge to protect them. African elephants, like those shown here, are the largest living land animals, with bull elephants standing a whopping 13 feet tall at the shoulder. Their distinctive trunks and big, flapping ears make them one of the first animals every child can recognize. Adults marvel at the close family bonds they create and the way a herd rallies to protect its members, grieving when one dies. They form a strong, social community over their life span of about 60 to 75 years.
> 
> Sadly, elephants attract negative attention too. Around 100 of the massive African elephants are killed by poachers every day, their tusks stolen for the lucrative and illegal ivory trade. In fact, the most recent comprehensive census of African elephants shows their populations decreased by 62% between 2002 and 2011, and they have lost 30% of their geographical range, according to the World Wildlife Fund. And this decline continues—it's feared that elephants could be headed to extinction by the end of the next decade. Wildlife biologist Dr. Jane Goodall has studied and written about elephants: 'I have spent hours and hours watching elephants,' she says, 'and come to understand what emotional creatures they are…. It's not just a species facing extinction, it's massive individual suffering.'
> 
> The elephant family pictured here lives in Amboseli National Park in Kenya, home to more than 1,500 African elephants. The park is also home to the Amboseli Elephant Research Project, which has studied, observed, and protected African elephants for 50 years. This World Elephant Day, let's all find a way to help these majestic beasts and guarantee them a safe, happy future in the wild.

> It makes a mountain of sense for Japan to celebrate Mountain Day, which occurs each August 11. First celebrated in 2016, it's Japan's newest holiday. Nearly three-quarters of the country is made up of mountains, thanks to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire volcanic zone. Japan's four major islands—Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku—all have ranges running through them.
> 
> The 9,065-foot Mount Tsubakuro, which we feature in our home page image today, is a popular hiking destination on Honshu with well-maintained trails, rest areas, and lodges. Beautiful scenery abounds here, less than three hours' drive from Tokyo.
> 
> According to the legislation that established Mountain Day, the observance was launched to provide 'opportunities to get familiar with mountains and appreciate blessings from mountains.' One of those is snow-capped Mount Fuji, Japan's tallest mountain (12,389 feet) and one of the most pictured peaks in the world. Japan's rugged terrain is a boon for its tourist industry, with plenty of spots to ski and climb—or just relax in ancient hot springs.

<summary>Description</summary>

> These immensely photogenic and relatable trees, their shaggy, sinewy limbs thrust upward into the pale light of the desert sky, are the main reason people come here to California's Joshua Tree National Park. Joshua Tree was declared a national monument on August 10, 1936, before being designated a national park in 1994. Perhaps no other national park is so completely defined by a single feature, be it a plant or wildlife or natural formation. While Joshua Tree National Park contains other wonders, this tree that looks drawn by Dr. Seuss is what visitors come to celebrate.
> 
> The park (and the town of the same name) could also be called the hippest national park in the country, owing to its proximity to Los Angeles, and the Insta-worthy, charismatic flora that have helped make JT a darling on social media. Vanlifers, artists, celebrities, and other creative bohemians have fueled a boom in tourism, not just to the park itself, but to the surrounding towns, like Pioneertown. The kitschy outpost served as an old Hollywood set and is now a center of nightlife in the area. Pappy & Harriet's Pioneertown Palace serves artisanal cocktails with its barbecue and features live music, sometimes from the likes of Paul McCartney, Robert Plant, and Patti Smith. And if you can't find an elderflower martini in Joshua Tree, then Palm Springs and Indio and Coachella are a short drive away, something Yellowstone and Yosemite can't claim.
> 
> But for those going purely for the nature—the hikers, rock climbers, campers, and stargazers—the 1,200-square-mile park is no less a marvel. Two deserts, the high-elevation Mojave and the low-elevation Colorado, merge here, each with its own ecosystem. The Joshua tree itself grows only on the Mojave side, at elevations between 1,300 and 5,900 feet. Most of the world's Joshua trees are found here. A variety of yucca, Joshua trees live from 500 to 1,000 years with roots as deep as 35 feet. Most believe their name was first concocted by Mormon pioneers who likened their branches to the outstretched arms of the biblical Joshua. It proved catchier than its botanical name, Yucca brevifolia. And as any influencer worth their followers will tell you, it makes for a much more memorable hashtag.

<summary>Description</summary>

> What at first glance appears to be graffiti tagged on a rock wall is, in fact, artwork created by the first human settlers of this remote region deep in Argentine Patagonia. It's thought that the cave paintings were made between 13,000 and 9,500 years ago. The archaeological site is known in Spanish as the Cueva de las Manos (Cave of the Hands). It's the largest display of prehistoric handprints in the world, made all those years ago by people holding a hand against the rock wall and blowing pigments through tubes made of bone. Of the 829 black, white, red, and ochre prints, most are of young male hands. One print has six fingers, and only 31 are of right hands.
> 
> The cave paintings were created in at least three waves over thousands of years by ancestors of the Tehuelche people. Archaeologists have hypothesized that the artists were hunter-gatherers. This theory is supported by the fact that even older than the handprints are depictions of guanacos (a relative of the llama, and the main source of food at the time), rheas (large flightless birds), and hunting scenes.
> 
> Today, more than 476 million Indigenous people live in various regions of the world, like the Teheulche, who continue to live in Patagonia near the southern border between Argentina and Chile. To honor and protect the rights of the world's current Indigenous populations, the UN marks each August 9 as International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples. We'll raise our hands in support of that.
