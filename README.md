> Autumn has officially begun! In the Northern Hemisphere, the autumnal equinox falls on September 23 this year, marking the beginning of autumn. Today is one of the two moments in the year when day and night are equal in length, thanks to the sun's location exactly above the equator. In the Southern Hemisphere, today marks the vernal equinox and they are heading into spring.
> 
> Camouflaged in autumn colors, the cottonwood tree in today's image might be playing peek-a-boo among the red sandstones of Coyote Gulch in southern Utah. Here in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, the canyon is painted orange by oxidizing water and other fluids, as well as iron-filled minerals.

> Keep the five alive! That is the mission of World Rhinoceros Day, rhino specialists, and fans around the globe. Those five species are: the Javan, Sumatran, greater one-horned, black, and white rhinoceros. It is the white rhino which can be seen on our homepage, identified by its two horns and square lip.
> 
> The wild rhino population globally is estimated to be under 27,000—less than the average capacity at a Major League Baseball stadium. While there have been conservation successes, ensuring these amazing animals survive is a continuing challenge. Habitat loss is one threat, but rhinos are particularly targeted by poachers for their horns. Parks like the Shamwari Game Reserve in South Africa, pictured above, employ anti-poaching squads to keep these rhinos safe.

<summary>Description</summary>

> With their twists and turns, record heights, and breathtaking vistas, mountain roads are not for the fainthearted. Pictured here is the historic Splügen Pass, which winds its way through the Lepontine Alps, on the border of Switzerland and Italy. Although its modern version was built between 1818-1823, the Splügen Pass existed in some form as far back as Roman times. At 6,936 feet high, it is one of the highest paved roads in Europe, with 51 marked hairpin bends. It is closed in winter but, if spectacular mountainside views and picturesque lakes tickle your fancy, you can enjoy this ascent between June and mid-October. Have we 'peaked' your interest yet?

<summary>Description</summary>

> The Milky Way has billions of stars; among them, our own sun finds its place. The galaxy's name is derived from the radiant, pale appearance of the band of stars and gas clouds that graces Earth's sky. Methodical observations of the night sky started with early civilizations but astronomy, the oldest natural science, remains a source of fascination today. It's what brings stargazers to Portugal's Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast Natural Park, a site free from heavy light pollution. Now's a good time to seek out your own celestial spectacle, as it is Astronomy Week and the main event, Saturday's Fall Astronomy Day, this year coincides with the autumnal equinox.

> The tiny Cuban tody can only be found on Cuba and its neighboring islands. Despite their colorful plumage, including that sparkling green head, their size can make them hard to spot. However, they are easy to hear. The soft sound of 'pprreeee-pprreeee' or a short 'tot-tot-tot-tot' will tell you there's a tody somewhere nearby.
> 
> The species are found around forests, coasts, dry lowlands, and rivers. The Cuban tody on our homepage is in Alejandro de Humboldt National Park, the Caribbean's biggest and best-preserved forested landscape. The park is also one of the most biologically varied tropical island locations on Earth, with a wide range of endemic plants and animals, so our colorful feathered friend is in good company.
