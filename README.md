<summary>Description</summary>

> On Earth Day, let's journey to one of nature's most stunning displays of geothermal power—Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. The largest hot spring in the US, it spans 370 feet across and reaches temperatures of 160°F. This geothermal marvel is fueled by the immense heat of the massive Yellowstone volcano beneath the surface. Its vivid rings of blue, green, yellow, and orange are created by heat-loving microorganisms—called thermophiles—that thrive in the mineral-rich waters.
> 
> Yellowstone's geothermal activity not only fuels its geysers and hot springs, but also demonstrates a model for sustainable energy. Unlike fossil fuels, geothermal energy provides a continuous and renewable energy source. As we celebrate Earth Day, the theme 'Our Power, Our Planet' highlights the need for cleaner energy solutions. Yellowstone National Park's geothermal forces showcase Earth's untapped potential—one that could help reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change. The Grand Prismatic Spring serves as a reminder that our planet holds immense power. The challenge is using it wisely for a sustainable future.

> Imagine standing under a sky so dark that the Milky Way stretches across it like a luminous ribbon. This is the experience that International Dark Sky Week aims to bring back. Every April, during the week of the new moon (this year from April 21 to 27), we are invited to turn off our lights and gaze at the stars. The event was initiated by Jennifer Barlow, a high school student in 2003, to combat light pollution. One of the best places to experience the night sky's beauty is Joshua Tree National Park in southeastern California, an International Dark Sky Park. Here, the absence of artificial light allows visitors to see the stars as our ancestors once did. Did you know that light pollution prevents us from seeing most of the stars in the Milky Way? By reducing it, we can reconnect with the universe's beauty and wonder.

> Today is a special day for billions of Christians worldwide—a time of renewal, celebration, and traditions. Easter, also called Pascha or Resurrection Sunday, commemorates the resurrection of Jesus Christ as described in the New Testament. It's also a time for festive traditions, from sunrise services to Easter egg hunts and, of course, the beloved Easter Bunny.
> 
> The origins of the Easter Bunny are unclear, but historians believe German settlers introduced the tradition to America in the 1700s. In German folklore, an egg-laying hare called 'Osterhase' visited children and left behind decorated eggs representing good fortune and new beginnings. Over time, this tradition evolved into Easter baskets filled with chocolates, jellybeans, and marshmallows. Whether you're enjoying a festive feast, decorating eggs, or simply soaking in the beauty of spring, may your Easter be filled with joy and love!

> Get your hiking boots on—it's National Park Week! This nine-day-long event encourages people to explore and appreciate the natural beauty and cultural heritage of our national parks. It's an excellent time to learn about these protected areas, participate in preservation efforts, and enjoy their scenic views. You can join in by visiting a national park, sharing information about these natural treasures, and appreciating the vital role they play in our country's heritage.
> 
> Zion National Park—seen in today's image—is a great place to start. Located in southwestern Utah, the park's 232 square miles are adorned with stunning sandstone cliffs and narrow slot canyons. Zion's plant and animal life are diverse and include nearly 300 bird species and 19 species of bats.

> Imagine a world without the pyramids, the Great Wall, or ancient cave cities—hard to picture, right? That's why April 18 is the International Day for Monuments and Sites, an event recognized by UNESCO dedicated to protecting cultural treasures worldwide. This day is all about celebrating our history, raising awareness about endangered sites, and making sure future generations can enjoy them too.
> 
> A remarkable example is Göreme Historical National Park in Cappadocia, Türkiye. It's famous for its 'fairy chimneys'—towering rock formations shaped by volcanic ash and erosion over thousands of years. People carved homes, churches, and entire underground cities into these soft rock formations, some dating back to the 4th century. Today, it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting visitors from around the world. Whether it's ancient castles, temples, or hidden underground cities, this day reminds us to appreciate and protect the landmarks that tell the story of humanity.

> If fashion had a bird ambassador, the cock-of-the-rock would steal the spotlight. The males look like they're wearing a bright orange-red costume, complete with a huge crest that almost covers their beak. With its bold colors, this native South American bird isn't just about looks—it's got the moves too. The Andean and Guianan cock-of-the-rock are renowned for their theatrical courtship dances, making them true head-turners of the feathered kingdom. Females are far less flashy, with brownish feathers that help them stay hidden. During the mating season, males gather in leks—noisy display arenas—where they hop, squawk, and shake their heads in an effort to impress a female. She watches, picks the best dancer, mates, and then flies off to build a concave, cup-shaped mud nest on a rocky surface.
> 
> The female typically lays two white eggs and incubates them for 25 to 28 days, raising the chicks on her own. The Andean cock-of-the-rock thrives in the cloud forests of the Andes, favoring dense, fruit-rich areas in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. As a frugivore, it primarily eats fruit and helps spread seeds throughout its habitat. It occasionally consumes insects and small vertebrates.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Within the remote canyons of southeastern Utah, Natural Bridges National Monument highlights the power of erosion and the passage of time. Shaped by the relentless forces of wind and water, this monument features three magnificent natural bridges—Sipapu, Kachina, and Owachomo. These bridges were named to honor the Ancestral Puebloans who once lived here. Sipapu is the largest bridge, with a massive opening that could almost fit the dome of the United States Capitol. Kachina, pictured here, is equidistant from Sipapu and Owachomo. It was named after the petroglyphs and pictographs found at its base. Owachomo is believed to be the oldest of the three. Its thin, arching structure suggests it may eventually collapse.
> 
> Recognizing the significance of these natural wonders, President Theodore Roosevelt designated Natural Bridges as Utah's first national monument on this day in 1908. Today, it remains a place of awe and solitude, where visitors can hike beneath the soaring bridges, gaze at some of the darkest night skies in the country, and step back into a landscape sculpted over millions of years.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
