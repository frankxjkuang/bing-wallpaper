> As the first day of May dawns in Hawaii, Lei Day bursts forth in a riot of color, fragrance, and festivity. Leis are garlands crafted from flowers, leaves, and even shells, carrying significant cultural importance in Hawaiian culture. Leis were brought by the Polynesians as they migrated eastward through the Pacific Islands before reaching Hawaii between 1000 and 1200 CE. They represent love, respect, and the ever-present aloha spirit, described as 'the coordination of mind and heart within each person.' Lei Day is an all-day fiesta that includes parades, pageants, lei-making contests, hula dances, and feasts. It also marks the beginning of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.

> Blink and you'll miss it! The fastest mammal in the world, the cheetah, is one of Tanzania's iconic big cats. Pictured here in Ngorongoro Conservation Area, cheetahs inhabit diverse landscapes from the Serengeti grasslands to the arid expanses of the Sahara. They have long tails, elongated legs, and a slender build that helps them move quickly.
> 
> In early Egyptian mythology, Mafdet, goddess of justice, would often be depicted as a woman wearing the head of a cheetah. Ancient Egyptians also believed that cheetahs carried away the spirits of departed pharaohs. These days, cheetahs face threats from habitat loss, human conflict, poaching, and diseases, leaving their global population vulnerable. Let's commit to protecting their habitat and preserving their legacy for generations to come.

> Let's step into a world of giant earthen homes designed to house a village. These 'tulou' structures, built between the 12th and 20th centuries, are the dwellings of the Hakka community in China's mountainous southeastern Fujian region. The homes are constructed from clay, sandy soil, and gray tiles, with bamboo strips serving as the support. They were built to house a whole clan, up to 800 people each. From above, these round dwellings look like giant tires or reels lying on their sides, with light walls, dark roofs, and spacious interiors.
> 
> Historically, these buildings were communal living spaces and defensive zones for Hakka clans. They were built with uniformly sized and shaped family areas, fostering a sense of equality and community. In 2008, UNESCO added Fujian Tulou, which includes 46 of the buildings, to its list of World Heritage Sites, recognizing their unique building tradition. So, if you are longing for a getaway that transcends the ordinary, come to Fujian Tulou!

> Take advantage of the last day of National Park Week! If you haven't had time to take part, we've got your back. Let us take you to Guadalupe Mountains National Park in West Texas. The park, officially established in 1972, covers 86,416 acres. Here, the Guadalupe Mountains rise over the salt dunes of the Chihuahuan Desert and include the highest point in Texas, the 8,751-foot Guadalupe Peak. Pictured on today's homepage is another iconic landmark, El Capitan. Not to be confused with its famous namesake in California, this limestone cliff towers 8,085 feet high and is often used as a waymark for travelers. Even if National Park Week is over, there are plenty of days in the year to visit the country's abundant natural splendor.

> Get your binoculars and field guide and head to a local park, as it's National Go Birding Day! Held on the last Saturday in April, this holiday celebrates birdwatching, an activity enjoyed by millions worldwide. There are approximately 18,000 known bird species around the world. Birds come in a wide range of sizes, colors, and behaviors, making them one of the most diverse groups of animals on Earthâ€”from imposing eagles to today's tiny snowy-winged star, a leucistic Anna's hummingbird in the Australian Garden at the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum. These hummingbirds are typically vibrant in color, but leucism means some have decreased pigmentation, resulting in a paler appearance. Unlike albino birds, these hummingbirds do not have red or pink eyes. Their lighter plumage reduces protective camouflage, making them more vulnerable to predators such as hawks and feral cats.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The first Arbor Day in the US was held in 1872. Since then, the event has really taken root. On the last Friday of April, people across the country mark the occasion by planting trees, often dedicating them to a loved one. It's also a great day to celebrate trees themselves. As well as providing homes for countless species of animals, trees absorb carbon dioxide and clean the air we breathe. They also help to keep cities cooler and can even play a role in preventing floods.
> 
> The amazing tree in today's image is the Tree of Life at Kalaloch Beach on Washington's Pacific coast. Seemingly defying gravity, this large Sitka spruce's roots cling to the sides of a small gully. The soil under the tree is slowly being worn away by a stream that flows into the Pacific Ocean, yet, somehow, the Tree of Life continues to grow. Given its will to live, it's easy to understand how this tree earned its nickname.

Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
