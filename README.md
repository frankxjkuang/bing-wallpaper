> Remember the cousin who convinced you to climb the tallest tree or the one who helped you sneak an extra slice of cake at the family reunion? Today is a good time to appreciate those childhood partners in crime who made growing up way more exciting. Cousins often land somewhere between sibling and friend, getting into trouble with you, sharing inside jokes, and showing up at every family gathering. In nature, few creatures mirror that kind of togetherness better than the ashy woodswallow, pictured here. Native to South Asia, these birds are rarely seen alone. They gather in tight groups on bare branches or perch atop high places like powerlines. From there, they launch into graceful flights—flapping and gliding as they snatch insects midair.
> 
> Cousins Day may not come with gift guides or special sales, but it is a great reason to drop a text, make a call, or laugh over a shared memory. Cousins aren't just relatives; they're the ones who make family feel like fun. And just like these snug little woodswallows, life's a little warmer when they're close.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In the middle of Rome, Italy, lies an entire country of its own: Vatican City. At just 121 acres, it's the smallest independent nation in the world, yet its reach spans centuries and continents. Home to the pope and the spiritual center of the Roman Catholic Church, this walled enclave is a blend of art, history, and devotion. At its core stands St. Peter's Basilica. Seen in the distance in today's image, this Renaissance masterpiece is built over what is believed to be the tomb of St. Peter, the first bishop of Rome. With its soaring dome dominating the skyline, the basilica is one of the largest churches in the world. Just beyond the basilica lies St. Peter's Square, where thousands gather for papal blessings. The Vatican Museums and the Sistine Chapel, which houses Michelangelo's famed ceiling, are other must-sees. Despite its size, Vatican City has its own postal service, telephone system, and banking system.

> As the sun sets over Badlands National Park, the landscape transforms into a stunning display of color. The national park, located in southwestern South Dakota, features a dramatic terrain of eroded buttes, pinnacles, and spires carved by millennia of wind and water. Spanning over 379 square miles, the park is divided into three main units: the North Unit, home to the visitor center and scenic Badlands Loop Road; and the Stronghold and Palmer Creek units. The park's dramatic terrain is the result of sedimentary rock layers eroding at a rate of about one inch per year, revealing colorful bands of volcanic ash, silt, and clay. These formations are not only visually striking but also rich in fossils, including remains from the Oligocene Epoch (about 33.9 to 23 million years ago), such as ancient horses, camels, and saber-toothed cats.
> 
> Beyond its geology, Badlands National Park protects the largest mixed-grass prairie in the US, supporting wildlife like bison, bighorn sheep, prairie dogs, and the endangered black-footed ferret. Visitors can explore its rugged beauty while also learning about the cultural significance of the land.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Every third week of July, Coral Reef Awareness Week reminds us that beneath the ocean's surface lies a world as rich and complex as any rainforest. Coral reefs—like the staghorn coral pictured here off the coast of Bonaire in the Caribbean Netherlands—are home to roughly 25% of all marine species, despite covering less than 1% of the seafloor. These ecosystems not only support ocean biodiversity but also protect coastlines and drive economies through tourism and fishing.
> 
> But coral reefs are in crisis. Warming oceans, pollution, and overfishing have put over 70% of coral reefs at risk—a figure expected to rise in the coming years. Coral Reef Awareness Week encourages everyone to help—whether by choosing reef-safe sunscreen, joining a beach cleanup, or supporting reef conservation organizations. Every little act counts.

> Every July 20, we celebrate National Moon Day, marking the historic moment when Neil Armstrong first stepped onto the moon in 1969. Uttering the iconic words, 'That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,' Armstrong became the first human to walk on the moon, followed by Buzz Aldrin.
> 
> The moon landing was the result of President John F. Kennedy's bold 1961 goal to send a man to the moon and return him safely before the decade's end. Apollo 11 launched from Kennedy Space Center on July 16, 1969, reaching lunar orbit by July 19. On July 20, the Eagle lunar module touched down, and the world held its breath as history unfolded.
> 
> Moon Day honors not just that first step, but also the science, teamwork, and peaceful international cooperation that made it possible—and continue to drive space exploration today.

> Every July, nature enthusiasts gather for National Moth Week to celebrate the beauty and diversity of moths. Featured in today's image is the luna moth, a species whose charm rivals that of butterflies. Also known as the American moon moth, this striking insect—with its lime-green wings and white body—can be found across North America. Its caterpillars are also green and known for their impressive size, as well as their ability to emit clicking sounds and regurgitate intestinal contents as a defense mechanism against predators.
> 
> National Moth Week, held during the last full week of July, encourages communities to host 'mothing' events, where participants use light or bait to attract moths for observation and data collection. This citizen science initiative began in 2012 in central New Jersey and has since expanded to over 90 countries, engaging people in the fascinating world of moths. With their incredible diversity and ecological importance, moths play crucial roles in pollination and serve as a vital food source for other wildlife.
> 
> So the next time you leave a light on during a balmy summer night, keep an eye out—one of these nocturnal visitors might just flutter by.

Here, evidence of volcanic activity is on full display in the form of rare hexagonal basalt columns. These sea cliffs are shaped into natural sculptures so symmetrical that they look almost human-made. These striking formations were created around 2 million years ago, when thick basalt lava cooled slowly, contracting and cracking into geometric shapes that form near-perfect hexagons. Though Iceland is full of volcanic marvels, formations like these are rare, making this quiet cove truly remarkable.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
