<summary>Description</summary>

> What's as colorful as the diversity and history of humankind? The Latino Cultural Center in Dallas, Texas. Its vibrant walls—seen in today's image—rise from a 27,000-square-foot foundation and celebrate Latino and Hispanic arts and culture. From September 15 to October 15, our country observes Hispanic Heritage Month, honoring the histories, cultures, and contributions of Americans with roots in Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central and South America.
> 
> One of the most dynamic places to experience this celebration is the Latino Cultural Center. Designed by renowned Mexican architect Ricardo Legorreta, the center is a bold landmark that blends modern design with traditional Mexican aesthetics. Since its opening in 2003, the venue has hosted over 300 events annually, including art exhibitions, theater performances, and community workshops. During Hispanic Heritage Month, it becomes a lively hub, showcasing local Latino artists, folkloric dance, and cultural storytelling. Notable exhibitions have featured artists including Celia Álvarez Muñoz, Judy Baca, Margaret Garcia, and Benito Huerta. Whether you're attending a performance or admiring its architecture, the Latino Cultural Center stands as a powerful tribute to the enduring influence of Hispanic culture in American life.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Olympic National Park covers a rare mix of terrain—and that's part of its unique appeal. Alpine ridges, quiet forests, and one of the longest stretches of undeveloped coastline in the lower 48 all meet here. Spanning nearly 1,400 square miles in Washington State, this UNESCO World Heritage Site drew over 3.7 million visitors in 2024. Originally protected in 1909 as Mount Olympus National Monument by President Theodore Roosevelt, the area became a national park in 1938.
> 
> Rain isn't a problem here—it's the reason this moss-draped area exists. On the western edge of the park, the Hoh Rainforest receives about 140 inches of rain a year—over 11 feet—and it wears every drop proudly. Towering Sitka spruces, western red cedars, and coast Douglas firs line trails like the Hall of Mosses, while banana slugs, bobcats, and Olympic black bears call the forest home. The Hoh is one of the best-preserved temperate rainforests in the world. And if you're chasing waterfalls, Sol Duc Falls delivers—three streams plunging into a narrow, mossy gorge. Olympic is a solid reminder that the best hikes don't always come with clear skies.

> It's not polished or curated—and that's exactly the point. Drive just over an hour north of San Francisco, and you'll reach Point Reyes National Seashore—a place where fog drifts slowly, tule elk roam freely, and time seems to pause. Established by Congress on this day in 1962, the park was set aside to protect this piece of coastline for public enjoyment and environmental conservation. It covers over 100 square miles and features an impressive array of landscapes, from coastal prairie and blustery headlands to sandy shores and Douglas fir woodlands.
> 
> At the park's eastern boundary, Chimney Rock—seen in today's image—extends into the Pacific Ocean with towering cliffs and sweeping sea views. Its trail is considered one of the best spots on the West Coast to witness the gray whale migration. In the winter months, nearby secluded beaches become a refuge for northern elephant seals, offering an opportunity for wildlife viewing. With over 490 species of birds, more than 80 types of mammals, and numerous rare plants, Point Reyes ranks among the most ecologically diverse places in the country. Over 150 miles of trails invite visitors to slow their pace and immerse themselves in the surroundings.

<summary>Description</summary>

> With lifelong bonds, signature whistles, and echolocation, dolphins are more than just smart swimmers. First observed in 2022, World Dolphin Day shines a light on these intelligent marine mammals and the oceans they rely on. The day encourages people to learn about their behavior and the threats they face. Over 40 dolphin species swim our seas, from the Māui dolphin to the Irrawaddy dolphin. They're expert navigators, problem-solvers, and team players. Some even form superpods—temporary gatherings of hundreds or thousands of dolphins moving together offshore.
> 
> Off the coast of Marsa Alam in Egypt, pods of spinner dolphins glide through the warm waters of the Red Sea—as seen in today's image. True to their name, they can leap and spin in the air up to seven times in a single jump. Found in tropical waters across the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans, they rest during the day in calm bays and hunt offshore at night. But their predictable routines have left them vulnerable to unregulated tourism. Some conservation zones now limit visitor access to allow dolphins to rest undisturbed. The hope? That these creatures continue their spins without interruption.

<summary>Description</summary>

> September 11, 2001, began like any other day—until history changed in an instant. Nearly 3,000 innocent lives were lost in the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and aboard United Airlines Flight 93. Today, on Patriot Day, we honor the fallen and the countless acts of courage that emerged in the face of tragedy, from firefighters and first responders to ordinary citizens who became heroes. At 8:46 AM Eastern Time—the moment the first plane struck the North Tower—Americans observe a moment of silence. Permanent memorials now stand at each of the three sites. Visiting one or volunteering in your community is a meaningful way to participate in the National Day of Service and honor those who continue to serve.
> 
> In Lower Manhattan, where the Twin Towers once stood, One World Trade Center rises as a symbol of resilience. Its height—1,776 feet—is a deliberate reference to the birth of American independence. In New York Harbor, the Statue of Liberty stands watch over the skyline both as a witness to tragedy and a guardian of hope.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> 'Make hay while the sun shines' may sound like an old proverb, but in farming it's a practical truth. Hay baling plays a crucial role in agriculture worldwide. It involves cutting, drying, and packaging grasses to feed livestock during the colder months. The process depends heavily on the weather: the grass must be dry before it's baled, or it risks molding. Farmers must act quickly once a dry spell arrives, making it a seasonal race.
> 
> The practice of baling dates back centuries, evolving from horse-powered balers of the 1800s to today's high-powered machines that can wrap and eject bales in minutes. In North Yorkshire, England—where today's image was taken—the rolling lowlands and upland meadows create ideal conditions for growing and curing high-quality hay. With grazing livestock such as sheep and cattle making up around 40% of farm holdings, hay is a key feed resource supporting the region's rural economy. So, when you see golden fields dotted with neat, sunlit rolls, you're witnessing the result of careful timing and hard work. It's a tradition that remains as important today as ever.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Quick, clever, and always on the move—meet the Eurasian red squirrel, a leafy treetop resident found across much of Europe and Asia. While it prefers the shelter of forests, this agile creature easily adapts to gardens and parks. It builds its nest, called a drey, high in the fork of a tree using twigs to form a domed structure about 10 to 12 inches wide. The female featured here is gathering moss—one of several soft materials, along with bark, leaves, and grass, that line the nest and turn it into a snug, well-insulated retreat. These rodents may also take over tree hollows or abandoned woodpecker holes when available.
> 
> Typically solitary and quite shy, they rarely share food or space. However, during colder months, it's not uncommon for several individuals to use the same nest to stay warm. Their social organization is shaped by dominance hierarchies, both within and between the sexes. While males aren't always dominant over females, the top-ranking individuals tend to be older and larger. Dominant males also tend to occupy larger home ranges than subordinate males or most females.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
