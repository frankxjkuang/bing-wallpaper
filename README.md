<summary>Description</summary>

> These medieval towers stand tall over San Gimignano, a small town near Siena in north central Italy. In the Middle Ages, a town grew up around a church dedicated to St. Geminianus (San Gimignano in Italian). As well as being a popular stop for pilgrims on their way to Rome, the town prospered thanks to its trade in local Vernaccia wine and in saffron, which is grown in the nearby hills. However, when the Black Death struck in 1348, half the population was lost, slowing the town's development and preserving its medieval character to this day.
> 
> San Gimignano's most recognizable feature is its skyline, made up of 14 towers. These impressive structures were the result of a rivalry between two families, each competing to build the tallest tower-house. By the end of the medieval period, there were 72 towers in the town, although because of wars, other catastrophes, and building projects, many were lost. Today, the tallest tower still standing is the Torre Grossa (Big Tower). Built in 1310, it stands at an incredible 177 feet. It's no wonder that the town is sometimes called the Manhattan of the Middle Ages.

> We're off to a roaring start today: It's International Tiger Day, which aims to protect these magnificent big cats amid threats such as poaching and habitat loss. At the end of the 19th century, there were thought to be around 100,000 tigers in the wild; these days, there are fewer than 6,000.
> 
> Today's image features a pair of tigers in Jim Corbett National Park, which covers approximately 200 square miles in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. India is home to more than 70% of the world's wild tigers, and the park was the first to be included in its initiative to protect them: Project Tiger. There are 256 Bengal tigers here, master predators that play an essential role in the park's ecosystem. Tigers are at the top of the food chain, often hunting large animals like water buffalo and even small elephants. Visitors can book a jungle safari, accompanied by forest rangers.

> Welcome to the Palatinate, a wine lover's dream come true. This wine-growing region in western Germany has rolling hills, fertile soils, and a warm climate, allowing the cultivation of a diverse variety of grapes. While riesling reigns supreme, other notable varieties include chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, pinot blanc, Müller-Thurgau, and Dornfelder. The Palatinate is the largest red wine-producing region in the country, with over 40% of the vineyards devoted to it.
>

The region is also home to the Wurstmarkt, recognized as the world's largest wine festival, held in Bad Dürkheim. It draws over 600,000 visitors every year. So, let's raise a toast to the Palatinate.

> Welcome to Paris, the City of Light, which is hosting the Summer Olympics for the third time. What makes these Games unique is the opening ceremony, which will be held outside a stadium for the first time. Participants will parade along the Seine on a flotilla of boats, passing under the Pont Neuf, pictured here, and cheered by spectators lining both banks. Paris is no stranger to historic firsts; the 1900 Games included women competing for the first time, although they made up only 22 of 997 athletes.
> 
> These Games are set to be rather special: Breakdancing will make its Summer Olympic debut in Paris. Competitors will be scored by a panel of nine judges who will look out for creativity and personality, along with other criteria. This could be a one-off, as breakdancing hasn't been included in the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. The surfing event at Paris 2024 is also rather unique: the competition will take place in Tahiti, part of French Polynesia. Almost 10,000 miles away from the host city, Tahiti was chosen because the island's huge waves make it perfect for surfing.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
