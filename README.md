> Within the scenic landscape of Navarra, northern Spain, the Bardenas Reales Biosphere Reserve and Natural Park is like a surrealist painting come to life! This park is renowned for its desert-like landscapes sculpted by millennia of erosion. Featuring rocky plateaus, canyons, and whimsically shaped clay structures called cabezos, the park is a playground of geological wonders.
> 
> Designated as a natural park in 1999 and a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 2000, Bardenas Reales is also a haven for diverse flora and fauna adapted to its arid conditions. The park is home to a variety of birds and animals, such as the great bustard, golden eagles, vultures, mountain cats, wild boars, and numerous reptiles. Spread across around 104,000 acres, the park's semi-desert environment and unique geological formations make it an important site for scientific research and conservation efforts. If you wish to discover a place where natural beauty meets wild surprises around every bend, Bardenas Reales should be on your bucket list!

> The lush greenery of June is here, and so is National Rivers Month, a 30-day tribute to the veins of our planet that was created by Canadian activist Mark Angelo. Just like the confluence featured here today, where Alaska's Easter Creek and Killik River unite in a beautiful display, we too come together every year to help preserve the nation's rivers. With increasing threats such as pollution, habitat destruction, and overuse, it's more important than ever to advocate for the protection of our waterways. Whether you're paddling down a gentle stream, casting a line for some fishing fun, or simply enjoying a leisurely stroll along the riverbank, there are countless ways to connect with these flowing wonders. The US alone boasts a vast network of over 250,000 rivers that stretches more than 3 million miles across diverse terrains. Which one are you heading to?

> Today, let's embark on a watery adventure as we celebrate World Oceans Day. This day is about honoring and protecting the world's oceans and serves as a reminder of the critical role oceans play in supporting life on Earth. These gargantuan water bodies, after all, teem with wonders, from the tiniest plankton to the grandest whales like the humpbacks we see here. The oceans also produce almost half of the oxygen on our planet thanks to the photosynthesis of plankton—tiny plants, algae, and bacteria. Moreover, they absorb a significant amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping mitigate the impacts of climate change caused by human activities.
> 
> Oceans face many threats, including rising sea temperatures thanks to global warming, plastic pollution, and ocean acidification, which threatens many marine species. The theme for this year's World Oceans Day is 'Awaken New Depths.' This motto encourages us to delve deeper into the ocean's complexities and take urgent actions to ensure that these fascinating, ocean-dwelling animals continue to grace our planet for generations to come. So, are you ready to take the plunge?

<summary>Description</summary>

> Eighty years ago, on the beaches of Normandy, northern France, an event unfolded that would alter the course of history. The day was June 6, 1944, a date forever etched in time as D-Day. It marked the launch of Operation Overlord, the ambitious Allied invasion that became a turning point in World War II. The audacious assault by sea, air, and land involved nearly 160,000 troops.
> 
> Today, on this 80th anniversary, we are featuring Les Braves, a sculpture that pays tribute to the courageous troops who landed here. One such symbol is Les Braves, a sculpture gracing Omaha Beach. French artist Anilore Banon's design features three sections called 'Wings of Hope,' 'Rise, Freedom!,' and 'Wings of Fraternity.' In addition, across the ocean in Michigan, its twin, 'Les Braves II: At Water's Edge,' resonates with the same spirit at The War Memorial. These sister sculptures stand as guardians of memory, inviting a moment of silence from a world that benefited from the bravest of the brave.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Happy World Environment Day! First celebrated back in 1973, this UN event is now celebrated in more than 143 countries. This year's theme focuses on land restoration, desertification, and drought resilience.
> 
> Pictured here is Madagascar's Masoala National Park, part of the Rainforests of the Atsinanana UNESCO World Heritage Site. This park, which covers nearly 930 square miles, is a wildlife haven harboring hundreds of species including mammals like red ruffed lemurs and aye-ayes, birds like red owls and helmet vanga, reptiles like Madagascar day geckos and tomato frogs, and butterflies, coral species, fish, and sea turtles. The park has been at the forefront of conservation efforts to combat illegal logging, particularly of its rare rosewood trees. So, let's take inspiration from Masoala and champion the planet that cradles us all. After all, there is no planet B.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> It's not just a name. Chestnut-headed bee-eaters spend their days swooping after stinging insects. As well as bees, they also feast on wasps, hornets, and other bugs. The birds in today's image are in Bardia National Park in Nepal, but they're found across many other South Asian countries, from India and Bangladesh to Sri Lanka and Thailand. They catch their prey in mid-flight, returning to a perch where they beat insects to stun them and remove the stinger, which makes them safe to eat. These birds are designed to hunt: Their dazzling green plumage helps camouflage them in dappled jungle light, their curved beak is perfect for picking off insects with precision, and their eyes can move individually, which makes them all the better for spotting bees.

> Bicycles are the best! An environmentally friendly form of transportation that is affordable and good for your health. Once you learn to ride, you'll never forget how to wheel around. Thanks to Polish American scientist Leszek Sibiliski's initiative, the United Nations declared June 3 World Bicycle Day in 2018.
> 
> Karl von Drais, a German inventor, is credited with developing the first two-wheeler, known variously as the laufmaschine, draisine, and vélocipède, in 1817. It certainly needed some further thinking, since the wooden frame and wheels didn't have pedals. The modern versions of bikes were developed in the late 1800s, but the materials used for them are constantly evolving to make the ride easier and more secure. So, hop on a bike to find your crew on World Bicycle Day!

As civilizations rise and fall around them, these hardy trees remain resilient and steadfast.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
