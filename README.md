<summary>Description</summary>

> The Temple of Philae, often called the Temple of Isis, is one of Egypt's most enchanting ancient sites. Originally built on Philae Island, it was moved to nearby Agilkia Island to save it from flooding. The international rescue effort, launched by UNESCO in the 1960s, required a monumental effort that involved moving more than 40,000 stones. Today, it's a peaceful spot surrounded by the Nile—perfect for a scenic boat ride and a journey into the past.
> 
> To enter the temple complex, sightseers step through a grand gateway that leads to a courtyard lined with towering columns. The main temple is dedicated to Isis, the goddess of magic, motherhood, and protection, and its walls are covered in carvings that tell her story. Smaller chapels and shrines tucked around the site, including ones for Osiris (the Egyptian god of the underworld and brother-husband to Isis) and Horus (the sky deity depicted with a falcon head). Visitors can explore this UNESCO World Heritage Site freely or join a guided tour. At night, a sound-and-light show brings ancient myths to life. The temple's intricate carvings and well-preserved structures provide a fascinating glimpse into Egypt's ancient history.

> Get ready for one of the most dazzling celestial displays of the year—the Perseid meteor shower. Active from mid-July through late August, this year it reaches its spectacular peak on the night of August 12 and into the early hours of August 13. The Perseids light up the skies when Earth passes through a trail of icy and rocky debris left behind by Comet Swift–Tuttle, which last passed close to our planet in 1992. These meteors are called the Perseids because they appear to streak from the direction of the constellation Perseus.
> 
> For those hoping to catch a glimpse of this breathtaking show, the Perseid meteor shower is best viewed from the Northern Hemisphere, extending down to the mid-southern latitudes. One such vantage point is Great Basin National Park in Nevada, seen in today's image, where ancient bristlecone pines stand beneath a sky ablaze with shooting stars. These remarkable trees are the oldest non-clonal species on Earth. Shaped by relentless wind, snow, and rain, they've endured for millennia—witnessing ice ages, volcanic eruptions, and the rise and fall of civilizations.

> Sharks have been around for over 400 million years—outlasting dinosaurs, surviving ice ages, and weathering mass extinctions. They are symbols of ocean health, which is why Shark Awareness Day draws attention to these apex predators that help maintain balance in marine ecosystems. Protecting sharks means preserving the health of entire ocean environments—and ultimately, securing a sustainable future for all life. With many shark species facing the threat of extinction, this day is all about appreciating their ancient legacy and learning how we can help keep them off the endangered list.
> 
> Take the blue shark, featured here, for example—sleek, wide-ranging, and undeniably captivating. It's the only living member of its genus, and it prefers the deep waters of temperate and tropical oceans. While typically a laid-back swimmer, it's capable of sudden bursts of speed when needed. Blue sharks are famous for their epic migrations—some travel from New England to South America, guided by seasonal changes, food availability, and favorable environmental conditions. They give birth to live young and are known for their large litters—ranging from 25 to over 100 pups. After birth, the young head to special nursery zones, far from adult habitats, where they can grow and learn the ways of the sea.

> Do you think rocks are just … well, rocks? These natural mineral combinations have done more than just sit around—they've built the Earth's crust and helped humans shape history. From Stone Age tools to the minerals powering modern civilization, rocks have been essential throughout our journey. International Rock Day celebrates this enduring impact, inviting us to explore the science of rocks, admire their natural beauty, and recognize the rich variety they add to our world.
> 
> If you're wondering where to see geology in action, Iceland is a great place to explore. Today's image takes us to Kálfshamarsvík—a secluded cove on the country's remote Skagi Peninsula. Unlike Iceland's famous black sand beaches, this cove's shore is strewn with large, smooth pebbles, while its fiery volcanic past still reveals itself in the towering cliffs. Here, evidence of volcanic activity is on full display in the form of rare hexagonal basalt columns. These sea cliffs are shaped into natural sculptures so symmetrical that they look almost human-made. These striking formations were created around 2 million years ago, when thick basalt lava cooled slowly, contracting and cracking into geometric shapes that form near-perfect hexagons. Though Iceland is full of volcanic marvels, formations like these are rare, making this quiet cove truly remarkable.

> There's something about the way animals move through the grasslands of the Maasai Mara, bathed in golden rays, that makes you pause and simply watch. This stretch of savanna in southwestern Kenya teems with wildlife—from elephants stomping through bushes to cheetahs scanning the horizon. Yet sometimes it's the smaller creatures that grab attention—like the Thomson's gazelles featured in today's image.
> 
> Known as 'tommies,' Thomson's gazelles are among the fastest animals in Africa, reaching speeds of up to 50 miles per hour. They thrive in the Mara's short grass plains, which provide a clear view of approaching predators. Though adults may seem to be grazing peacefully, their ears are always tuned to nearby movements.
> 
> Mating occurs year-round, peaking just before the rainy season. Males hold territories, waiting for females to pass through. After a five- to six-month gestation period, the female gives birth to one fawn, weighing around 4 to 6 pounds. For the first few weeks, the small gazelle stays hidden most of the day with the mother returning briefly to nurse. These early days are crucial as the young learn to run and blend in. Despite their delicate appearance, tommies are tough. Many join the great migration during the dry season, relying on their agility and the awareness of wildebeests and zebras to evade danger in search of greener plains.

> We are living in a full house, and it is getting fuller. With 8.2 billion people and counting, World Population Day highlights how that growth affects cities, food, and the future. First observed in 1989, the day focuses on how unchecked population growth affects sustainability. The event was inspired by Five Billion Day in 1987, which marked the approximate date when the global population hit that milestone. As cities expand, green spaces shrink, and agriculture competes for limited land and water resources. But there is a way forward—investing in education, improving access to healthcare, and building smarter cities can balance growth with sustainability.
> 
> On a global scale, India remains the most populous country in 2025 with over 1.46 billion people, followed by China at 1.41 billion. The United States trails with around 339 million, though its growth is slowing and aging populations are becoming a new challenge. Tokyo, the world's largest city with around 37.2 million people, illustrates the realities of high-density urban life: overcrowded spaces, transport congestion, and rising demand for services. World Population Day is more than a head count—it's a call for better planning and long-term thinking to ensure future generations can thrive on a planet with finite resources.

> The Bahamas comes alive with color, music, and pride today as the nation marks its Independence Day. First recorded by Europeans in 1492 when Christopher Columbus arrived, the islands were initially under Spanish rule. They later came briefly under American control before becoming a British colony. After decades of legal negotiations and a growing push for self-governance, the Bahamas transitioned to full independence on this day in 1973.
> 
> In the lead-up to July 10, Bahamians across the archipelago take part in spirited celebrations, including National Pride Day, ecumenical services, and community walks and runs. These events shine a spotlight on the nation's vibrant culture, heritage, and deep sense of patriotism. And what better backdrop for such festivities than the breathtaking turquoise waters that surround the islands? The shallow, white sandbanks reflect sunlight in a way that gives the ocean its signature electric-blue glow, pictured here. Whether you're snorkeling among coral reefs, watching fireworks from a beachfront, or cruising the Exuma Cays under the golden sun, it seems the ocean sparkles just a little brighter on Independence Day.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
