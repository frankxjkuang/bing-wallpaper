<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to the Palatinate, a wine lover's dream come true. This wine-growing region in western Germany has rolling hills, fertile soils, and a warm climate, allowing the cultivation of a diverse variety of grapes. While riesling reigns supreme, other notable varieties include chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, pinot blanc, Müller-Thurgau, and Dornfelder. The Palatinate is the largest red wine-producing region in the country, with over 40% of the vineyards devoted to it.
> 
> Visitors can try schorle, a drink made by mixing wine with sparkling water that is a popular choice at annual wine festivals held in the Palatinate's wine-producing towns. The region is also home to the Wurstmarkt, recognized as the world's largest wine festival, held in Bad Dürkheim. It draws over 600,000 visitors every year. So, let's raise a toast to the Palatinate. Prost!

> Welcome to Paris, the City of Light, which is hosting the Summer Olympics for the third time. What makes these Games unique is the opening ceremony, which will be held outside a stadium for the first time. Participants will parade along the Seine on a flotilla of boats, passing under the Pont Neuf, pictured here, and cheered by spectators lining both banks. Paris is no stranger to historic firsts; the 1900 Games included women competing for the first time, although they made up only 22 of 997 athletes.
> 
> These Games are set to be rather special: Breakdancing will make its Summer Olympic debut in Paris. Competitors will be scored by a panel of nine judges who will look out for creativity and personality, along with other criteria. This could be a one-off, as breakdancing hasn't been included in the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. The surfing event at Paris 2024 is also rather unique: the competition will take place in Tahiti, part of French Polynesia. Almost 10,000 miles away from the host city, Tahiti was chosen because the island's huge waves make it perfect for surfing.

> Fancy a walk through the Smokies in Tennessee, seen in today's image? Spanning over 522,000 acres between North Carolina and Tennessee, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a treasure trove of natural beauty and biodiversity. Home to more than 19,000 documented species, scientists estimate that tens of thousands more remain undiscovered. Miles of hiking trails wind through the dense woodlands, leading adventurers to cascading waterfalls and scenic overlooks. The park also boasts some of the highest mountains in the eastern United States, including Clingmans Dome, which rises to 6,643 feet. Visitors are often enchanted by the mist that blankets the peaks each morning, giving the park its mystical name. The park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and an International Biosphere Reserve.
> 
> In every season, it offers a unique spectacle: the wildflower bloom in spring, vibrant foliage in fall, and serene snow-covered landscapes in winter. Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a haven for nature lovers and adventurers alike, promising unforgettable experiences and a deeper connection to the natural world.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Perched on a rocky headland is Methoni Castle, a symbol of medieval might on the shores of the Ionian Sea. The fortress, on the Peloponnese peninsula in southern Greece, was built by the Venetians in the early 13th century as a trading post and defensive bastion, protecting the coastline from invaders. Its Bourtzi tower, an extension of the fortress standing on a small islet, was once connected to the main castle by a stone bridge.
> 
> Many conquerors, from the Ottomans in 1500 to the French in 1828, aimed to win Methoni's strategic position. Some original structures, like the castle itself, still stand, allowing visitors to walk through the same gates where soldiers once marched. The village's blend of architecture, with Byzantine, Venetian, and Ottoman influences, narrates a storied past where European powers battled for dominance.

> Imagine swaying gently under a canopy of leaves, a soft breeze coaxing you into a serene slumber while you gaze at the stars above. Observed every July 22, Hammock Day is not just a nod to the lazy lull of summer days, but an homage to an ancient tradition. Invented by the Indigenous peoples of Central and South America, hammocks were called 'hamacas' and were originally woven for sleep and relaxation.
> 
> Back then hammocks were made from tree bark, whereas now they can be made of various materials like cotton, nylon, and canvas. These sleeping swings have crossed oceans as beds for sailors, swung from the trees, and nowadays, add a touch of chill to hip outdoor retreats. They have health benefits, too; gentle rocking can improve your sleep and even relieve stress. So go ahead, jump into a hammock, and let it sway your worries away.
