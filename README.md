> Amid the rolling hills of northern Vietnam's YÃªn BÃ¡i province, the rice terraces of MÃ¹ Cang Cháº£i district are a mosaic of agricultural excellence. The Hmong people, an ethnic minority who migrated here from China in the 19th century, have meticulously carved these cascading hills for generations. MÃ¹ Cang Cháº£i boasts approximately 5,500 acres of terraced rice fields, which flood with water between September and October, reflecting the surrounding mountains and sky. Visitors can also indulge in Vietnamese dishes and colorful souvenirs at the local markets or climb to the peak of La Pan Tan village to enjoy views of this stunning landscape.

> Welcome to walled town of Conwy, on the north coast of Wales, UK, and its spectacular medieval castle. Conwy Castle was built between 1283 and 1287 on the orders of English King Edward I, during his conquest of Wales. Designed by James of St. George, one of the greatest architects of the time, the castle is a UNESCO World Heritage Site which draws visitors from across the world.
> 
> The castle towers over the River Conwy, which this weekend hosts the annual Conwy River Festival, including boat races and other water-based events. Spectators gather to witness the nautical parade and enjoy local delicacies like bara brith, a tea bread flavored with tea, dried fruits, and spices, and laverbread made from edible seaweed. The name Conwy is from the Welsh words 'cyn' (chief) and 'gwy' (water) and the town sits at the mouth of the river. It is also the gateway to Eryri National Park, home to Wales's highest mountain Yr Wyddfa, or Snowdon in English.

> Welcome to a land where greenery meets the endless blue. On the North Queensland coast of Australia, encircled by dense foliage, is Noah Beach. A fascinating blend of two ecosystems, here the Daintree Rainforest seamlessly meets the azure waters of the Coral Sea. This secluded area of the Daintree National Park boasts a stretch of soft, golden sands while elsewhere there are towering trees, lush ferns, and other plant species unique to the area. The Daintree is believed to have been around for up to 180 million years, making it the oldest tropical rainforest in the world. It is also Australia's largest uninterrupted stretch of tropical rainforest and home to rare species like Bennett's tree-kangaroo, found nowhere else on our planet.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today the sky sparkles with shades of patriotism as our nation celebrates its Independence Day! The Declaration of Independence was adopted by delegates from the 13 colonies on July 4, 1776. The Founding Fathers proclaimed that the colonies were now unified, independent, and sovereign states, no longer under the authority of Britain's King George III.
> 
> Independence Day sees an array of festivities including fireworks, parades, barbecues, carnivals, and concerts. Featured here is a glimpse of the Fourth of July fireworks over the Hudson River in New York City. Traditionally held over the East River, the fireworks show moved to the Hudson between 2009 and 2014. A decade later, this year's Fourth of July fireworks display will once again light up the skies above the Hudson River.

<summary>Description</summary>

> It is World Meerkat Day, a celebration of these adorably upstanding creatures. Despite the name, they are not related to cats. They're small carnivores of the mongoose family, native to the deserts and grasslands of southwestern Africa. Meerkats live in mobs, tight-knit groups of up to 30 individuals that forage together, groom each other, and take turns watching for predators. These critters create huge burrows where they spend the night and retreat to escape the midday heat.
> 
> World Meerkat Day, founded in 2018, raises awareness about meerkats and their ecological importance, which includes controlling insect populations in their desert habitats. So, let's spread the word, ensuring future generations continue to be captivated by these remarkable creatures.

<summary>Description</summary>

> It was the year 206 BCE. In the wake of the decisive Roman victory against the Carthaginians at the Battle of Ilipa, General Publius Cornelius Scipio built a settlement for veterans on the banks of the Guadalquivir River, in modern-day Spain. It was named Italica and was the first Roman settlement on the Iberian Peninsula. The city flourished in the following centuries and was the birthplace of two Roman emperors, Trajan and Hadrian.
> 
> The ruins of Italica, close to Seville, include the impressive amphitheater seen in today's image. One of the largest in the Roman Empire, it could accommodate up to 25,000 spectators, more than double the city's population. Beyond this, there are remains of public buildings, a temple built in honor of Trajan, baths, and villas decorated with stunning mosaics. Italica is an archeological gem, offering a glimpse into the grandeur of the Roman Empire.

> Today, Canada celebrates its national day. It commemorates the passing of the Constitution Act of 1867, which joined three British colonies, the Province of Canada (later Quebec and Ontario), New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, to become the self-governing country of Canada.
> 
> Canada is the second-largest country by landmass after Russia. Eighty percent of its land is unoccupied and every corner abounds in natural treasuresâ€”like the Great Bear Rainforest, the Northwest Passage, the Columbia Icefield or the Haida Gwaii archipelago. Celebrations including parades, fireworks, and other patriotic festivities will be held across this huge country today. Among those hosting events will be the Fisgard Lighthouse, pictured on our homepage looking out over Esquimalt Harbor in Colwood, British Columbia. The tower was the first lighthouse on the west coast of Canada, built on Fisgard Island in 1860.

Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
