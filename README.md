> Happy International Mountain Day!  In celebration of highlands, we're visiting the dramatic landscape of Huangshan—the Yellow Mountains—of eastern China's Anhui province. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Huangshan has been described as 'the loveliest mountain of China' and has inspired artists and writers throughout history. Composed of granite that formed 140 million years ago, its peaks emerge from seas of clouds, rising to 6,115 feet at its highest point, Lotus Peak. Visitors come here to experience breathtaking rock formations, pine trees, hot springs, and captivating winter landscapes. So, let's climb high, dream big, and protect our mountains!

> The Sahara spans over 3 million square miles of North Africa, covering large parts of various countries including Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Sudan, and Tunisia. Vast sand dunes, rocky plateaus, and occasional oases create a landscape like no other. Although it is the largest hot desert in the world, the Sahara supports drought-resistant plants like acacia and palm trees, and hardy animals such as camels and fennec foxes. Intriguing features include its shifting sand dunes, pictured in today's image, some of which are over 500 feet high. Ancient rock art and fossils have also been discovered here, providing insights into early civilizations and prehistoric creatures. Sandstorms are common, shaping the ever-changing scenery and adding to the mystique of this natural wonder.

> Strap on your hiking boots because it's National Llama Day! December 9 is a designated day to appreciate these intelligent and trainable creatures. You'll need to visit the Andes Mountains to see their wild cousins, guanacos. Guanacos are believed to have originated in the central plains of North America 40 million years ago, but they gradually migrated to South America. Scientists think llamas descended from guanacos and were first domesticated around 4500 BCE.
> 
> As seen in today's image, guanacos are often spotted roaming free in Los Glaciares National Park, Argentina, sporting dark cinnamon-colored wool and cartoonish-looking faces. Cute as they are, they can be a bit rude: Both guanacos and llamas defend themselves by spitting to assert dominance within their herd or to keep intrusive peers at bay. Don't let this deter you from going on an organized llama trek though—they can make for great pack animal companions!

> Just off the coast of Normandy, France lies Jersey, a British island with a Norse name. Found on the southeastern shore of the island is La Rocque Harbour, home to a white, sandy beach and an elevated walkway that stretches out into the water. The shoreline's granite and plutonic rocks, which originated more than 420 million years ago, showcase a variety of colors and textures. Visible from the harbor are the round, stubby Icho Tower and the taller Seymour Tower, built in the 18th and 19th centuries respectively as coastal defense structures. Both structures are over 1,800 feet away from the shore and can be reached on foot with a sturdy pair of shoes, but only on the days of the year where the tide is lowest.

<summary>Description</summary>

> On the morning of December 7, 1941, American history changed forever when a surprise attack was launched on the US Naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Japanese bombers and submarines struck the island of Oahu, taking the lives of 2,403 Americans and damaging or destroying over 300 airplanes and nearly 20% of the 100-ship Pacific Fleet. The United States entered World War II immediately after the attack, and the event hastened Hawaii's path to become the 50th state to join the union. As 82 years have passed, few veterans of Pearl Harbor are still alive today. Lou Conter, the last surviving crew member of the USS Arizona, its memorial seen here, turned 102 in September. So, thank you to Lou, and all others who served our country on that infamous day.

> The Bavarian Alps, a mountain range in southern Germany, are home to these enchanting 19th-century castles, Neuschwanstein and Hohenschwangau. Neuschwanstein Castle, on the left of our homepage image, was commissioned by King Ludwig II of Bavaria. Building work began in 1869 on this Romanesque Revival palace with its fairy-tale-like architecture and breathtaking mountain backdrop. Across the valley, gazing out over Lake Alpsee, is the equally spectacular Hohenschwangau Castle, built by Ludwig II's father, King Maximilian II of Bavaria. These two castles boast rich interiors with intricate artwork and historical artifacts. Both castles attract millions of visitors every year, offering a glimpse into the opulent past of Bavaria.

When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
