> On the morning of December 7, 1941, American history changed forever when a surprise attack was launched on the US Naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Japanese bombers and submarines struck the island of Oahu, taking the lives of 2,403 Americans and damaging or destroying over 300 airplanes and nearly 20% of the 100-ship Pacific Fleet. The United States entered World War II immediately after the attack, and the event hastened Hawaii's path to become the 50th state to join the union. As 82 years have passed, few veterans of Pearl Harbor are still alive today. Lou Conter, the last surviving crew member of the USS Arizona, its memorial seen here, turned 102 in September. So, thank you to Lou, and all others who served our country on that infamous day.

> Computer science is a dynamically developing discipline that has revolutionized our lives within a few decades. For Computer Science Education Week, we celebrate information systems and their power to connect the world, 24 hours a day. Where better to mark the occasion than the European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN—birthplace of the World Wide Web? The 89-foot ball seen on today’s homepage is CERN's Globe of Science and Innovation in Switzerland, in which visitors can learn more about the organization's research work on particle physics. Quiet observers can wander around exhibitions and follow guided tours, and curious minds can take part in lab workshops and science shows for a first-hand experience.

> The Bavarian Alps, a mountain range in southern Germany, are home to these enchanting 19th-century castles, Neuschwanstein and Hohenschwangau. Neuschwanstein Castle, on the left of our homepage image, was commissioned by King Ludwig II of Bavaria. Building work began in 1869 on this Romanesque Revival palace with its fairy-tale-like architecture and breathtaking mountain backdrop. Across the valley, gazing out over Lake Alpsee, is the equally spectacular Hohenschwangau Castle, built by Ludwig II's father, King Maximilian II of Bavaria. These two castles boast rich interiors with intricate artwork and historical artifacts. Both castles attract millions of visitors every year, offering a glimpse into the opulent past of Bavaria.

> In the heart of the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya, cheetahs reign as the sprinting champions of the wildlife kingdom. With speeds up to 70 miles per hour, cheetahs thrive on the open savanna, always on alert for signs of prey. While the Maasai Mara is known for its exceptional East African cheetah population, globally the species' survival is threatened by habitat loss and human influence. Today, which is both International Cheetah Day and Wildlife Conservation Day, let's raise awareness about the cheetah's plight. It's a day to appreciate the beauty and importance of not just these wild cats, but all wildlife that shares the world with us.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The windiest, coldest, and driest continent on Earth—Antarctica—was officially discovered in 1820. In the following decades, several countries organized expeditions to reach and explore the Antarctic ice sheets. The southernmost continent had no indigenous population and various nations claimed ownership. But in 1959, 12 countries signed the Antarctic Treaty, banning military activities and setting Antarctica aside for scientific research. Today, we celebrate the anniversary of this treaty, which now has 56 parties.
> 
> From suspended clouds of ice crystals to a subglacial, iron oxide-rich lake that seeps into a blood-red waterfall, this polar desert is full of natural wonders. Its massive ice sheet stores about 70% of the world's fresh water, enough to raise sea levels by more than 200 feet if it were to melt entirely.
