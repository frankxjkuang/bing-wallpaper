> With eight arms and plenty of charm, the octopus takes the spotlight today. On World Octopus Day, as we reflect on their brilliance, we're reminded that even these ocean geniuses can't outsmart threats like climate change and pollution. Protecting their homes means safeguarding the future of our seas.
> 
> Meet the master of disguise—the day octopus (Octopus cyanea). Found across the Pacific and Indian Oceans, from Hawaii to Africa's eastern coast, this reef-dweller is a true shapeshifter. Unlike most of its kin, it hunts in broad daylight, instantly shifting its color, pattern, and even skin texture to blend into its surroundings. At times, it even performs a clever 'passing clouds' act, casting a false shadow to trick crabs into moving at just the wrong moment. And once the trap is sprung, the hunter wastes no time. A skilled predator, this octopus prowls the reef for fish, crabs, shrimp, and mollusks. Smaller catches are devoured on the spot, while larger prey is dragged back to its den.

<summary>Description</summary>

> It's that time of year when the hills shed their summer greens, unveiling a blaze of colors that lights up the season. The change usually begins in September and early October, with higher slopes turning first, followed by the lower valleys. Among the stars of this display are the aspens, whose leaves shimmer like gold coins in the sunlight. The magic of aspen colors, however, isn't guaranteed year after year. Their golden glow depends on many factors—tree health, local weather shifts, soil moisture, and where they grow in terms of elevation and latitude. Healthy aspens are the true stars of the season: strong, thriving groves burst with brighter colors and hold onto their leaves longer, while stressed or weakened trees often fade quickly, offering only a glimpse of their usual brilliance. Today's image captures their full glow at the base of Mount Sneffels, the highest peak in Colorado's Sneffels Range, rising more than 7,000 feet above the town of Ridgway.

> The shiver felt under a full autumn moon, when the air hints at winter's arrival, has a way of lingering in memory. One of China's most cherished holidays, the Mid-Autumn Festival—also known as the Moon Festival—adds another touch of magic to the end of the harvest season. It's celebrated on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month of the Chinese calendar—this year, on October 6. According to legend, it's also the night when the moon goddess Chang'e watches over the world.
> 
> Families gather to share mooncakes—round pastries filled with sweet or savory goodness—and enjoy lanterns, moon gazing, and heartfelt reunions. One of the most enchanting sights is the Anshun Bridge in Chengdu, China—seen in today's image—glowing in golden light to honor the festival. Its arches reflect in the Jin River, creating a dreamy scene. In the United States, communities with Asian heritage celebrate with lantern parades, mooncake tastings, and cultural gatherings in cities like San Francisco, New York, and Dallas. Tonight, let the light guide you to the moon and back.

> The tradition of teaching is deeply rooted in human history. Today, we honor those who dedicate their lives to sharing knowledge and shaping minds. Happy World Teachers' Day to all the educators who have helped us become who we are.
> 
> From Confucius in ancient China to Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle in ancient Greece, and Maria Montessori in 20th-century Italy, teachers have not only shaped lives—they've shaped history. Many cultural icons once stood at the front of a classroom. Did you know that Stephen King, for instance, taught English before becoming a bestselling author?
> 
> Teachers are essential pillars of a thriving society. Recognizing this, UNESCO and the International Labour Organization established October 5 as World Teachers' Day in 1994 to celebrate and support educators worldwide. As a tribute to wisdom, today's image features a boreal owl. The owl has long symbolized intelligence and insight. One of the earliest associations comes from Greek mythology: the goddess of wisdom, Athena, was often depicted with a small owl, her sacred animal. This nocturnal companion came to represent clarity, perception, and the ability to see beyond the surface.

> From October 4 to 10, World Space Week invites us to transcend our earthly bounds and chase the stars. It was born from the launch of Sputnik 1 by the USSR in 1957 and the signing of the Outer Space Treaty in 1967, a pioneering international commitment to peaceful cosmic exploration. During this week, classrooms buzz with experiments, planetariums echo with wonder, and telescopes bridge the gap to distant galaxies. Together, these moments weave a universal story of science, discovery, and humanity's relentless drive to push boundaries. The week's mission is clear: to ignite the next generation of explorers, engineers, and dreamers ready to rewrite the cosmos.
> 
> Today's image captures the International Space Station, a vast laboratory built by 15 nations, orbiting about 260 miles above Earth. Its solar arrays soak up sunlight to power groundbreaking research on microgravity, technology, and human survival beyond our planet. Shot from the SpaceX Crew Dragon Endeavour—a reusable spacecraft that has completed six missions since 2020, ferrying astronauts and cargo—this scene embodies what humanity can achieve when it chooses cooperation over competition. Each gleaming panel makes it clear: the final frontier is within reach, and the audacity to explore it defines us.

> Mists curl, waters glimmer, and legends linger—welcome to Glen Brittle. On the Isle of Skye, Scotland's fabled 'Misty Isle,' the glen stretches in a sweep of purple heather carpeting its rugged slopes. The landscape hums with echoes of the past: dinosaurs left footprints on these cliffs long before Mesolithic hunters traced its streams over 8,000 years ago. In the 9th century, seafaring Norse Vikings settled here. Centuries later, the powerful MacLeod and MacDonald clans claimed these lands, their castles standing guard over countless battles and alliances.
> 
> Among the hills and hidden lochs, the Fairy Pools shimmer in emerald and turquoise, tumbling over volcanic rock—a place where, according to local tales, fairies once danced under the moonlight. Nearby, Loch Coruisk, the 'Cauldron of Waters,' tucked beneath the jagged Black Cuillin peaks, is said to be haunted by a kelpie, a shape-shifting water spirit. Red deer glide silently through the heather, rabbits vanish along secret trails, and golden eagles wheel above. Glen Brittle is where geology, wildlife, and human history intertwine. Every stone, waterfall, and valley tells a story—step softly and listen closely.

> Beyond water, rivers carry life, history, and stories. They are nature's ever-moving contribution to our landscapes, flowing through lands and across time. One such gem is the Snake River, which winds through Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. A particularly stunning spot along this river is Oxbow Bend—featured in today's image—where calm waters reflect the towering Teton Range, and wildlife such as moose and bald eagles thrive. Here, water flows freely, unbound by concrete or commerce, protected by the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, signed on this day in 1968.
> 
> This landmark law is a promise: that some rivers shall run wild forever. It safeguards waters with 'outstandingly remarkable' beauty, ecology, and spirit—rivers that sing of wilderness and whisper of heritage. The Snake River Headwaters, including Oxbow Bend, joined this sacred list in 2009, ensuring its reflections remain undisturbed and its rhythms unbroken.
> 
> At dawn, mist dances over the bend, and the mountains blush with the first light. Visitors pause, hushed by nature's poetry. Thanks to this Act, the river's story flows on—untamed, unspoiled, unforgettable.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
