<summary>Description</summary>

> Western Monarch Day celebrates a stunning natural phenomenon, the annual migration of thousands of flame-colored butterflies to California. Traveling south to escape the winter weather, they use air currents to help them make journeys of hundreds of miles. They descend to gather in large numbers on eucalyptus trees, like the ones pictured on our homepage today in Goleta, Santa Barbara County. Those gathered to see clusters of butterflies in 100-foot-tall trees might confuse them for clumps of leaves at first. However, as the sun's rays gently fall upon them, their wings will begin to flutter. Bring your binoculars and take the opportunity to witness these winged wonders huddled together. It's truly a sight to behold!

<summary>Description</summary>

> Step through time and into the cavernous depths of Devetashka Cave in Bulgaria, a sprawling prehistoric complex which humans called home for tens of thousands of years. These days, it is home to bats, about 30,000 of them, as well as rare birds and reptiles. This karst cave was formed by erosion and is now part of a public park. Humans are thought to have sought shelter here as far back as the Early Stone Age, about 70,000 years ago, and many Neolithic artefacts from 6000-4000 BCE have been discovered. Several large openings in the cave cast natural light into the chambers, offering better illumination for photographers and nature lovers alike.

> Don your tricorn hat and gilded disguise, it's time to visit the Carnival of Venice. This centuries-old festival combines revelry with anonymity, thanks to the masks traditionally worn by attendees, from the classic square-jawed Bauta mask to the Colombina eye mask, with roots in Italian theater. Costumed rowers take part in a parade of traditional boats on Venice's famous Grand Canal while thousands of people wearing elaborate costumes enjoy the carnival atmosphere. Parades, parties, concerts, and performances will fill the streets until festivities end on Shrove Tuesday, which falls on February 13 this year. Visitors might pass by the Santa Maria della Salute, seen toward the back of today's image, a baroque basilica dedicated to the Virgin Mary, who is considered to be the protector of the city.

> How long will winter last? Much depends on whether a certain groundhog sees his shadow today in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. On February 2, Punxsutawney Phil emerges from his tree stump, helped by members of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club's 'inner circle.' According to local legend, the same stocky groundhog has been predicting the weather since at least 1886 and if he sees his shadow, we can expect six more weeks of winter. If he does not, an early spring awaits.
> 
> Phil is said to make his prediction by choosing one of two scrolls, which top-hatted men then read out to the crowd, who cheer Phil on either way. Our homepage star today is a relative of Phil's, an alpine marmot, which has its own winter tradition of stocking up on food to prepare for a long hibernation. Let's hope that Phil doesn't see his shadow so we can exit our own.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Born in New Orleans around the turn of the 20th century, with a sound that came from the blues, ragtime, and call-and-response vocals, jazz music is a notable chapter in Black history. You can almost hear John 'Dizzy' Gillespie playing his signature bent trumpet, featured on our homepage today. Gillespie made his name in bebop, often called the first modern form of jazz, playing alongside other greats including Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, and Thelonious Monk. Black musicians created genres like rock and roll, funk, hip-hop, and soul, the soundtrack to American culture and Black history.

<summary>Description</summary>

> It's time for some black-and-white thinking. January 31 is International Zebra Day, celebrating the stripey creatures pictured here in Rietvlei Nature Reserve, South Africa. There are three species of zebra: plains, mountain, and Grévy's, and several subspecies. The mother and foal on our homepage are Burchell's zebras, a subspecies of the plains zebra. Found across eastern and southern Africa, zebras thrive in savannas, shrublands, woodlands, and mountain regions. They spend most of their time eating grasses, leaves, and shrubs, and can travel hundreds of miles in search of food and water. Sadly, all three species are under threat due to hunting and habitat destruction. International Zebra Day aims to raise awareness of conservation efforts, to help protect these striking creatures.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to the tiny Spanish village of Aýna, in a steep valley carved by the River Mundo in the Sierra del Segura range. This part of the Castile-La Mancha region is sometimes called Manchegan Switzerland, thanks to those snow-capped peaks during the winter months. The steep, rocky terrain here means the villagers, of whom there are less than 1,000, cultivate the land on terraces dug into the mountainside. To see Aýna from this perspective, you'll need to visit the Mirador del Diablo, or Devil's Viewpoint, one of several viewing areas dotted around this picturesque valley.
