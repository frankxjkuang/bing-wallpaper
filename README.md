<summary>Description</summary>

> Tonight, Halloween casts its spell—and only a few places on Earth carry a mystery quite like Bran Castle in Romania. The fortress was built in the 14th century and has withstood wars, monarchs, and shifting empires. But here, legends speak louder than history. Perched between the regions of Transylvania—renowned for its chilling tales—and Wallachia, once ruled by Vlad III Dracula, the castle evokes a haunting legacy. Vlad's ruthless reputation inspired Bram Stoker's 1897 Gothic novel 'Dracula.' Though the story is not set at Bran Castle, its looming form and persistent rumors of Vlad's presence blur fact and legend, forever linking it to one of humanity's most enduring tales.
> 
> Beyond the pages of storybooks, Bran Castle whispers many other haunted narratives. According to local accounts, the sorrowful White Lady drifts through the courtyard; a monk's muffled steps echo from behind the walls that sealed him in; and the playful laughter of unseen children carries through the corridors. Reports of flickering lights, sudden chills, and disembodied voices heighten the unease. On this Halloween, Bran Castle rises beyond the stones that shape it. Here, memory twists into myth, and the line between reality and the supernatural grows thrillingly thin.

> Every fall, the desert town of Pushkar in Rajasthan, India, comes alive with one of the most colorful gatherings—the Pushkar Camel Fair. Timed with the Hindu lunar month of Kartik, it usually takes place between late October and early November on the Gregorian calendar. This year, the celebrations stretch from today until November 5, marking the region's most anticipated season.
> 
> What began as one of the world's largest camel and cattle markets has gradually transformed into a grand celebration of culture and community. Alongside the trading of cattle and camels, visitors now enjoy quirky competitions like 'matka phod' (pot breaking), longest mustache contest, and even bridal shows. Rural families explore vibrant stalls overflowing with textiles, clothes, and glittering bracelets, while the fair itself kicks off with a high-spirited camel race, followed by traditional songs, dances, and lively performances. Among the highlights is the camel showcase, where participants take turns riding the animals in an animated display that adds to the festive charm. In recent years, the fair has introduced new attractions too, including a friendly football match between the local Pushkar Club and teams of foreign tourists.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The Portuguese island of Madeira—about 600 miles southwest of mainland Portugal—hides a forest unlike any other. On its northern slopes lies Fanal Forest, where veils of mist drift through centuries-old til trees. These are part of the Laurissilva of Madeira—an outstanding relict of a once widespread laurel forest type. Laurissilva is the largest surviving area of its kind, with about 90% considered primary forest. Home to a unique array of plants and animals, including endemic species such as the Madeiran long-toed pigeon, it remains a living museum of natural history.
> 
> In Fanal, the gnarled, moss-draped trunks stand as guardians of this ancient heritage, where nature has preserved its vitality for centuries. Beyond the trails, these woods also offer quiet corners to pause and enjoy. Between scenic viewpoints, a leisure area with a public barbecue, and even a winter lake born from an ancient crater, this is a place to be dazzled, to wander, to play—or simply to breathe and relax.

<summary>Description</summary>

> From 18th-century visitors to fire-carved trails, this rock city tells a story of survival. Hidden in Czechia's Hradec Králové Region, the Adršpach–Teplice Rocks form Central Europe's largest sandstone labyrinth. For centuries, the cliffs and passages lay cloaked in forest, until a great fire stripped the land bare. Arches, towers, and winding corridors emerged out of the ashes, and the first hiking paths were carved into the rock. Soon after, explorers and poets left their marks with stone inscriptions that captured a destination both wild and enchanting.
> 
> Today, the reserve stretches over 5 square miles, preserved within the Broumovsko Protected Landscape Area. Among its treasures stands the Gothic Gate, featured here, which was built in 1839. Commissioned by Ludvik Karel Nádherný along with a network of hiking paths, bridges, and stairways, this striking archway became the symbolic threshold to the City of Rocks. More than a relic of the past, the Gothic Gate still stands as guardian of the labyrinth, welcoming every visitor who steps into the park.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Perched high in the mountains of Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia, the thick-billed raven holds the title of the world's largest raven. At nearly 28 inches in length and weighing more than 3 pounds, it is about a quarter heavier than the common raven. Its enormous, arched bill—pale at the base and close to 3.5 inches long—is the largest among perching birds. These ravens live mostly between 5,000 and 11,200 feet above sea level, found across farmland, rocky cliffs, and even rooftops in mountain towns.
> 
> Thick-billed ravens are versatile feeders, taking carrion, insects, beetle larvae, seeds, and crops like wheat, along with scraps from people. Observers have seen them pulling grubs from dung heaps and even forcing Verreaux's eagle-owls from their nests. Often seen in pairs or small groups, they build large stick nests on cliffs or tall trees, laying three to five bluish-green eggs. Their calls range from deep croaks to wheezy notes, and rare instances of mimicry have been recorded. Their plumage gleams purple in sunlight, a striking figure of the African highlands. Classified as 'least-concern' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the thick-billed raven continues to thrive.

> Nothing says fall like spotting a field full of pumpkins waiting to be picked. These gourds have rolled their way into pies, porches, lattes, and parades, but today they get the spotlight: It's National Pumpkin Day. Some places go all out to show their affection—Morton, Illinois, calls itself the 'Pumpkin Capital of the World,' thanks to its high production and ties to canned pumpkin. New Hampshire follows closely, with pumpkin as its official state fruit.
> 
> Ever wondered why we carve this squash? The tradition comes from an old Irish story about a man called Stingy Jack. According to legend, Jack tricked the Devil multiple times and was denied entry to both heaven and hell, leaving him to wander the Earth with only a carved-out turnip and a glowing coal to light his way. Immigrants brought the tale to America, where pumpkins—larger and easier to carve than turnips—became the canvas for glowing jack-o'-lanterns. The Connecticut field pumpkin is the go-to variety thanks to its size, smooth skin, and bright orange hue. The color of pumpkins comes from beta-carotene, but not all are orange—some grow white, green, or even blue. Their utility doesn't end there—pumpkins have stood guard as scarecrows, been launched in pumpkin-chucking contests, and even hollowed out for boat races. So, have you sharpened your carving tools?

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today, we step into the Martimoaapa Mire Reserve in Finland, where wide, cold-climate wetlands and peatlands stretch across a landscape shaped over thousands of years. This reserve is more than just mires—it carries layers of history. During Finland's Prohibition era (1919–1932), smugglers hauled sacks of liquor from Sweden across these bogs, following a 'spirits' route that passed through Martimoaapa. Parts of that path can still be traced today. Imagine trekking with a heavy pack over soggy ground—would you have made it?
> 
> This is just the beginning. Here, archaeologists have discovered brackish pits once used to store meat, and a mysterious stone circle about 33 feet wide—like something out of a northern myth. Its purpose? Still unknown. More recent history lives on in the Saunasaari sauna, once part of a logging cabin built for men who worked these boreal forests. It gave them warmth, rest, and a place to dry off.
> 
> Wildlife, ever-present, completes the picture. Nearly 100 bird species nest here, from swans and cranes to owls and kestrels. Trails ranging from 1.9 to 8 miles, dotted with huts and campfire sites, invite you to explore—on foot or on skis in winter.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
