<summary>Description</summary>

> With deep rocky canyons and high ancient sea ledges, Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico boasts some of the most unique rock formations in the world. Hidden beneath its desert scenery are more than 119 caves—formed when sulfuric acid dissolved the surrounding limestone. This national park, founded on this day in 1930, is also home to North America's largest underground chamber—the Big Room. From colossal stalactite formations hanging like chandeliers to stalagmite structures reaching for the ceiling, every nook and cranny is a masterpiece crafted over millions of years. This UNESCO World Heritage Site also organizes events like bat flight viewings, which allow visitors to watch thousands of bats as they swoop in and out of the cavern. Are you ready to explore the depths?

> Mothers, the perennial source of love and comfort, may not wear capes, but they are the true heroes in our lives. In today's image, we see a mother and baby guanaco, a relative of the llama, roaming the vast grasslands of La Pampa, Argentina. Just like a human mom, a guanaco female is fiercely protective of her child, also known as a 'chulengo.'

> The modern Mother's Day originated in the US in the early 20th century. It came about thanks to the efforts of Anna Jarvis, who wanted to honor the wishes of her late mother, Ann, a social activist who had called for a day to celebrate mothers. In 1908, Anna organized the first Mother's Day service of worship and celebration. In 1914, President Woodrow Wilson officially declared the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day, making it a national holiday.

> This pristine aquatic sanctuary so pristine that it feels like a secret whispered by the ocean itself. Misool is an island of almost 800 square miles within the Raja Ampat archipelago in Indonesia. The archipelago comprises four main islands, including Misool, Waigeo, Batanta, and Salawati. Here, the waves caress the powder-white sands, while a kaleidoscope of marine life swims beneath the surface. Raja Ampat is part of the Coral Triangle, a remote ocean wilderness that is home to hundreds of species of reef-building corals alongside marine turtles, sharks, whales, dugongs, dolphins, and thousands of species of reef fish. The archipelago is dotted with Marine Protected Areas, of which Misool is the largest, and includes nesting beaches for green and hawksbill turtles. Surrounded by a 'no-take zone' with fishing and hunting activities banned and a shark and manta ray sanctuary, Misool offers hope for the future of our oceans.
