<summary>Description</summary>

> A chilly paradise awaits at the St. Paul Winter Carnival! This annual celebration, taking place between January 25 and February 4 this year, transforms Minnesota's capital city into a winter wonderland. It all started in 1885, when a group of reporters visited and referred to Minnesota as another Siberia, unfit for human habitation. This offended city officials who devised a plan to showcase the area's winter beauty. The Winter Carnival was born, featuring seasonal activities such as bobsledding and ice horse-racing. Today, the carnival attracts visitors and strengthens community bonds through parades, markets, and winter sports. And ice sculptors carve stunning but fleeting works of art, like the frozen palace towering over today's image.

> While other owls spend their days sleeping off the night before, the northern hawk-owl is a bird of a different feather. One of the few owls active during the day, that piercing gaze scours the boreal forests of North America, Europe, and Asia for prey. Northern hawk-owls aren't picky eaters: Mice, rats, voles, lemmings, rabbits, shrews, moles, and the occasional frog are all on the menu. These vocal birds have different calls for mating, chatting with their young, and warning that danger is nearby. If you get too close to their nest, protective parents have been known to swoop at humans to keep them away.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Ynys Llanddwyn is a tiny tidal island which, at low tide, is attached to the Isle of Anglesey in Wales. Ynys means 'island' in Welsh and Llanddwyn means 'the church of Dwynwen,' the country's patron saint of lovers.
> 
> Legend has it that Dwynwen, a 5th-century Welsh princess, sought solace on this island after a tragic love story. The young woman fell in love with a commoner, but because her royal father forbade the union—and briefly turned her beloved into a block of ice—she moved to the island and set up a convent. She dedicated her life to spirituality, living as a hermit and helping others with matters of the heart. The ruins of Dwynwen's church, a well, and a convent remain on Ynys Llanddwyn and St. Dwynwen's Day, on January 25, is the most romantic day in Wales—the country's very own Valentine's Day.

> From fjords and lava fields to ice caves and black sand beaches, Iceland is a treasure trove of natural wonders. The volcanic black sand of Diamond Beach, pictured in today's image, sparkles with pieces of iceberg washed ashore from the nearby Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon. The contrast between the clear ice and black sand looks particularly surreal when sunlight hits the ice, making it a must-visit destination on Iceland's south coast.

<summary>Description</summary>

> With nearly 1,200 islands spread over a chain of 26 atolls, the Maldives are popular with tourists seeking serene beaches, scuba diving, and surf in the Indian Ocean. The atolls, like those pictured on our homepage, are made up of coral reefs that formed around the top of now-sunken volcanoes. Some are single, ring-shaped islands enclosing lagoons while other atolls are a series of small, connected islets, many of which are uninhabited.
> 
> The country is also home to Baa Atoll, a UNESCO biosphere reserve whose numerous coral reefs, islands, and mangroves make it a globally important habitat for species including whale sharks, manta rays, and marine turtles. The Maldives archipelago is rich in biodiversity but faces an existential threat from climate change. As lowest-lying country in the world, much of which is less than 4 feet above sea level, it is extremely vulnerable to rising sea levels. By the end of the century, it is thought that the islands could disappear altogether.

Built in 2002, this 40-foot-tall building replaced a more modest light. The Walton Lighthouse got its name from Charles Walton, a businessman who helped fund its construction in memory of his brother Derek, a merchant seaman who died at sea during World War II.

> Have you ever been captivated by a squirrel crossing your path? January 21 is Squirrel Awareness Day, honoring these furry seed distributors. Today's homepage star is the Eurasian red squirrel, whose striking reddish-brown coat, white underbelly, and bushy tail are a familiar sight in several countries. These squirrels are not only exceptional jumpers—capable of leaping up to 6 feet in one jump—they can even swim to search for food. They gather nuts and acorns in the autumn and hide them, to see them through the winter months. If you spot fuzzy-tailed squirrels frolicking in your backyard, they might also appreciate a feeding station stocked with treats such as raspberries or crab apples.
