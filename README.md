> In southern Vietnam, where emerald rice fields stretch to the horizon and the Mekong River flows with life-giving waters, the annual water lily harvest looks from above like a well-choreographed dance with nature.
> 
> When the river floods, it becomes a photographer's paradise, awash with flowering lilies. These farmers in Long An province are pictured wading in waist-deep to harvest the long-stemmed plants, which will be bundled up for sale. The lilies contribute to the local economy as the stems are edible and the plant can be brewed into tea or used for decoration. Here flooding is a part of life, bringing nutrients from upstream which enrich fields and help these flowers to grow, painting the Mekong River in stunning shades of pink and white.

> On October 18, 1867, the Russian Empire transferred the territory of Alaska to the United States following negotiations by US Secretary of State William Seward. The US paid $7.2 million, or about 2 cents per acre, for the land, adding more than 586,0000 square miles to its territory. Today the date is known as Alaska Day and honors the history, untamed wilderness, and unwavering resilience of the state.

> To mark the day, we are in the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge, spread over several islands in the Kodiak Archipelago in southwestern Alaska. Our homepage image shows Kodiak Island, whose landscape includes hundreds of miles of shoreline as well as lakes, marshes, bogs, and meadows. Its towering mountains are home to fjord inlets and lush vegetation, including sedges, alders, spruces, wildflowers, and berries. A wild inhabitant of the islands, the Kodiak bear, the largest subspecies of brown bear, is named after the archipelago.

> Happy Spreadsheet Day! Be they a pivot table pro or an entry-level novice, spreadsheet users worldwide have one person to thank: Dan Bricklin released the first electronic spreadsheet program on this day in 1979. The day celebrates the sophisticated grids that have reshaped businesses from accounting and engineering to project management. But data handling did not begin in the digital age. Ancient civilizations had their own ways of recording and tracking the world around them, as seen in our homepage image.

> Cuneiform, a script characterized by wedge-shaped symbols, was used to transcribe languages of the ancient Near East, a region roughly corresponding to today's Middle East. First developed around 3500 BCE, it was used for thousands of years, until the 1st century CE. In the early 17th century, the publication of Achaemenid royal inscriptions at Persepolis—in modern-day Iran—shed light again on cuneiform. These inscriptions had a mix of languages and were finally deciphered in the 19th century.

> That jagged granite summit is Prusik Peak, an icon of Washington state's Enchantments region, high in the Cascade Mountain range. Getting here means a long, strenuous hike, and for much of the year it is covered in snow. But from midsummer through the fall, hikers and climbers arrive here as the larch trees turn golden. The granite peaks and autumnal colors are not the only attractions. The Enchantments boasts more than 700 alpine lakes and ponds, as well as herds of grazing mountain goats that roam this corner of the scenic Alpine Lakes Wilderness.

> Brown, round, tiny, and spiny—say hello to the European hedgehog. Our image was taken in Sussex, England, but you'll find these prickly creatures in gardens, parks, and woodland throughout Europe. Mostly nocturnal, they are welcomed by gardeners as they snack on snails and slugs. With leaves turning gold and the air getting chilly, our homepage hedgehog is all set to gain some weight for the winter.
> 
> Hedgehogs cozy up in their nests of logs and leaves and sleep away the winter blues. They slow down their heartbeats to conserve energy, helping them to survive on fat reserves until spring. Hedgehogs depend on their spines for defense against predators like foxes, badgers, and birds of prey. There are no native hedgehogs living in North America, but 17 species can be found across Europe, Asia, Africa, and New Zealand, snoozing the day away beneath bushes, leaves, and rocks and snuffling around by night.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Sky gazers have been counting down to today: a 'ring of fire' annular solar eclipse is here to darken the skies over the Americas! Solar eclipses happen when the moon passes between the sun and Earth, casting parts of Earth into shadow. In an annular solar eclipse, a halo effect is created when the moon blocks out most but not all, of the sun's light. An annulus—or ring—of light remains visible. Seen here from Doha, Qatar, in 2019, the phenomenon will appear today over the United States—traveling from Oregon to Texas before continuing to Central America and ending in South America. While the 'ring of fire' is visible only in certain areas, partial eclipses will grace parts of all 50 states.
> 
> For those fortunate enough to live on the path of this cosmic show, be cautious. Do not look directly at the eclipse without specialized eye protection. Don't hesitate to make travel plans to see it, as the US will have to wait until 2039 for the next such event.
