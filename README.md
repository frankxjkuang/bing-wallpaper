> Today we're heading to the Netherlands to visit the red foxes at the Amsterdamse Waterleidingduinen Nature Reserve. This protected area about 8 miles west of Amsterdam is host to not only a diverse assortment of plants and animals, but also hundreds of specially designed sand dunes that help filter rainwater. The Waterleidingduinen ('water supply dunes') have been the source of the city's drinking water since the 19th century.
> 
> Maybe for almost as long, red fox sightings have been common at the Waterleidingduinen. Red foxes are the world's largest foxes and are widespread across the Northern Hemisphere. They stick together with their families, the young often helping to care for the next generation of kits. Not fully content in the woods, red foxes are increasingly colonizing urban areas. It's just the latest move in a long history of foxes sharing the planet with humans, as they appear in the folklore of Native American, Greek, Celtic, and Chinese cultures.

> Finally, after years of planning, building, and controversy, the 2022 World Cup is kicking off in Qatar. It's the biggest event on the international soccer calendar, bringing together the globe's top teams to proudly represent their countries. The prestigious World Cup tournament has been held every four years since 1930, except when WWII derailed it in 1942 and 1946. There will be fierce competition in Qatar as the champion French team seeks to defend their title, with the final scheduled for Qatar National Day, December 18. This is the first World Cup hosted by a country in the Middle East, and it's later in the year than usual due to the hot weather in Qatar.
> 
> Controversy swirled around Qatar 2022 from the get-go. Senior officials in FIFA, soccer's governing body, expressed concerns about corruption in the process of awarding World Cup hosting to Qatar, though an internal investigation didn't prove any violation. Soon Qatar's treatment of the country's invaluable 2 million migrant workers—most from Africa and Asia—was criticized, with groups like Amnesty International citing unethical labor practices. While Qatar enacted new laws to improve worker safety, conditions, and pay due to the international spotlight, Amnesty has stressed that these laws must also be effectively implemented. Perhaps the extent of the reforms will be revealed as soccer fans flood the nation and the TV cameras roll.

> Color, creativity, and fun are three things that go along with being a kid, so what better way to illustrate World Children's Day than with this huge (we're talking more than 100,000 square feet!) piece of 'land art' in New York City, painted by the French-Swiss artist known as Saype. Gifted to the United Nations by Switzerland in honor of the UN's 75th anniversary, 'World in Progress II,' shows two children busily drawing and using origami to create their ideal world.
> 
> World Children's Day launched in 1954 as Universal Children's Day, and it's always celebrated on November 20, the date in 1959 when the UN adopted the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. The day is meant to focus global attention on improving the lives of children around the world, and to foster equality and inclusion among the youngest generation. After all, children are our future!

> Our photo brings us to a 16-mile stretch of the Virgin River where it cuts a spectacular thousand-foot-deep gorge through the upper reaches of Utah's Zion Canyon. Flowing through Zion National Park (which turns 103 today!), the Virgin River is home to unique plants and animals that aren't found anywhere else, due to the unique intersection of biomes found where the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert all meet. Without the water of the Virgin River system, creatures like the woundfin minnow, one of rarest species on the planet, couldn't exist.

> The International Day of Islamic Art, proclaimed by UNESCO in 2019, occurs every November 18 to celebrate past and contemporary artistic expressions of Islam, and to highlight Islamic artists' contributions to world civilization. November 18 also marks Morocco's independence day, commemorating Sultan Muhammad V's return to Morocco from exile in November 1955.
> 
> Our image honors both of today's events: You're beholding the main gates of the Dar al-Makhzen, the royal palace of the King of Morocco in the city of Fez. While the palace was originally founded in 1276, these ornate gates were added in the 1960s and '70s, crafted of wood and bronze—plus intricate mosaic tiling, a hallmark of Islamic art both old and new.

> It's National Take a Hike Day, so what better time to lace up those boots and head out on a trail to pay homage to John Muir, the patron saint (not really) of US hiking. Muir was instrumental in persuading the government that enjoying nature is the right of every American and that there should be an official national park system. He saw the spectacular beauty of the American West when he walked through the Sierra Nevada in California, and was passionate about preserving the country's national wonders. In 1892, Muir founded the Sierra Club, an environmental organization that protects wild lands to this day.
> 
> The US boasts more than 60,000 miles of national trails, and you can choose coastal paths or mountain climbs, forest meanders or historical walks like Boston's Freedom Trail. Our photo shows Oregon's McKenzie River National Recreation Trail, part of the Willamette National Forest. This trail winds by lakes, rivers, and springs, guiding you through shady old-growth forests. One highlight: the view overlooking Tamolitch Blue Pool, a crystal-clear pool created by the river bubbling up into it.

The World Heritage Sites program was sparked by Egypt's plans to construct the Aswan High Dam. UNESCO helped save thousands of antiquities that would have been lost as a result of the dam, which flooded a large swath of the Nile Valley.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
