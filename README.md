<summary>Description</summary>

> Just southwest of Ibiza, Spain, lie the uninhabited islets of Es Vedrà and Es Vedranell. Part of a protected nature reserve, these dramatic rock formations are admired for their ecological value and visual impact. Es Vedrà rises around 1,300 feet straight from the sea, its sheer limestone cliffs resembling a mountain range. Nearby, the jagged outline of Es Vedranell has earned it the nickname 'sleeping dragon,' appearing to guard its larger sibling.
> 
> Despite their stark appearance, the islets support a surprisingly rich ecosystem, including native flora, marine birds, endemic species such as the Ibiza wall lizard, and numerous invertebrates adapted to the rocky terrain. This fragile biodiversity is one of the reasons public access is tightly restricted.
> 
> Es Vedrà is also steeped in legend. Often compared to the Bermuda Triangle, it is said to lie within a powerful magnetic zone, inspiring stories of faulty compasses and strange lights. In Greek mythology, the islet is linked to the Sirens who lured Odysseus, while others believe it to be a remnant of the lost city of Atlantis. Wild and enigmatic, Es Vedrà and Es Vedranell are the kind of places that stay with you long after you've left.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The leopard cat is a small wild cat found across South, Southeast, and East Asia. Similar in size to a house cat but longer-legged and slenderer, it generally measures 15–30 inches long, with a tail about 7–12 inches. Depending on the region, adults weigh roughly 1–16 pounds. Their appearance varies widely: southern individuals tend to have warm golden coats, while those farther north often have pale gray fur that thickens for winter.
> 
> This species has several living subspecies, each adapted to its environment. These include the Bengal leopard cat found from India through Southeast Asia; the Javan, Sumatran, and Bornean leopard cats on the islands of Indonesia; and the Taiwan leopard cat. One of the most distinctive is seen in today's image: the Amur leopard cat, found in the Russian Far East, Manchuria, Korea, and nearby islands. It's larger and paler than its southern relatives, with features suited to cold, snowy forests.
> 
> Leopard cats are mostly nocturnal hunters, preying on rodents, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. They're adaptable too, living in forests, wetlands, mountains, and even agricultural landscapes across their wide range.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The island of Corfu, Greece, meets you at night with a quiet kind of intensity: stone facades catching warm lamplight, fortress walls rising in sharp outline, and narrow lanes unfolding like a lived-in labyrinth. The Old Town doesn't just look historic—it feels inhabited, shaped by centuries of shifting cultures and the slow rhythm of island life after dark.
> 
> Move beyond the historic center and Corfu shifts into a more dynamic landscape. Rugged rock formations edge the coastline, carved by wind and sea into dramatic shapes that catch the morning light. Forested hills roll toward turquoise bays and secluded coves, where the colors deepen and brighten throughout the day. In the interior, warm springs and mineral-rich waters offer a serene pause, tucked into pockets of green that feel removed from the bustle of the harbor.
> 
> Returning to Corfu's Old Town, the UNESCO-listed streets blend Venetian, French, and British influences into a uniquely Greek character—stone arcades, fortress walls, pastel buildings, and lively squares where cafés spill into narrow lanes. Together, Corfu's dramatic coastlines, natural springs, and storied Old Town create an island experience that transitions beautifully from quiet evenings to vivid, adventurous days.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia doesn't ease you in—it erupts into view like a horizon made of light. It's the world's largest salt flat, stretching across roughly 4,000 square miles at nearly 12,000 feet above sea level. The landscape dramatically shifts with the seasons: when the rain arrives, the surface floods just enough to become an enormous mirror, so perfectly reflective that sky and ground melt into a single glowing plane.
> 
> Around the salar, the landscape turns surprisingly varied. Rock formations sculpted by wind and time rise from the desert like abstract artwork—twisted, towering shapes that look almost deliberate. Not far away, steaming hot springs offer a soothing contrast to the crisp high‑altitude air, creating warm pockets of calm in the middle of the wilderness.
> 
> The surrounding lagunas and mineral‑rich lakes burst with unexpected color, and flocks of flamingos add flashes of motion to the stillness. Scattered nearby, ghost towns from Bolivia's mining era sit quietly against the vast white expanse, recalling the region's history with an air of mystery.

> The 2026 Winter Olympics begin today, and few settings capture their spirit better than the Dolomites. Rising sharply above the Giau Pass, the 8,514-foot Ra Gusela peak delivers the kind of dramatic alpine scenery that defines the Milano-Cortina 2026 Games—a joint edition hosted by Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, blending metropolitan energy with deep alpine heritage.
> 
> From February 6 to 22, athletes from around the world will compete across northern Italy, with ice sports centered in Milan and the fast, adrenaline-filled mountain events unfolding around Cortina's renowned slopes. Cortina last hosted the Winter Olympics in 1956 and will again welcome women's alpine skiing and the Olympic debut of ski mountaineering, a fitting addition in a landscape built for big climbs and breathtaking descents.
> 
> As viewers tune in from home, scenes like Ra Gusela rising over snowy pastures offer a glimpse of what makes these games so special: a celebration of athletic skill, resilience, and the raw beauty of winter in the Italian Alps.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Xwejni Bay in Gozo, Malta, has a way of making everyday elements look like a quiet choreography between sea, stone, and sun. You can't help but pause and look closer, right? Centuries back, families began carving these limestone pans, shaping hundreds of basins that trap seawater with each wave. Once the water settles in, the sun's heat does the rest, slowly evaporating it into natural Mediterranean salt. Gozo became a salt-making hub because its limestone coast is easy to shape, and its warm, dry summers keep the crystallization process steady. The first crystals form around May, marking the beginning of the harvesting season. Workers rake the salt by hand, sweep it with brooms and brushes, gather it into small piles to dry for another day, then bag it and store it in the caves.
> 
> Visitors can walk right up to the pans along the shore but look out for 'no trespassing' signs. If you swing by in the summer, you might spot active raking and drying. Take a moment to enjoy the view, and before you head back, consider collecting a salty souvenir from one of the many gourmet shops around Malta.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Picture this: it's 1955, a winter evening in Montgomery, Alabama. A seamstress heads home after work. The bus fills with other passengers. The driver demands she give up her seat. Rosa Parks wasn't trying to make waves, but her refusal set off a chain reaction that would propel the civil rights movement into a new phase. Raised in rural Alabama, she grew up under segregation and later worked with the NAACP as a secretary and investigator, gathering testimony of racial violence and discrimination. By the time she declined to move, she was already a committed activist.
> 
> Her arrest sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott, a coordinated 381-day protest that helped end bus segregation. Rosa Parks Day emerged decades later to honor her work. First celebrated in 1998 in Michigan, it is observed on different dates across states, tied either to her birthday or to the day of her arrest. As Parks' national impact grew, she earned various medals, awards, and the distinction of being the first woman to lie in honor at the US Capitol rotunda. The stained-glass painting of Parks at Shorter Community African Methodist Episcopal Church in Denver, pictured here today, serves as a glowing reminder of a legacy that still reaches far beyond Montgomery.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
