> Join us for a trip across the pond as we take a moment to examine the prickly European hedgehog. Our friend in today's photo is in Sussex, England, but European hedgehogs are widespread across the continent. They're thought to be the largest and heaviest of the hedgehog family. A nocturnal creature, the hedgehog can often be found in gardens snacking on its preferred diet of insects.
> 
> The European hedgehog is sometimes considered an invasive species. In New Zealand, for example, the hedgehog has no natural predators and threatens the food supply of native bush birds. But it's hard to blame such a cute little creature. With roughly 6,000 spines on its back, the hedgehog was, at one point, used as an unofficial symbol for NATO, chosen because it's a peaceful animal that has a rather pointed defense system.

> The bright light of the full moon is mirrored by lit lanterns launched skyward in the Thai festival of Yi Peng. It's a beautiful celebration, as you can see, and it happens around the second full moon at this time of year ('yi' means 'two' and 'peng' means 'full moon day'). Our photo shows the lanterns in Chiang Mai, Thailand's second-largest city and the home of the most famous Yi Peng observance, which has strong ties to the Lanna people of northern Thailand.
> 
> Yi Peng is a religious festival that also features entertainment and local traditional food. It is believed that sending lanterns up into the sky will honor the gods, and traditionally the release of lanterns has represented letting go of bad luck and wishing for good fortune. During the festival, lanterns or candles are also lit outside homes and businesses to show devotion to the Buddha.

> If you missed the first full lunar eclipse of the year back in May, you'll get another chance tonight as the second blood moon (as lunar eclipses are often called) of 2022 takes to the sky over the Pacific region. Tonight's display can be seen from Asia, Australia, North America, and parts of northern Europe and South America. If you're lucky enough to find yourself under a clear sky, the view might look something like this image, taken over Mount Crested Butte, Colorado, during the lunar eclipse of September 27, 2015.
> 
> A lunar eclipse is a happy accident of the solar system and is possible because of relative sizes of and distances between the sun, Earth, and moon. Every couple of years on average, the Earth casts a perfect shadow on the moon, causing a full lunar eclipse. During a full solar eclipse, the moon casts a perfect shadow on the Earth. While not as rare, and perhaps not quite as dramatic as a solar eclipse, lunar eclipses have plenty of upsides. For one, you can safely look at them without doing any harm to your eyes. They last for hours, while solar eclipses last minutes. And a lunar eclipse is visible from a much larger portion of the planet—in fact, the eclipsed moon can be seen at the time of the eclipse wherever the moon is above the horizon.
> 
> If you want to see tonight's lunar eclipse in the US, you'll likely have to sacrifice some sleep. Totality on the West Coast begins at 2:16 AM, 5:16 AM on the East Coast, and will last about 85 minutes. The next total lunar eclipse won't happen until March 2025, so a few hours of lost sleep seem a small price to pay for this dazzling view.

> The route for the 2022 New York City Marathon starts right here at the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, crossing from Staten Island into Brooklyn and eventually coursing through all five boroughs of New York. This photo gives you an idea just how many people will be running today. Because the race starts early on a November morning, many runners show up in layered clothing to beat the typical chill. But once they heat up from running, those layers come off and are often discarded on sidewalks. Race organizers collect the activewear left behind by 50,000 runners, about 26 tons a year, and donate it to charity.

> Fairy-tale castle? Check. Stunning Scottish backdrop? Check. Calm, tranquil loch? Check. If Tigh Mor looks idyllic to you, you're not alone. Queen Victoria spent time here in its heyday, and though the old hotel (it was built in 1849) declined over the years, a multimillion-dollar restoration has brought it right back to its former glory.
> 
> Tigh Mor sits above Loch Achray in Scotland's Trossachs, a region with scenery so stunning it draws artists and painters like moths to a flame. Writers are also inspired by its beauty: Way back in the early 1800s Sir Walter Scott's poem 'The Lady of the Lake' and novel 'Rob Roy' stirred interest in visiting this area of wooded glens, braes, and waterways called 'the Trossachs.'
> 
> Today many visitors hike or bike the Trossachs Trail, a beautiful 40-mile route that starts at Loch Lomond and winds along rivers and through woods, offering family-friendly adventures as well as challenges for mountain bikers and rock climbers. More of a water person? The Trossachs are also great for canoeing, kayaking, paddleboarding, sailing, swimming, and fishing on rivers and lochs aplenty.

<summary>Description</summary>

> A hundred years ago today, British archaeologist and Egyptologist Howard Carter discovered the sarcophagus of Tutankhamun, better known as King Tut, in Egypt's Valley of the Kings. Though they first uncovered the tomb of the 'boy king' on November 4, 1922, Carter and crew took years to excavate the burial site. What they found astonished the world. It was loaded with more than 5,000 artifacts, including a solid gold coffin, face mask, thrones, archery bows, trumpets, a lotus chalice, furniture, food, wine, sandals, gold caps to protect Tut's toes, and fresh linen underwear. Because you should always bring clean undies, even when you're crossing into the realm of the dead.
> 
> Though Tut is considered a minor pharaoh by historians, the discovery of his tomb was one of the most significant in the history of archaeology. The burial site was remarkably well preserved—unlike many neighboring tombs, it was untouched by grave robbers, thanks to debris covering the entrance for most of the tomb's existence. In the 1960s, Egypt allowed the treasures of King Tut to leave the country for display, and the exhibit has traveled the world numerous times. Today, King Tut's death mask and sarcophagus are displayed here at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.

> UNESCO designated November 3, 2022, the first annual International Day for Biosphere Reserves. Biosphere reserves are vast areas around the world used to promote biodiversity, cultural diversity, environmentally sustainable economic development, and research and education on how humans can coexist with nature.
> 
> The Amboseli Biosphere Reserve, which we feature today, is located on the Kenyan side of Mount Kilimanjaro and includes an amazing variety of ecological zones, including dry mountain forests, mountains, savannah rangelands, wetlands, and swamps. Elephants, lions, and giraffes make their home in the Amboseli. Designated a UNESCO biosphere reserve in 1980, Amboseli was a focus of a UN-sponsored program to ensure the long-term conservation of biodiversity in the area, partly by involving the local population in sustainable use.

After liftoff, it flew at 135 mph roughly 70 feet above the water. It cruised for about a mile for a whopping 26 seconds. 'I put the sweat of my life into this thing,' Hughes had said just a few months prior, vowing to leave the country if it was a failure. Failure is in the eye of the beholder, however, as Hughes never left and his spending of government funds was considered reasonable, because, technically, the Spruce Goose did fly.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
