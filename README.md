<summary>Description</summary>

> The rock arch formation you're looking at today is Heaven's Gate Cave, a popular landmark in Hunan province, China. This busy tourist destination is located on Tianmen (Heaven's Gate) Mountain in Tianmen Mountain National Park. To reach the arch, you must either ride a cable car or take a bus up a twisty, winding road with 99 turns. (The number 9 represents eternity in Chinese numerology.) Once off the bus, you'll need to walk 999 steps up a 45-degree incline—a stairway to the heavens. It's no easy feat, but this is no ordinary cave. At an elevation of 4,100 feet, the arch is 440 feet high and 180 feet wide.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we're wishing a very happy birthday to the man regarded as Scotland's national poet and a pioneer of the Romantic movement, Robert Burns. Perhaps you can celebrate by visiting his statue at the Birks of Aberfeldy in Perth and Kinross, as seen in today's photo. The birch trees here ('birks' in the Scots language) and a local waterfall inspired him to write a song lyric, 'The Birks of Aberfeldy,' in 1787.
> 
> You might also take part in Burns Night, a worldwide celebration that involves a lavish, multicourse dinner, a recital of Burns' 'Address to a Haggis,' and a serving of that poem's titular dish. After much discussion and several poetry readings, the night traditionally ends with guests singing the New Year's standard, 'Auld Lang Syne,' with words written by Burns himself in 1788.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This tiny hamlet on the slopes of the Dolomite Mountains is so picturesque, we'd understand if you mistook it for a movie set. But Colle Santa Lucia is a real village in Italy with about 400 residents. Despite its location in Italy's northern reaches, the village is more culturally Austrian than Italian, and is only a stone's throw from the Austrian border state of Tyrol. And like its Austrian neighbors, Colle Santa Lucia is known for its peaks and ski resorts. It has more in common with wintry Innsbruck than sunny Venice, which is less than 100 miles away to the south.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we're looking at something you may have heard about before—the famous Moai statues on Chile's remote Easter Island. These big-headed statues were carved out of solidified volcanic ash by the Rapa Nui people between 1250 and 1500, and there are nearly 1,000 of them on the island. Archaeologists believe they were meant to honor Rapa Nui ancestors and were revered as symbols of power and authority. All but seven of the statues face away from the surrounding Pacific Ocean, and instead look inward toward the villages, as if positioned to watch protectively over the Rapa Nui.

> Today is the start of the Lunar New Year, which ushers in the Year of the Rabbit. Those born under the sign of the rabbit are believed to be ingenious, sweet, happy, quiet, and persistent. Famous rabbits include Albert Einstein, Frank Sinatra, Lionel Messi, and Ingrid Bergman. The Lunar New Year celebration starts with the first new moon in January and goes for the next 15 days, until the year's first full moon lights up the night sky. Historically it has been an occasion for feasting and honoring deities as well as ancestors. We're doing our part by sharing this lovely winter image of a mountain hare in Derbyshire, England.

> Whether you call it a hug or an embrace, there is something about the power of touch that all mammals can relate to. Take this mommy kangaroo and her joey for example—no words are needed to convey what is going on in this image. Not only does this cute pair give us the warm and fuzzies, it's also a perfect visual for National Hugging Day, which we are celebrating today. This warm-hearted occasion was created in 1986 by a man named Kevin Zaborney, who chose Jan 21 because it fell after the run of year-end holidays, landing right in the middle of winter when spirits tend to be low. That makes perfect sense to us! After all, hugging has been an essential part of the human experience for thousands of years. And studies have shown that it reduces stress, too. So find yourself a willing partner today and hug it out. You'll feel better, we promise.

<summary>Description</summary>

> We're celebrating Penguin Awareness Day in the Falkland Islands, taking a stroll with some king penguins. Kings are the second-largest penguin species, only outranked in stature by their emperor penguin cousins. And while the kings' tuxedo coloring gives them a dash of the debonair, it also provides an important and more practical purpose: camouflage. When the birds dive deep into the ocean looking for food, their black feathers disguise the birds from predators above, while their white undersides do the reverse. Kings are legendary for their diving prowess—in their quest for tasty squid and lanternfish, they can dive to depths of 300 feet, and some have even been spotted nearly 1,000 feet beneath the surface. Underwater, these flightless birds are the epitome of grace. On land, however, they are not so graceful, and waddle or 'toboggan' on their bellies to get around.
