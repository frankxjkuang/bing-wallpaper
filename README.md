<summary>Description</summary>

> Atop Kelimutu, a volcano on the Indonesian island of Flores, sit three lakes, each with its own hue and folklore. Volcanic vents deep within the Earth release steam and gas that alter the lakes' mineral compositions, creating different colors, which can change independently. The westernmost lake, Tiwu Ata Bupu (Lake of Old People), not pictured, normally has a dark blue hue. Meanwhile, Tiwu Ko'o Fai Nuwa Muri (Lake of Young Men and Maidens), tends to be light green or light blue and Tiwu Ata Polo (Bewitched or Enchanted Lake) can be red, dark green, blue or brown. The local Lio people revere these lakes, believing them to be the resting place of souls.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh. This South Asian megacity on the Ganges Delta, home to over 10.2 million people, is one of the world's most densely populated cities. Dhaka has been nicknamed 'City of Mosques' because of the hundreds of elegant minarets that dot the city. Here, the cheers from football and cricket stadiums fill the air, and colorfully decorated rickshaws, recognized by UNESCO as an important example of cultural heritage, meander through the streets. Even by rickshaw, it might take you a while to reach your destination: Dhaka has been recognized as the world's slowest city. So, whether you're weaving through its alleys or sampling its spicy street foods, take the time to savor everything Dhaka has to offer.

> Fresh air, rustling leaves, and thousands of wildlife speciesâ€”welcome to the Amazon rainforest. Covering more than 2,100,000 square miles, this South America treasure extends its branches across nine nationsâ€”Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela. Today, the Amazon is home to more than 30 million people, but it also carries secrets of lost civilizations. Archaeologists recently discovered a network of cities here dating back 2,500 years.
> 
> However, deforestation has peeled away 20% of the Amazon's cover, jeopardizing local and global climates. This forest, housing an estimated 390 billion trees, has a critical cooling effect on the planet, absorbing and storing huge amounts of carbon dioxide. World Rainforest Day highlights the need for action to protect all rainforests and help these important ecosystems continue to play a vital role in the health of our planet.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today is about honoring the tallest creatures on Earth and highlighting the importance of conservation efforts. Giraffes have fascinated travelers from around the world for a long time. These animals were once viewed as status symbols and were treasured as pets among royalty.
> 
> Featured here are reticulated giraffes, found mostly in Kenya, but also in parts of Somalia and Ethiopia. Reticulated means to resemble a network or net, and these majestic creatures are named after their coats, which feature large spots that extend onto the lower legs, tail, and face. Only around 16,000 reticulated giraffes remain in the wild, less than half of those recorded in the 1980s. Nevertheless, in recent years there has been a promising trend in northern Kenya, where populations are rebounding thanks to places like the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy. So, let's pledge to protect these creatures and their habitats.

<summary>Description</summary>

> It's that time of year again when the daylight stretches long into the evening hours. Today is the longest day of the year, known as the summer solstice, which happens when one of the Earth's poles is most inclined toward the sun. Today's image features the Kokino megalithic observatory, part of a wider archaeological site in North Macedonia. It is believed that it marked the position of the sun during summer and winter solstices, as well as the equinox, and consists of two platforms. A stone block on the upper platform of the observatory indicates the summer solstice sunrise direction when seen from a seat on the lower platform. This Bronze Age astronomical wonder sits more than 3,300 feet above sea level, on a hill overlooking the hamlet of Kokino.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Juneteenth commemorates the end of slavery in the US. On June 19, 1865, Union troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, to enforce the Emancipation Proclamation issued by Abraham Lincoln. Juneteenth became a federal holiday in 2021, an acknowledgment of its indelible imprint on the country.
> 
> Today, we're featuring the New York mosaic 'Community,' by African American artist Jacob Lawrence. Lawrence was born in New Jersey to parents who, along with about 6 million African Americans, moved from the rural south to cities like New York City, Chicago, and Detroit during the Great Migration (1910-1970). He viewed the Black American experience as integral to American heritage and depicted its struggles and triumphs through vibrant, angular paintings, including his famed 'The Migration Series.' Lawrence was also inspired by the Harlem Renaissance, a revival of African American culture in the 1920s and 30s. His groundbreaking works broke racial barriers and continue to educate and inspire today.

<summary>Description</summary>

> As spring gives way to summer in Iceland, the rugged landscape bursts into color. Lupines were introduced here in the 1940s for their soil-binding properties, to reduce erosion. The plant flourishes in sandy and salty soils and spreads rapidly, bringing hues of purple, pink, and blue. Although some consider lupine to be a threat to native plants, it is welcomed by many as a cherished part of the summer landscape. You can find lupine fields in ReykjavÃ­k, near the SkÃ³gafoss waterfall, and lining the road to the Hellissandur Church in the SnÃ¦fellsnes Peninsula, as seen in today's image.

Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
