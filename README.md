> Think sea otters are just about whiskers and floating naps? There's more going on behind those button eyes. Every year, Sea Otter Awareness Week highlights their role in maintaining coastal ecosystems. Launched in 2003 by Defenders of Wildlife—a nonprofit conservation organization—this week promotes education and action. In Alaska's Prince William Sound, sea otters drift on ice or crack shellfish on their bellies using their favorite rock, as seen in today's image. Less visible is how their appetite for sea urchins helps protect kelp forests.
> 
> Often seen floating in 'rafts,' holding paws to stay connected, they appear serene—but their history tells a different story. Hunted extensively for their dense fur from 1741 to 1911, sea otters were pushed to the brink of extinction before rebounding through conservation. Still, dangers remain. Oil spills, fishing gear, disease, and warming oceans continue to threaten their survival. Otters rely on clean, cold water. Their fur isn't waterproof—it traps air for warmth, and any oil contamination can be fatal. This week serves as a call to notice them—and to protect the waters they call home.

> Every fall, Theresienwiese, a square in Munich, Germany, transforms into one of the world's largest festivals—Oktoberfest. First held in 1810 to celebrate a royal wedding, it has grown into a 16- to 18-day tradition attracting more than 6 million people from around the globe. The scale is staggering: The festival grounds span about 4.5 million square feet and host 14 main tents, each seating thousands. Each year, visitors consume around 7 million liters of beer, along with mountains of pretzels, sausages, and gingerbread hearts. All beer served at Oktoberfest comes from Munich breweries and meets the strict standards of the Reinheitsgebot, the German Beer Purity Law.
> 
> Beyond the drinks and food, the sprawling fairground is its own world, filled with roller coasters, games, and classic rides. Among them, the Wellenflug, the swing carousel pictured here, offers sweeping views of the festival grounds and the Munich skyline. This year, the festival begins today and runs through October 5. Whether you come for the beer, the pretzels, or the thrill of dangling your feet high above the city, Oktoberfest has a seat waiting for you.

<summary>Description</summary>

> When you hear 'Thousand Islands,' you might think of a jar of salad dressing, but the namesake of that creamy condiment is one of North America's most enchanting regions. The Thousand Islands form an archipelago in the St. Lawrence River, spanning the state of New York and the province of Ontario. It is made up of more than 1,800 islands. Some of these islands have fairytale castles; others are barely big enough for a hammock. There's also Just Room Enough Island, which lives up to its name with a single house and a lone tree.
> 
> The Thousand Islands are perfect for slow-paced exploration. Boat tours take you past grand estates and historic lighthouses, often stopping at landmarks like Boldt Castle and Singer Castle. Kayakers are drawn to the region's clear waters and serene coves. Thanks to a unique microclimate, local winemakers craft award-winning wines that are well worth sampling. Oh, and the salad dressing? Legend says a local fishing guide's wife first created it for dinner guests, including actress May Irwin, who enjoyed it so much that she asked for the recipe. The rest, as they say, is delicious history.

> This stunning view—where the sky meets the open waters of the Atlantic—is accessible only by foot. Tucked away on Ireland's wild and beautiful Dingle Peninsula, Dunquin Pier is one of the most photogenic spots in County Kerry. The small pier is famous for its winding, serpentine path that zigzags dramatically down the cliffside like a ribbon. These steep curves aren't just for the thrill—they're the only way to reach the pier below, where boats depart for the remote Blasket Islands.
> 
> The nearby village of Dunquin (Dún Chaoin in Irish) is Ireland's westernmost settlement, offering sweeping views and a deep connection to Irish heritage. With a population of just over 100, Dunquin is known for its strong Gaelic traditions, storytelling, and ties to the Blasket Island writers. Visitors often stop at the Blasket Centre, a cultural museum that tells the story of island life and emigration. Whether you're drawn by the dramatic landscape or the rich cultural heritage, Dunquin offers a uniquely Irish experience that feels both timeless and unforgettable.

> He may be young, but these antlers speak of future battles. In Denali National Park, Alaska, a young bull moose lifts his head above the shrubs. At this stage, his antlers are more crown than weapon—still covered in velvet. But even now, they hint at a life shaped by instinct, sparring, and the quiet pull of dominance.
> 
> Moose are the largest members of the deer family in North America, and mature bulls can top 1,500 pounds and reach nearly 7 feet at the shoulder. Their antlers grow at an astonishing pace—up to an inch a day in summer—only to be shed every winter, then regrown each spring. This young bull might not be ready to duel for territory or mates just yet, but rehearsal has already begun. He'll spar gently with others, learning how to move, how to hold his ground, how to rise in the ranks of the wild. Spotting moose in Denali is fairly common, but finding one mid-growth is something else entirely: a glimpse into the making of a giant. For now, there's no clash—just the quiet power of potential beneath Alaska's endless sky.

> What do invisible gases, vintage hairspray, and satellites have in common? They all played a role in one of the greatest environmental comebacks in history. Seen from 225 miles above, the Gulf Coast glows like a constellation—clusters of light scattered across the dark. But what truly makes this view possible can't be seen: the ozone layer, silently shielding everything below from the sun's ultraviolet rays. By the 1980s, that shield was thinning fast—damaged by chemicals once used in refrigeration and aerosol products. The solution? A global pact. The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, led to a swift phase-out of ozone-depleting substances. Today, satellites show that the hole over Antarctica is shrinking. Scientists believe it could be fully healed by mid-century.
> 
> On September 16, we mark the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer—a celebration of science, global cooperation, and collective will. It's a reminder that no molecule is too small to have a massive impact. But it's proof, too, that with the right action, even invisible damage can be undone.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
