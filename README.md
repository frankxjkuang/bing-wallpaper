<summary>Description</summary>

> On the National Mall in Washington, DC, just north of the Reflecting Pool, is a sculpture honoring the women who served during the Vietnam War. The military efforts of women, less visible than those of men, are commemorated by the Vietnam Women's Memorial, featured today on Veterans Day. While Memorial Day honors those who died during military service, Veterans Day recognizes the service of all veterans, whether or not they served during a war. Veterans Day, a federal holiday, was originally known as Armistice Day and coincides with the anniversary of the end of World War I. For this reason, other countries also observe today as a holiday.
> 
> The Vietnam Women's Memorial was officially dedicated on Veterans Day in 1993. During the Vietnam War, 265,000 American women volunteered to serve. About 11,000 were stationed in Vietnam, most as nurses. Women were not allowed to serve in combat roles then as they are now. It took decades before their contributions were publicly acknowledged with the addition of this memorial. It depicts three uniformed women tending to a wounded soldier and reminds us of the roles women played during this and other wars, often behind the scenes, as nurses, physicians, air traffic controllers, translators, and intelligence officers.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Forty-four years ago today, a rugged, inhospitable area of South Dakota was designated a national park to protect the many fossils found there. The region has a 12,000-year history as hunting grounds for Native Americans. In fact, the name we know it by today, Badlands, comes from the Lakota phrase 'mako sica,' which literally translates to 'bad lands.' Covering nearly 380 square miles, its harshly eroded rock formations make it one of the most distinct landscapes in the United States.
> 
> And it's still forming! The National Park Service says the Badlands erode about an inch every year, which is awfully fast as erosion goes. Scientists estimate that within the next half million years, the Badlands will have eroded away completely. Might want to start planning your visit soon.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Join us for a trip across the pond as we take a moment to examine the prickly European hedgehog. Our friend in today's photo is in Sussex, England, but European hedgehogs are widespread across the continent. They're thought to be the largest and heaviest of the hedgehog family. A nocturnal creature, the hedgehog can often be found in gardens snacking on its preferred diet of insects.
> 
> The European hedgehog is sometimes considered an invasive species. In New Zealand, for example, the hedgehog has no natural predators and threatens the food supply of native bush birds. But it's hard to blame such a cute little creature. With roughly 6,000 spines on its back, the hedgehog was, at one point, used as an unofficial symbol for NATO, chosen because it's a peaceful animal that has a rather pointed defense system.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The bright light of the full moon is mirrored by lit lanterns launched skyward in the Thai festival of Yi Peng. It's a beautiful celebration, as you can see, and it happens around the second full moon at this time of year ('yi' means 'two' and 'peng' means 'full moon day'). Our photo shows the lanterns in Chiang Mai, Thailand's second-largest city and the home of the most famous Yi Peng observance, which has strong ties to the Lanna people of northern Thailand.
> 
> Yi Peng is a religious festival that also features entertainment and local traditional food. It is believed that sending lanterns up into the sky will honor the gods, and traditionally the release of lanterns has represented letting go of bad luck and wishing for good fortune. During the festival, lanterns or candles are also lit outside homes and businesses to show devotion to the Buddha.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> If you missed the first full lunar eclipse of the year back in May, you'll get another chance tonight as the second blood moon (as lunar eclipses are often called) of 2022 takes to the sky over the Pacific region. Tonight's display can be seen from Asia, Australia, North America, and parts of northern Europe and South America. If you're lucky enough to find yourself under a clear sky, the view might look something like this image, taken over Mount Crested Butte, Colorado, during the lunar eclipse of September 27, 2015.
> 
> A lunar eclipse is a happy accident of the solar system and is possible because of relative sizes of and distances between the sun, Earth, and moon. Every couple of years on average, the Earth casts a perfect shadow on the moon, causing a full lunar eclipse. During a full solar eclipse, the moon casts a perfect shadow on the Earth. While not as rare, and perhaps not quite as dramatic as a solar eclipse, lunar eclipses have plenty of upsides. For one, you can safely look at them without doing any harm to your eyes. They last for hours, while solar eclipses last minutes. And a lunar eclipse is visible from a much larger portion of the planet—in fact, the eclipsed moon can be seen at the time of the eclipse wherever the moon is above the horizon.
> 
> If you want to see tonight's lunar eclipse in the US, you'll likely have to sacrifice some sleep. Totality on the West Coast begins at 2:16 AM, 5:16 AM on the East Coast, and will last about 85 minutes. The next total lunar eclipse won't happen until March 2025, so a few hours of lost sleep seem a small price to pay for this dazzling view.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The route for the 2022 New York City Marathon starts right here at the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, crossing from Staten Island into Brooklyn and eventually coursing through all five boroughs of New York. This photo gives you an idea just how many people will be running today. Because the race starts early on a November morning, many runners show up in layered clothing to beat the typical chill. But once they heat up from running, those layers come off and are often discarded on sidewalks. Race organizers collect the activewear left behind by 50,000 runners, about 26 tons a year, and donate it to charity.

> Fairy-tale castle? Check. Stunning Scottish backdrop? Check. Calm, tranquil loch? Check. If Tigh Mor looks idyllic to you, you're not alone. Queen Victoria spent time here in its heyday, and though the old hotel (it was built in 1849) declined over the years, a multimillion-dollar restoration has brought it right back to its former glory.
> 
> Tigh Mor sits above Loch Achray in Scotland's Trossachs, a region with scenery so stunning it draws artists and painters like moths to a flame. Writers are also inspired by its beauty: Way back in the early 1800s Sir Walter Scott's poem 'The Lady of the Lake' and novel 'Rob Roy' stirred interest in visiting this area of wooded glens, braes, and waterways called 'the Trossachs.'
> 
> Today many visitors hike or bike the Trossachs Trail, a beautiful 40-mile route that starts at Loch Lomond and winds along rivers and through woods, offering family-friendly adventures as well as challenges for mountain bikers and rock climbers. More of a water person? The Trossachs are also great for canoeing, kayaking, paddleboarding, sailing, swimming, and fishing on rivers and lochs aplenty.

After liftoff, it flew at 135 mph roughly 70 feet above the water. It cruised for about a mile for a whopping 26 seconds. 'I put the sweat of my life into this thing,' Hughes had said just a few months prior, vowing to leave the country if it was a failure. Failure is in the eye of the beholder, however, as Hughes never left and his spending of government funds was considered reasonable, because, technically, the Spruce Goose did fly.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
