> It's time to grab a trowel, roll up your sleeves, and get planting: National Gardening Week is starting today! Taking place in the first full week of June, this event was created by the National Garden Clubs, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the joys of horticulture. First celebrated in 1987 this week is all about getting more people involved in gardening and spreading awareness of how important gardens are. Being home to a wide range of trees, flowers, shrubs, and grasses, gardens can help the environment by absorbing carbon dioxide, filtering water, and encouraging insect life. Gardening clubs across the country celebrate this week by organizing workshops, visiting public gardens, or placing plants at public facilities. They're also great for people; tending to a garden is good exercise, and being outside in the sunshine is a great way to get more vitamin D. Gardening can even boost your mood, helping you to feel more relaxed and peaceful.

> June is Pride Month, commemorating the Stonewall uprising, a series of protests by the LGBTQIA+ community that took place on June 28, 1969, in response to a police raid at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village in New York City. Various events around the world are held in June to honor and celebrate the LGBTQIA+ community, their history, achievements, and ongoing pursuit for equality. This month, vibrant parades hit the streets, and buildings light up in the colors of the rainbow—a symbol of the LGBTQIA+ social movements—in numerous cities to praise freedom for all. Today's homepage shows the skyline of San Francisco, home to one of the largest and oldest Pride parades, with City Hall lit up in rainbow lights.

> In Yorkshire Dales National Park, the ancient village of Gunnerside is brimming with English charm and history. Picture yourself strolling through its narrow lanes, surrounded by rolling hills, lush pastures, and stone cottages, with the roar of the Swale River your only soundtrack. Designated in 1954, the national park is spread across 841 square miles, and there are over 1,000 farms in this area. One of the area's most distinctive features are its dry stone walls; built without any kind of mortar, they can last hundreds of years. There are thought to be over 5,000 miles of these walls in the Dales.
> 
> The village's name comes from 'Gunnar's saetr,' Old Norse for Gunnar's hill or pasture. The valley of Gunnerside Gill was a thriving center for the lead mining industry from the 17th to the 19th century. In the village, the Old Working Smithy & Museum, which is 229 years old, houses historic blacksmith tools and mining implements. Whether you're seeking a peaceful retreat or exploring England's storied past, Gunnerside beckons with a promise of unforgettable memories.

> On this day 90 years ago, Congress passed an act that would lead to the creation of one of America's natural gems: Everglades National Park in Florida. It would be another 13 years before enough land was acquired to make the park a reality but today, it encapsulates the largest subtropical wilderness in the US. Spanning more than 1.5 million acres, the park is a lifeline to 36 federally protected and endangered wildlife species, from the gentle manatee to the stealthy Florida panther. Here, the air thrums with the calls of over 350 bird species like limpkins and snail kites, while the waters teem with life including hundreds of species of fish, sea turtles, and American crocodiles. Beyond its biodiversity, the park is celebrated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, an International Biosphere Reserve, and a Wetland of International Importance. Here's to Everglades National Park—may it continue to inspire wonder, curiosity, and appreciation for the wild world around us.

> Playful, strong swimmers, and expert hunters—meet the otters. They come in 13 species of various shapes and sizes, from the sea otters found in coastal waters to the river otters frolicking in freshwater habitats. Seen in today's image is a Eurasian otter on the beautiful Isle of Mull off the west coast of Scotland. With webbed feet, streamlined bodies, and dense fur coats, otters are built for speed and agility underwater. They can dive deep and hold their breath for several minutes.
> 
> From habitat loss and pollution to being hunted for their fur, these whiskered wonders are struggling to survive out in the wild. That's where World Otter Day, on the last Wednesday in May, comes in. It's our chance to raise awareness about the challenges otters face and what we can do to help protect our environment.

Roussanou is one of the six monasteries that remain active in this UNESCO World Heritage Site. Despite the construction difficulties, 24 monasteries were founded on these 'columns of the sky' in the 14th and 15th centuries.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today, as we observe Memorial Day, we pay tribute to the courageous individuals who gave their lives to defend our nation and uphold its values. The origins of this day date back to the 1860s, in the years following the Civil War and the first national observance was held in 1868. However, one of the earliest accounts is from October 1864, when three women in Boalsburg, Pennsylvania, placed flowers at the graves of two Union soldiers. They decided to decorate the graves of all the fallen soldiers and returned to do the same the following year.
> 
> While Memorial Day is a moment to remember the sacrifices of our armed forces, it also marks the unofficial beginning of the summer season. The long weekend offers families the perfect opportunity to get together for picnics, barbecues, and beach trips. Memorial Day is a celebration of patriotism, unity, and gratitude and reminds us that freedom is not free.

Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
