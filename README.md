<summary>Description</summary>

> Color, creativity, and fun are three things that go along with being a kid, so what better way to illustrate World Children's Day than with this huge (we're talking more than 100,000 square feet!) piece of 'land art' in New York City, painted by the French-Swiss artist known as Saype. Gifted to the United Nations by Switzerland in honor of the UN's 75th anniversary, 'World in Progress II,' shows two children busily drawing and using origami to create their ideal world.
> 
> World Children's Day launched in 1954 as Universal Children's Day, and it's always celebrated on November 20, the date in 1959 when the UN adopted the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. The day is meant to focus global attention on improving the lives of children around the world, and to foster equality and inclusion among the youngest generation. After all, children are our future!

> Our photo brings us to a 16-mile stretch of the Virgin River where it cuts a spectacular thousand-foot-deep gorge through the upper reaches of Utah's Zion Canyon. Flowing through Zion National Park (which turns 103 today!), the Virgin River is home to unique plants and animals that aren't found anywhere else, due to the unique intersection of biomes found where the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert all meet. Without the water of the Virgin River system, creatures like the woundfin minnow, one of rarest species on the planet, couldn't exist.

> The International Day of Islamic Art, proclaimed by UNESCO in 2019, occurs every November 18 to celebrate past and contemporary artistic expressions of Islam, and to highlight Islamic artists' contributions to world civilization. November 18 also marks Morocco's independence day, commemorating Sultan Muhammad V's return to Morocco from exile in November 1955.
> 
> Our image honors both of today's events: You're beholding the main gates of the Dar al-Makhzen, the royal palace of the King of Morocco in the city of Fez. While the palace was originally founded in 1276, these ornate gates were added in the 1960s and '70s, crafted of wood and bronze—plus intricate mosaic tiling, a hallmark of Islamic art both old and new.

> It's National Take a Hike Day, so what better time to lace up those boots and head out on a trail to pay homage to John Muir, the patron saint (not really) of US hiking. Muir was instrumental in persuading the government that enjoying nature is the right of every American and that there should be an official national park system. He saw the spectacular beauty of the American West when he walked through the Sierra Nevada in California, and was passionate about preserving the country's national wonders. In 1892, Muir founded the Sierra Club, an environmental organization that protects wild lands to this day.
> 
> The US boasts more than 60,000 miles of national trails, and you can choose coastal paths or mountain climbs, forest meanders or historical walks like Boston's Freedom Trail. Our photo shows Oregon's McKenzie River National Recreation Trail, part of the Willamette National Forest. This trail winds by lakes, rivers, and springs, guiding you through shady old-growth forests. One highlight: the view overlooking Tamolitch Blue Pool, a crystal-clear pool created by the river bubbling up into it.

> At its World Heritage Convention on November 16, 1972, UNESCO adopted an international treaty that for the first time linked the concepts of nature conservation and preservation of cultural properties. The World Heritage Sites program was sparked by Egypt's plans to construct the Aswan High Dam. UNESCO helped save thousands of antiquities that would have been lost as a result of the dam, which flooded a large swath of the Nile Valley.

> You 'otter' know something about the creatures in today's photo. They're a pair of North American river otters swimming in Maine's Acadia National Park. Technically members of the weasel family, these 'water dogs' aren't just locked into rivers. They can be found in other waterways and along the coasts of North America. A myopic animal with eyesight adapted to help with swimming, river otters will come right up on humans or boats, usually within a few feet.
> 
> They're active year-round, though they tend to do most of their business at night, which primarily consists of hunting and eating. River otters are highly active predators, usually going after fish, but they have been known to munch on fruit, reptiles, ducks, and even the rare beaver. River otters are highly sensitive to pollution, so will tend to disappear from tainted areas. Scientists value them as trusted bioindicators of the environments where they live due to the way their bodies accumulate various chemical compounds.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Halki, a tiny Greek island in the Aegean Sea, is the type of place you go to when you need a getaway from your getaway. Off the beaten path, Halki is quiet and sleepy when other Greek islands are flush with visitors. The only way to arrive is by ferry. Halki, with a total area of just 11 sun-kissed square miles, is the smallest inhabited island in the Dodecanese island group.
> 
> One of the most popular attractions on Halki is the ruins of this medieval castle built by the Knights of St. John in the 14th century in the now abandoned village of Chorio on the island's south-facing shore. It's a short, uphill walk from the only town on the island, the port village of Emporio, where most of the island's few hundred permanent residents live. A significant portion of the population left in the mid-20th century, many of them settling in the Gulf Coast town of Tarpon Springs, Florida, which lays claim to having the highest percentage of Greek Americans of any US city. People from Halki and other Greek islands were lured to Tarpon Springs to work as sponge divers, a skill they honed for generations in Greece. These days, not much goes on in Halki beyond eating, relaxing, and swimming. Like all Greek islands, Halki has beautiful beaches. Here, you're more likely to have them all to yourself.

'I put the sweat of my life into this thing,' Hughes had said just a few months prior, vowing to leave the country if it was a failure. Failure is in the eye of the beholder, however, as Hughes never left and his spending of government funds was considered reasonable, because, technically, the Spruce Goose did fly.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
