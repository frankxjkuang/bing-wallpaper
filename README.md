<summary>Description</summary>

> Each January 25, Scots and friends around the world raise a toast to Robert Burns, Scotland's beloved national poet. A Burns Night supper blends warmth and wit: the centerpiece is haggis, a savory pudding made from minced meat, oats, and spices, served with neeps (mashed turnips) and tatties (mashed potatoes). Add plenty of good cheer, readings of Burns's verse, and a dram of whisky, and you have a celebration that ends with a rousing chorus of 'Auld Lang Syne.' Even if you're celebrating stateside, these traditions are easy to adopt—set the table, cue the poetry, and let the toasts flow.
> 
> In Ayr, Ayrshire, the Burns National Heritage Park anchors the festivities where they began. Here you can step inside the thatched cottage where Burns was born, explore the museum’s manuscripts, and stroll to the Brig o' Doon, a graceful 15th-century stone bridge immortalized in his poem 'Tam o' Shanter,' and the Auld Kirk, a haunting old church that inspired the same tale. Together, these landmarks turn a visit into a story you can walk. Whether you join a local ceilidh—a lively Scottish social gathering with traditional music and dancing—or simply pass the haggis with friends, Burns Night is about community, humor, and heartfelt words that still travel far.

<summary>Description</summary>

> When January's chill grips Iceland, locals turn to warmth and tradition with Þorrablót—a midwinter festival rooted in Viking heritage. Named after Þorri, a winter figure from Norse mythology, this celebration began as a sacrificial feast to honor the gods and ensure survival through harsh winters. Today, it's a lively cultural event that blends history with hearty camaraderie.
> 
> At the heart of Þorrablót is food—quirky, preserved dishes that once sustained Icelanders through long, dark months. Expect a buffet of smoked lamb, dried fish, and rye bread alongside more daring bites like hákarl (fermented shark), svið (singed sheep's head), and even ram testicles. These flavors, still softened by traditional preservation methods, tell stories of resilience. To wash it down? A shot of Brennivín, Iceland's signature spirit, distilled from potatoes and flavored with caraway seeds.
> 
> Beyond the feast, Þorrablót is about gathering—singing old songs, reciting epic poems, and sharing laughter in community halls. It's a celebration of heritage, humor, and togetherness, turning the coldest season into a warm embrace of Icelandic culture.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In today's image, winter settles over Karlovy Vary in Czechia, a pastel valley that built its identity around the hot springs rising through its hills. The eponymous city traces its beginnings to accounts of Charles IV, then king of Bohemia (a historic region of Czechia) and later Roman Emperor, encountering a steaming pool here in the 14th century, an early moment that set this quiet part of Bohemia on the path to becoming a spa retreat.
> 
> As the town expanded along the Teplá and Ohře rivers, its character took shape: long colonnades, ornate facades, and riverside hotels that reflected a calm, deliberate rhythm. Visitors from across Europe—aristocrats, writers, composers—came for the warm springs and the slower pace they offered, giving the city a personality rooted in routine, architecture, and water.
> 
> That steady link to wellness earned Karlovy Vary a place among the Great Spa Towns of Europe in 2021, a UNESCO group recognizing historic resort cities shaped by natural springs. Even in winter, the city holds a quiet confidence, its story still anchored to the water that first drew people into this valley.

> Today's image shows a Eurasian red squirrel perched in the snow, displaying the winter fur and tufted ears that make this species so striking. Native to forests across Europe and parts of Asia, red squirrels rely on seeds, nuts, and fungi, stashing food in scattered caches and building nests high in hollow trees to survive the colder months.
> 
> Squirrel Appreciation Day, observed on January 21, began in 2001 when wildlife rehabilitator Christy Hargrove encouraged people to show more kindness toward these quick, bright-eyed foragers. Despite their reputation as garden raiders or urban 'nuisances,' squirrels play essential roles in local ecosystems. Their tendency to bury food and forget some of it helps forests regenerate, especially in areas where conifer seeds spread through these accidental plantings.
> 
> In the United States, this day highlights the adaptability of these animals, thriving in forests, city parks, and suburban landscapes wherever shelter and scattered food sources exist.

> Penguins thrive in some of Earth's coldest waters. Today's image shows a gentoo penguin beneath a vault of shimmering blue ice, its sharp silhouette etched against the frozen world around it. Penguin Awareness Day, observed on January 20, shines a spotlight on the birds that bring life, noise, and personality to Earth's iciest coastlines.
> 
> The gentoo is among the most agile swimmers of all penguins. With strong flippers and a sleek, tapered build, it can navigate icy waters with quick, confident bursts of speed. Its bright bill, bold white head stripe, and upright posture make it instantly recognizable, even in colonies where thousands of birds gather along the shore.
> 
> Many gentoos gather on Petermann Island, a rocky outpost off the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, shaped by volcanic cliffs, wind-carved ledges, and snow-dusted beaches. The island's exposed rock provides nesting space for breeding pairs. Surrounding waters sustain the busy routines of feeding, preening, and raising chicks in tightly packed groups—animating the stark polar landscape.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In the summer heat of 1963, a quarter of a million people gathered at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, for one of the largest demonstrations in our history. Segregation still dictated where people could live, learn, vote, and work; the nation simmered with tension—and the world was watching. At that moment, Martin Luther King, Jr. stepped forward, a Baptist minister and the strategic heart of the civil rights movement. He fought injustice with discipline, clarity, and nonviolent resolve, delivering a vision that reshaped the nation's imagination: a future where freedom was real, dignity was universal, and justice extended to all.
> 
> Today we celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day, observed on the third Monday of January. The holiday honors his birth and the impact of his work, from the Montgomery Bus Boycott to the Selma marches. These victories challenged legalized discrimination and paved the way for landmark civil rights legislation. The day is both a tribute and a call to action: progress must be relentlessly built, protected, and pushed forward—and King's legacy urges every generation to push the nation closer to the dream he dared to dream aloud.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
