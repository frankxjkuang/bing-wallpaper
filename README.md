> The Turku Cathedral rises above the frosted forests near the mouth of the Aura River, which runs through the middle of Turku, Finland.
> 
> Originally built out of wood in the late 13th century, the cathedral was expanded in the 14th and 15th centuries, mainly using stone as construction material. Despite this, it was badly damaged in the Great Fire of Turku, which consumed much of the city in 1827. The cathedral was rebuilt over the next few years.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This fuzzy donkey feeding on the leaves of a cherry tree probably doesn't know that today was once celebrated as the Feast of the Donkey. We think any day is a good day to celebrate donkeys. They've carried the load for humans for more than 7,000 years, so let's give them some love. More than 40 million donkeys do the heavy lifting around the world today, with 11 million in China alone.
> 
> Medieval Christians celebrated January 14 as the Feast of the Donkey, or Feast of the Ass—acknowledging the importance of donkeys in the Bible. The passage of Mary, Joseph, and their newborn son into Egypt was usually depicted with Mary and her child riding on a donkey. The festival fell out of favor by the 15th century.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> All along the Pacific Coast of North America, giant stands of kelp up to 100 feet high, like this one in California's Channel Islands, provide habitat for a vast number of fish, invertebrates, and sea mammals. Giant kelp, technically a type of brown algae, is the largest of all seaweed and one of the fastest-growing of any organism—as much as 2 feet per day! The gas-filled pods you see in this image help the kelp float. Like the trees in the Amazon, the kelp forests of our oceans are key to the health of marine life.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Though Türkiye usually lives up to expectations as a warm Mediterranean country, snow occasionally falls here. This winter dusting of Istanbul, Türkiye's largest city, brings into sharper focus the lines of Rumelihisarı in the center of our image. The structure, also known as Rumeli Fortress, was built in the 15th century by an Ottoman sultan as a way to choke naval traffic through the narrow Bosporus Strait. The Bosporus connects the Sea of Marmara to the Black Sea, separating Istanbul into what are often referred to as its 'European side' and 'Asian side.' Today, the fortress isn't used to fire upon ships but serves as a museum and concert venue. While the place has changed over the centuries, the killer view hasn't.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Making a New Year's resolution to boost your fitness? Let us present National Take the Stairs Day. (You're welcome.) The annual event began informally in 2016 and was later adopted by the American Lung Association. It's an ingenious way to nudge people to exercise—most of us encounter stairs during our day, so there's really no excuse. Climbing stairs is a low-impact activity that raises your heart rate and burns calories.
> 
> Of course, you may not have access to a cool, curly staircase like this beauty, which is actually a sculpture rather than a conduit. 'Umschreibung' is tucked away in an office building complex in Munich's Schwanthalerhöhe district. Creator Olafur Eliasson says he intended the sculpture—known locally as 'The Stairway to Heaven'—to convey 'movement without destination, a space defined by motion rather than walls.' Mission accomplished.

> Lake Peipus, the fifth-largest lake in Europe, dates back hundreds of millions of years to the Paleozoic Era and is known for its sand dunes, which can 'sing' when the wind blows just right. In the winter the frozen lake surface may feature ice hummocks, as seen in this image. The hummocks are caused by slow, uneven pressure in the ice pack.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Between the more famous national parks of Yellowstone and the Badlands lies Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota. Established 120 years ago, this national park is home to one of only four wild herds of genetically pure bison in North America. The two in our image are the descendants of 20 bison saved from slaughter by conservationists in the early 1900s. At the time, fewer than 1,000 wild bison were left alive out of a population that once numbered 50 million. Above ground, the park is the largest grass prairie in the country. Below ground lies one of the most extensive cave systems in the world. As the weather above changes, air flows into and out of the caves creating the wind for which the park was named.
