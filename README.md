<summary>Description</summary>

> Every August, Edinburgh stops being just a city and starts acting up—literally. From pub basements to park benches, stages appear in the strangest places, and shows pop up on quiet streets. Welcome to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, or the Fringe. The story began in 1947, when eight theater groups turned up uninvited to the Edinburgh International Festival. They performed anyway. That spirit of rebellion stuck, and the Fringe was born.
> 
> Now it's the world's largest arts festival, with thousands of shows crammed into three action-packed weeks. Anyone can perform. If you have an idea and a venue, you're in. Even a shipping container counts—yes, that really happened. Comedy is the unofficial king of the festival, but there's also drama, dance, drag, musicals, magic, mime, spoken word, circus, and acts that defy all categories. One year, a man did an hour-long monologue from inside a fridge. Another year featured a full Shakespeare play in Klingon. Street performers flood the Royal Mile, pictured here, offering sneak peeks, juggling acts, and flyers.  The Edinburgh Festival Fringe is where experimental performances and high-end theater thrive. It has launched careers: think of artists like Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Eddie Izzard.

> It looks like this small creature is playing a game, right? But when a baby ring-tailed lemur wraps its tail around or gives it a tug, it's actually working on crucial skills. The infants spend their early weeks hanging tight to their mom, first clinging to her belly, and later to her back. As they grow, they separate from their mom, and tail-chasing becomes part of how they learn balance, coordination, and group play. These primates use their long tails for communication as well. Raised like flags during group movement, the tails help them stick together in open terrain. Loud, rhythmic calls, scent markings, and 'stink fights' between males add to the social drama.
> 
> Ring-tailed lemurs are found only in southern and southwestern Madagascar, where they live in dry forests, spiny thickets, and rocky outcrops. They live in female-dominated groups, sometimes up to 30 individuals. Habitat loss due to slash-and-burn agriculture and charcoal production has pushed them into vulnerable status, despite being one of the most studied lemurs.

> What do giant handshakes painted on the ground have to do with friendship? Quite a lot, actually. Celebrated every July 30, the International Day of Friendship reminds us that tackling global challenges, like poverty, violence, and injustice, starts with something surprisingly simple: human connection. That's exactly what artist Saype had in mind with 'Beyond Walls,' a series of massive, biodegradable land-art murals featuring interlinked hands. Symbolizing unity and solidarity, these works have stretched across five continents. At Expo 2020 Dubai, Saype's 11th installation covered over 16,000 square feet of grass in Al Forsan Park. It formed a striking black-and-white handshake that could only be fully appreciated from above, as seen here. The piece, made with eco-friendly paint, was unveiled on Switzerland's National Day, supported by the Swiss Pavilion.
> 
> Proclaimed by the UN in 2011, the International Day of Friendship calls for building bonds across borders, cultures, and generations. It's a vision of peace crafted not just in policy rooms but also on playgrounds, in neighborhoods, and in public spaces—even on the ground itself. So, today, take a cue from Saype: reach out, connect, and be part of a global human chain. Sometimes, the most powerful message begins with a single gesture.

> Think you can hear silence? Try sitting in a jeep in Kanha National Park in the heart of India, waiting for a Bengal tiger to appear. Every year, International Tiger Day draws attention to these powerful yet endangered big cats. Bengal tigers are more than their unmistakable orange coats and black stripes. They are apex predators, essential to the health and balance of the ecosystems they inhabit. By keeping prey populations like deer and wild boar in check, tigers help shape vegetation patterns and support the overall biodiversity of their environments.
> 
> One of the best places to see this delicate natural balance in action is Kanha National Park. Among India's oldest protected areas, it was first declared a reserve forest in 1879 and later a national park in 1955. It then became one of the first nine tiger reserves under Project Tiger in 1973, a landmark initiative launched to halt the steep decline in the species. Yet, despite decades of progress, tigers still face threats from habitat fragmentation, poaching, and conflict with humans. That's why landscapes like Kanha remain critical—not just for tigers, but for the future of forests and wildlife conservation across the planet.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Every July 28, World Nature Conservation Day reminds us that protecting nature isn't optional—it's essential. Mongolia's vast grasslands, featured today, are a powerful example. These ecosystems are among the largest intact temperate grasslands on Earth, stretching across millions of acres of open steppe. They support around 200,000 nomadic herder families and provide habitat for rare species like the Mongolian gazelle and snow leopard.
> 
> While the day isn't tied to a single founding organization, it aligns with the mission of global conservation leaders like the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which has worked to protect biodiversity since 1948. That mission lives on across Mongolia's open steppe, where nomadic herder families still live in traditional white yurts that dot the grasslands like part of the ecosystem itself. Here, nature isn't just a backdrop—it's home. And Mongolia's grasslands show how people and wildlife can thrive together when ecosystems are respected and protected.

> Being surrounded by a shimmering spiral of silver—that's what it feels like to encounter a school of blackfin barracuda at Shark Reef in Ras Mohammed National Park, Egypt. These streamlined fish, marked by sharp V-shaped stripes, move in near-perfect unison. Their slow, deliberate spirals aren't random—they're an evolutionary strategy that offers both safety in numbers and an edge in hunting. Blackfin barracudas are found throughout tropical waters, from the Red Sea to the central Pacific. During the day, they gather in tight, coordinated groups near the reef, scattering at dusk to pursue prey.
> 
> Ras Mohammed, at the southern tip of Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, is known for much more than striking fish formations. As the country's first marine protected area, it shelters over 1,000 fish species and more than 200 types of coral. The park is considered a living archive of ecological complexity, where even a fleeting school of barracuda reveals a deeper story of life beneath the surface.

> As twilight descends on Walakiri Beach on the island of Sumba, Indonesia, the silhouettes of mangrove trees stand like sentinels in the tide—graceful, resilient, and vital. Today, on International Day for the Conservation of the Mangrove Ecosystem, we honor these extraordinary trees and the critical role they play in sustaining life on our planet.
> 
> Mangroves are nature's coastal guardians. With their arching and salt-filtering roots, they thrive where few trees can—anchored in brackish water, enduring tides and shifting sands. They protect shorelines from erosion, buffer communities against storms, and serve as nurseries for countless marine animals. Their tangled root systems not only stabilize sediment but also provide shelter for juvenile fish, crabs, and birds. Mangroves also trap carbon at rates far higher than most forests, making them powerful allies in the fight against climate change. Yet they are disappearing at an alarming rate due to development, pollution, and rising sea levels. Let this day be a call to action. Whether through education, restoration, or advocacy, we all have a role in preserving these vital ecosystems. Because when we protect mangroves, we protect the future.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
