<summary>Description</summary>

> At the heart of the Orkney Islands, an archipelago in northern Scotland, lies an ancient riddle: the Ring of Brodgar. Dating back to sometime between 2500 and 2000 BCE, this Neolithic henge—a type of ancient circular earthwork—and stone circle measure about 340 feet across. Lying on a narrow strip of land between two lochs, the site initially comprised 60 stones, although today only 36 remain. The exact purpose of the structure is still unknown, despite an excavation project at the site in 2008. In 1999, the Heart of Neolithic Orkney group of monuments, which includes the Ring of Brodgar, was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. If you are planning a trip to Scotland, consider walking amid the echoes of history at the Ring of Brodgar while the crisp Scottish air embraces you.

> Happy International Day for Monuments and Sites! Also called World Heritage Day, the event highlights efforts to conserve our cultural heritage. Some of the amazing heritage sites around the world include Machu Picchu in Peru and the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt. The stone structure in today's image is part of the medieval city walls of Ávila in Spain. Built between the 11th and 14th centuries to defend the city against attack, these fortifications stretch for 1.5 miles around Ávila. Nowadays, visitors can walk around sections of the walls, enjoying views of the city and the surrounding countryside.

> Welcome to the world, bear cub! After spending the first months of its life inside the den, this little American black bear may be puzzled by the outside world. The cubs are born between January and February and emerge from their dens in the spring, weighing around 5 pounds. By their first birthday, they can grow to about 80 pounds. However, their weight—which ranges between 100 and 600 pounds for adults—depends on their age, sex, the season, and food available in their area. Black bears are the only bears found in Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, which provides the setting for today's image.

> 'These streets will make you feel brand new, big lights will inspire you.' Alicia Keys sure knows how to serenade the vibrant, bustling life of the Big Apple. Today's homepage image takes us to Union Square in lower Manhattan. At this historic intersection, you can find statues of George Washington—the oldest statue in any park in NYC—and Abraham Lincoln, crafted by the sculptor Henry Kirke Brown. In 1882, workers exercised their rights to free speech and assembly, organizing the first Labor Day parade here. In 1997, Union Square was recognized as a National Historic Landmark due to its importance in US labor history. These days, you're more likely to see street chess players, musicians, skateboarders, dance crews, and vendors of all types in the square.

> 'Art is the queen of all sciences communicating knowledge to all the generations of the world.' Let’s ponder these inspirational words by Leonardo da Vinci on World Art Day, April 15, which was also the birthday of the renowned Renaissance artist. From his iconic painting of the Mona Lisa to his detailed sketches of flying machines, Leonardo pushed the boundaries of knowledge and talent in a wide range of fields. Today's homepage shows the RedBall Project at Centraal Station in Antwerp, Belgium. Created by the American artist Kurt Perschke, this traveling public art installation is considered to be the world's longest-running street artwork. Since 2001, the 15-foot inflated red ball has been wedged into dozens of landmarks in countries from Australia to England.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to nature's bowling alley. Bowling Ball Beach on the Mendocino Coast in California is named after the striking rock formations strewn across the shore. These sandstone balls—a phenomenon known as concretions—formed over millions of years as sedimentary layers built up around a central core of sand and stone held together by mineral cements. Erosion gradually wore away the outer layers to expose the spherical shapes we see today. This created a fascinating spectacle that only appears at low tide. Concretions are rare, and there has been plenty of wild speculation about where they come from, with some believing them to be extraterrestrial debris while others wondering if they are dinosaur fossils. The answer, however, is quite simple: it is the forces of nature at play.
