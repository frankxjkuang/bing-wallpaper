<summary>Description</summary>

> Not far from São Miguel Island in the Azores archipelago of Portugal, you'll find Vila Franca Islet. This uninhabited green islet sits quietly just south of the town of Vila Franca do Campo. Beneath its serene surface, this gem holds a lively past. First documented in 1537, around the time when settlers from São Miguel began expanding westward, Vila Franca Islet has played many roles throughout its history. It has served as a military fort, a port, a vineyard site, and even a lookout for whale-watching.
> 
> Once a volcanic crater, this islet is now a protected nature reserve teeming with unique marine life, including bird species like Bulwer's petrel, little egret, and sooty tern. The unique shape of this tiny island, sculpted by nature, makes it truly special. At its heart lies an almost perfectly circular lagoon, linked to the sea by a narrow channel called Boquete. Since the opening faces north toward São Miguel, it shields the lagoon from ocean waves and forms a calm natural harbor with a sandy beach. It's no wonder the spot is a favorite for swimmers: from June to October, ferries run daily between the town and the islet. Access is limited to 400 visitors a day—do you want to be one of them?

<summary>Description</summary>

> They say everything's bigger in Texas—and Big Bend National Park has been living up to the slogan since forever. Efforts to preserve this 801,163-acre area of West Texas began in the 1930s and culminated in its official designation as a park on June 12, 1944. Big Bend remains one of the most remote and least-visited national parks in the country. It's not just one landscape, it's three: the Chihuahuan Desert, the Chisos Mountains (pictured here), and the Rio Grande. Big Bend sits on the US–Mexico border, and its history reflects that blend. Indigenous peoples, Spanish explorers, ranchers, miners, and modern travelers have all left their footprints. Petroglyphs, ruins, and old trails show the land's story began long before it became a park.
> 
> The park is home to over 1,200 species of plants, more than 450 species of birds, and a wide variety of mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. You might spot a roadrunner zipping across the dirt, or a bobcat silently slipping through the underbrush. Additionally, it has been designated as one of the best dark-sky parks in America, offering views of the Milky Way, planets, and constellations.

> In Lüderitz, Namibia, these birds aren't just passing through—they're standing their ground. Literally. On one leg. These long-legged locals, the greater flamingos, bring a splash of pink to Namibia's windswept Atlantic coast. These birds are the largest of their kind, and they're not shy about showing off. Towering up to 59 inches tall with spoon-shaped bills and stilt-like legs, they're easy to spot.
> 
> That bubblegum pink hue? That's all diet. Flamingos feed on algae, crustaceans, and tiny invertebrates packed with carotenoids—the same pigments that make carrots orange. The more they eat, the pinker they get. In other words, they're what they eat, right down to the blush. In the air, flamingos are sleek flyers, cruising long distances in a V-formation. Their migration habits are still being studied, but it's clear they go where the wetlands flow—from inland salt pans to coastal sanctuaries, always in search of food and safe nesting zones.

> Wouldn't it be great to see our reflection from above in this vast expanse of water? Everglades National Park, located in Florida, is the largest tropical wilderness in the United States, spanning more than 1.5 million acres. It protects the southern 20% of the original Everglades and is home to numerous rare and endangered species, including the Florida panther, American crocodile, and West Indian manatee. Often referred to as 'River of Grass,' the park's unique ecosystem, fed by a slow-moving river from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay, is a significant breeding ground for tropical wading birds. Everglades National Park is not only a national treasure but also an international one, recognized as a World Heritage Site, an International Biosphere Reserve, and a Wetland of International Importance.
> 
> The park also plays a crucial role in water conservation and flood control, as its wetlands serve as natural filters and buffers against storms. Efforts to preserve and restore the Everglades are ongoing, with numerous initiatives aimed at combating invasive species, improving water quality, and protecting wildlife habitats.

<summary>Description</summary>

> There is something mesmerizing about cities that wear their history on their sleeves—and Dubrovnik, Croatia, is one of them. Once known as the independent Republic of Ragusa, this city was a major maritime power and trading hub from the 14th to the 19th century. Situated in southern Dalmatia along the Adriatic Sea, its success was built on diplomacy and seafaring. The Walls of Dubrovnik, built between the 13th and 17th centuries, stretch for over 1.2 miles, with towers, forts, and bastions still standing strong. The current layout of the walls follows a city plan from 1292, when Dubrovnik was rebuilt after a fire under Venetian rule.
> 
> Inside these walls is the Old City—a compact grid of polished limestone streets, baroque churches, and centuries-old residences. Everything here, including the 15th-century Rector's Palace, Sponza Palace, and the Church of St. Blaise, reflects the city's independent past. The Franciscan Monastery, Europe's oldest still operating pharmacy, adds another layer of charm to this vintage place. Dubrovnik might seem familiar. That's because it has represented the cities of King's Landing and Qarth in 'Game of Thrones,' putting it on the pop culture map. It's not just a touristy location—it's a city that has been writing its own script for over a thousand years.

> You can't talk about life on Earth without talking about the ocean. This year, World Oceans Day is being celebrated in Nice, France, just ahead of the UN Ocean Conference starting tomorrow. Officially recognized by the United Nations since 2008, it began as an idea at the 1992 Global Forum, a parallel event at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. This year's theme is 'WONDER: Sustaining What Sustains Us.' It highlights how the ocean supports life as we know it—influencing weather, food chains, and economies.
> 
> Off the coast of Vancouver Island in Canada, Steller sea lions glide through chilly waters, as seen in today's image. These marine mammals are heavy—females average 580 pounds, while males are around 1,200 pounds. Males are noticeably larger than females and are known for their loud roars, thick necks, and flatter snouts. Their deep vocalizations include belching, growling, and snorting to warn others and communicate underwater. Males get loud to defend turf, while moms and pups use unique calls to find each other in a crowded rookery. Despite their size, they're preyed on by orcas and large sharks. These sea lions are considered near-threatened, with populations declining in parts of Alaska. Ocean conservation keeps them—and countless other mammals—afloat.

> Today, we celebrate the paths that connect us with nature and adventure. Angeles National Forest in Southern California is home to towering pines and rugged ridgelines, and hosts a stretch of the legendary Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). Winding over about 2,650 miles from Mexico to Canada, the PCT is the ultimate thru-hiking dream. Designated a National Scenic Trail in 1968, it traverses seven national parks, 25 national forests, and provides a unique lens through which to experience the dramatic landscapes of the American West. But you don't need to go the distance to enjoy its magic. In Southern California, portions of the trail through the San Gabriel Mountains offer great views and rewarding day hikes.
> 
> This year, National Trails Day isn't just about adventure, it's also about stewardship. These trails need our love and care to stay wild and walkable. So, bring a trash bag, join a cleanup drive, or just spread the word about keeping trails pristine and thriving for generations to come.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
