> What's the perfect thing to do under the midnight sun? If you're a walrus, the answer might be taking a quick dip with your crew, chowing down on clams and mussels, and then sunbathing on a beach or ice floe. Welcome to Svalbard, an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean halfway between Norway and the North Pole. Our homepage stars were photographed in the waters off Spitsbergen, the largest of the archipelago's nine islands, where male and female herds are found year-round. Male walruses can reach almost 12 feet long and weigh more than 2,600 pounds. During mating season, they use this girth to fight among themselves for dominance over groups of females, called harems.
> 
> Whales, dolphins, arctic foxes, reindeer, and polar bears also frequent the archipelago. European whalers first visited Svalbard in 1611, and Norway and Russia still use the islands for coal production. Tourists come for months of summer days, the aurora borealis during polar night, or 'the blue hour' during February—when months of darkness are broken as the sun peeks above the horizon, flooding the landscape with magical blue light.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Covered bridges like West Cornwall Covered Bridge, pictured in today's image, were designed with roofs and siding to protect their wooden structures from weathering, greatly increasing their durability. While many were built in the 19th century, few have survived to the present day, and the ones that have are often preserved for their historical and visual significance.
> 
> The West Cornwall bridge in Cornwall, Connecticut, is a historic wooden lattice truss bridge that spans the Housatonic River. Constructed in 1864 using the central pier from an earlier bridge, it's one of only three remaining roofed bridges in Connecticut. Modified about 50 years ago, it was recognized as a national historic building in 1975 and still supports traffic today. The bridge has appeared in films and postcards, embodying the classic image of a New England village.

> National Public Lands Day takes place every fourth Saturday of September. Today is all about preserving public lands, which can be anything from national parks to urban green spaces. On this day, entry fees to many federal lands are waived, and those who participate in conservation activities like cleanups or restoring historic structures receive free entry coupons for future visits to these locations. This day has grown substantially since it began in 1994. Its first celebration was started by three national agencies and drew 700 volunteers. By 2010, the number of volunteers had increased to 170,000, spreading across more than 2,000 sites.

> Framed by a natural arch in Coyote Gulch, Utah, vibrant golden cottonwood trees stand out against the colorful rock formations of Escalante canyon country. Coyote Gulch is a well-known backpacking destination offering towering vertical canyon walls, narrow slot canyons, domes, arches, and natural bridges to visitors. The upper reaches of the gulch lie within the Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument, while today's image showcases its lower sections in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area (GCNRA). Established in 1972 and managed by the National Park Service, GCNRA is a conservation area that balances recreation and preservation. Unlike national parks that focus primarily on natural preservation, GCNRA offers a variety of facilities, including four public campgrounds, two small airports, and several houseboat rental services, making it a popular destination for visitors.

> The Santa Maria della Salute church in Venice is steeped in history. As a plague devastated the city in 1630, its leader, Doge Nicolò Contarini, vowed to build a majestic church dedicated to the Virgin Mary if the city was spared. In 1631 the epidemic ended, and construction began. The church, built in the Baroque style, was completed around 50 years later, a lifelong project for architect Baldassare Longhena.
> 
> Built at the entrance to the Grand Canal, its dome dominates the Venice skyline. Each November, Venice commemorates the church's significance during the Festa della Madonna della Salute, a cultural celebration that includes festive processions and offering of candles in gratitude for deliverance from the plague.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Tucked away in the highlands of Costa Rica, Los Quetzales National Park offers a kaleidoscope of lush habitats, including one that's home to the blue-throated toucanet. These non-migratory birds use their dexterous toes to navigate branches, while their distinctive bills deftly forage for fruits, insects, and small lizards.
> 
> During breeding season in March to August, toucanets nest in tree cavities lined with leaves and feathers. A close-knit pair of toucanets may share parenting duties, feeding their hatchlings a generous diet of fruit. Blue-throated toucanets are gregarious by nature. Their call—a far-carrying mixture of croaks and chirps that sound like 'rrip rrrip rrip rrip' or 'curré curré curré'—can be heard throughout forests in Costa Rica, western Panama, and northwestern Colombia.

> On this day in 1890, Sequoia National Park was founded in the southern Sierra Nevada to protect one of America's natural splendors. Named after the giant sequoias that dominate the landscape, the park spans more than 629 square miles and is home to wildlife such as black bears, mule deer, and over 200 species of birds, including warblers, vireos, and flycatchers . The giant sequoia trees here have been rooted for more than 2,200 years and are among Earth's oldest living organisms. The park's renowned General Sherman tree rises to an astonishing 275 feet. Named after the American Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, it's not only tall but is also more than 36 feet wide. Visitors flock to capture moments among these ancient giants, whose reddish-brown, fibrous bark and wide-reaching branches evoke a sense of living history.

> In Iceland's Skaftafell, fall isn't just a season—it's an experience. From glaciers to waterfalls, like the one featured here today, to northern lights, this area in Vatnajökull National Park is a showcase of nature's raw beauty. Skaftafell's dramatic landscape was formed over thousands of years by the fierce interplay of volcanic fire and glacial water. Here, the glacier Skaftafellsjökull, a branch of Iceland's largest ice cap Vatnajökull, stretches out like a frozen river, inviting visitors for guided hikes. Then there's Svartifoss, another waterfall in the park, fed by glacial meltwater. Surrounded by dark lava columns resembling a heart from afar, this waterfall inspired the design of Iceland's National Theatre and the Hallgrímskirkja church in Reykjavík.
> 
> Skaftafell's hiking trails range from easy walks to challenging climbs, so there's something for everyone. While the daylight hours may be shorter in this season, there's a bright side—literally. As night falls, the auroras often appear, turning the sky into a swirling mix of green and pink.

One of the oldest known trees in the world, in Portugal, is believed to be 3,350 years old. Many live for millennia, their trunks growing thick and gnarled, and their branches bearing fruit century after century. As civilizations rise and fall around them, these hardy trees remain resilient and steadfast.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
