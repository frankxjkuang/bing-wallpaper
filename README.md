> Today, we travel to the Arashiyama district in Kyoto, renowned for its captivating seasonal landscapes. Here, vibrant Japanese maple trees and serene bamboo forests create a harmonious blend of color and tranquility. These maples, known for their delicate, deeply lobed leaves, turn fiery shades of red, orange, and gold during fall, attracting visitors from around the world. They are celebrated not only for their beauty but also for their cultural symbolism—representing elegance, peace, and the fleeting nature of life.
> 
> The Sagano Bamboo Forest is equally iconic, where towering stalks of madake and mosochiku varieties of bamboo sway gently in the breeze. Bamboo has been integral to Japanese life for centuries, used in everything from architecture and crafts to traditional ceremonies. Its rapid growth and resilience symbolize strength and flexibility, and bamboo groves were historically planted to protect against natural disasters.

> The bison embodies a paradox: immense strength paired with quiet calm. Weighing up to 2,000 pounds and standing 6 feet tall, these giants roam North America's grasslands and river valleys in mobile herds. Photographed here in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, they once numbered in the tens of millions but were nearly eradicated in the 19th century—a loss that reshaped ecosystems and disrupted lifeways.
> 
> Today, on National Bison Day, observed each year in early November, we honor this iconic species' persistence and profound significance. It's only fitting that this celebration falls at the start of Native American Heritage Month: for countless Native Nations, these animals have been revered as teachers, providers, and spiritual relatives, with every part used thoughtfully for sustenance, clothing, tools, and fuel. That's why tribal communities lead efforts to help them reclaim prairie, wetland, and forest habitats, forming social herds led by matriarchs, sparring males, and curious calves.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Tonight, Halloween casts its spell—and only a few places on Earth carry a mystery quite like Bran Castle in Romania. The fortress was built in the 14th century and has withstood wars, monarchs, and shifting empires. But here, legends speak louder than history. Perched between the regions of Transylvania—renowned for its chilling tales—and Wallachia, once ruled by Vlad III Dracula, the castle evokes a haunting legacy. Vlad's ruthless reputation inspired Bram Stoker's 1897 Gothic novel 'Dracula.' Though the story is not set at Bran Castle, its looming form and persistent rumors of Vlad's presence blur fact and legend, forever linking it to one of humanity's most enduring tales.
> 
> Beyond the pages of storybooks, Bran Castle whispers many other haunted narratives. According to local accounts, the sorrowful White Lady drifts through the courtyard; a monk's muffled steps echo from behind the walls that sealed him in; and the playful laughter of unseen children carries through the corridors. Reports of flickering lights, sudden chills, and disembodied voices heighten the unease. On this Halloween, Bran Castle rises beyond the stones that shape it. Here, memory twists into myth, and the line between reality and the supernatural grows thrillingly thin.

> Every fall, the desert town of Pushkar in Rajasthan, India, comes alive with one of the most colorful gatherings—the Pushkar Camel Fair. Timed with the Hindu lunar month of Kartik, it usually takes place between late October and early November on the Gregorian calendar. This year, the celebrations stretch from today until November 5, marking the region's most anticipated season.
> 
> What began as one of the world's largest camel and cattle markets has gradually transformed into a grand celebration of culture and community. Alongside the trading of cattle and camels, visitors now enjoy quirky competitions like 'matka phod' (pot breaking), longest mustache contest, and even bridal shows. Rural families explore vibrant stalls overflowing with textiles, clothes, and glittering bracelets, while the fair itself kicks off with a high-spirited camel race, followed by traditional songs, dances, and lively performances. Among the highlights is the camel showcase, where participants take turns riding the animals in an animated display that adds to the festive charm. In recent years, the fair has introduced new attractions too, including a friendly football match between the local Pushkar Club and teams of foreign tourists.

> The Portuguese island of Madeira—about 600 miles southwest of mainland Portugal—hides a forest unlike any other. On its northern slopes lies Fanal Forest, where veils of mist drift through centuries-old til trees. These are part of the Laurissilva of Madeira—an outstanding relict of a once widespread laurel forest type. Laurissilva is the largest surviving area of its kind, with about 90% considered primary forest. Home to a unique array of plants and animals, including endemic species such as the Madeiran long-toed pigeon, it remains a living museum of natural history.
> 
> In Fanal, the gnarled, moss-draped trunks stand as guardians of this ancient heritage, where nature has preserved its vitality for centuries. Beyond the trails, these woods also offer quiet corners to pause and enjoy. Between scenic viewpoints, a leisure area with a public barbecue, and even a winter lake born from an ancient crater, this is a place to be dazzled, to wander, to play—or simply to breathe and relax.

<summary>Description</summary>

> From 18th-century visitors to fire-carved trails, this rock city tells a story of survival. Hidden in Czechia's Hradec Králové Region, the Adršpach–Teplice Rocks form Central Europe's largest sandstone labyrinth. For centuries, the cliffs and passages lay cloaked in forest, until a great fire stripped the land bare. Arches, towers, and winding corridors emerged out of the ashes, and the first hiking paths were carved into the rock. Soon after, explorers and poets left their marks with stone inscriptions that captured a destination both wild and enchanting.
> 
> Today, the reserve stretches over 5 square miles, preserved within the Broumovsko Protected Landscape Area. Among its treasures stands the Gothic Gate, featured here, which was built in 1839. Commissioned by Ludvik Karel Nádherný along with a network of hiking paths, bridges, and stairways, this striking archway became the symbolic threshold to the City of Rocks. More than a relic of the past, the Gothic Gate still stands as guardian of the labyrinth, welcoming every visitor who steps into the park.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Perched high in the mountains of Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia, the thick-billed raven holds the title of the world's largest raven. At nearly 28 inches in length and weighing more than 3 pounds, it is about a quarter heavier than the common raven. Its enormous, arched bill—pale at the base and close to 3.5 inches long—is the largest among perching birds. These ravens live mostly between 5,000 and 11,200 feet above sea level, found across farmland, rocky cliffs, and even rooftops in mountain towns.
> 
> Thick-billed ravens are versatile feeders, taking carrion, insects, beetle larvae, seeds, and crops like wheat, along with scraps from people. Observers have seen them pulling grubs from dung heaps and even forcing Verreaux's eagle-owls from their nests. Often seen in pairs or small groups, they build large stick nests on cliffs or tall trees, laying three to five bluish-green eggs. Their calls range from deep croaks to wheezy notes, and rare instances of mimicry have been recorded. Their plumage gleams purple in sunlight, a striking figure of the African highlands. Classified as 'least-concern' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the thick-billed raven continues to thrive.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
