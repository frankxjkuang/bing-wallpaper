<summary>Description</summary>

> A red fox standing in the snowfall of Grand Teton National Park is more than a picturesque moment—it offers a glimpse into the resilience of one of North America's most adaptable predators. This small carnivore is instantly recognizable by its sharp gaze and thick, fiery coat that helps it thrive even in Wyoming's harsh winter conditions. Snow muffles sound, yet the animal's extraordinary hearing allows it to detect prey moving beneath the surface. You can almost imagine it pausing amid the drifting flakes, ears rotating, body perfectly still, waiting for the faintest rustle.
> 
> Grand Teton's sweeping valleys and dense forests offer ideal hunting grounds, and winter transforms the landscape into a quiet stage where the fox's movements appear almost theatrical. Its winter fur not only insulates against subzero temperatures but also stands out vividly against the white backdrop, creating the striking contrast often captured in wildlife photography. Seeing a red fox in such conditions highlights the park's rich biodiversity, sharing a reminder that even in the stillness of winter, life in the Tetons remains alert, resourceful, and beautifully wild.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we celebrate the birthday of Ansel Adams, a photographer whose vision helped shape the world's perception of Yosemite National Park. Yosemite is renowned for its granite walls, dramatic waterfalls, and striking light, all of which have inspired generations of artists. One of its most intriguing sights is the Firefall, a term that refers to two distinct events in the park's history. For decades, visitors gathered at Glacier Point to watch an artificial Firefall, in which embers were pushed off the cliff in a glowing stream of fire.
> 
> Far more mysterious is the natural Firefall at Horsetail Fall on El Capitan. On a few evenings in mid- to late February, the sunset hits the waterfall at just the right angle, turning it bright orange, as if molten lava were sliding down the mountain. Clear skies, sufficient water, and perfect timing are all essential for this effect to occur. In 1973, Galen Rowell observed this rare phenomenon and took the first widely known photograph of the natural Firefall—bringing widespread attention to one of Yosemite's most remarkable sights.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Dragon's Eye sounds like something pulled from legend, and standing on Norway's Uttakleiv Beach in the Lofoten Islands, it's easy to see why. The formation, carved into ancient rock and framed by sand and sea, looks uncannily alive, as though the land itself is watching you. Shaped over thousands of years by ice and water, it has become one of the region's most captivating sights.
> 
> Despite its mythic name, the Dragon's Eye is actually a glacial pothole. It is a circular hollow sculpted into metamorphic rocks by turbulent meltwater flowing beneath the vast Fennoscandian Ice Sheet around 20,000 years ago. Under intense pressure, water carrying sand and stones ground into the bedrock, gradually eroding smooth-walled depressions. When the ice retreated roughly 16,000 years ago, these features were revealed, leaving behind formations like the Dragon's Eye, complete with a boulder—or 'pupil'—settled at its center.
> 
> Today, the Eye continues to shift with the elements. Depending on the tide, waves flood the hollow or strip it bare, while algae and light constantly reshape its expression, blurring the line between legend and landscape.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This species missed the domestication memo and kept going on its own terms. Say hello to Przewalski's horse, considered the last truly wild horse on Earth. Once widespread across Central Asia, it disappeared from the wild in the 1960s after decades of hunting, habitat loss, and competition with livestock. Its survival depended on an unlikely lifeline: a small number of individuals captured by early 20th‑century collectors, which became the foundation of all modern Przewalski's horses.
> 
> Thanks to global breeding and reintroduction programs, the species has made a cautious comeback. Today, small but stable groups roam protected areas in Mongolia, China, and Russia. Przewalski's horses graze for long stretches, shifting between grasses, herbs, and shrubs as seasons change. They live in small family groups led by a dominant stallion, while bachelor males often form separate bands. Mares usually give birth to a single foal in the late spring, when fresh vegetation peaks.
> 
> Even with these gains, recovery remains fragile. Climate extremes and limited genetic diversity continue to challenge recovery. As a symbolic nod, 2026 marks the Year of the Horse in the Chinese calendar—shining a spotlight on a species that nearly vanished but endures against the odds.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, marks the beginning of a new year on the traditional Chinese lunisolar calendar. This calendar follows the phases of the moon and the rhythms of the seasons. Red lanterns—like the ones shown in today's image—are widely associated with the celebration. The holiday falls on the new moon between January 21 and February 20 and has been observed for more than 2,000 years. In 2024, UNESCO added the Spring Festival to its Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list, recognizing its cultural and historical importance.
> 
> The festival follows a 15-day sequence, beginning on Chinese New Year's Eve and ending with the Lantern Festival. Each day traditionally carries its own customs, though practices vary from region to region. Even with these regional differences, the overall progression of the celebration remains similar across communities, reflecting a shared cultural framework tied to the lunar calendar.
> 
> The date of Chinese New Year changes annually because it is based on lunar cycles rather than the Gregorian calendar. This shifting date sets it apart from fixed-date holidays and explains why the festival's timing varies each year, even though its internal structure stays consistent.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Presidents' Day is observed on the third Monday of February and is officially recognized at the federal level as Washington's Birthday. The holiday was originally celebrated on February 22, George Washington's birthday, before being rescheduled under the Uniform Monday Holiday Act. Passed in 1968 and implemented in 1971, the Act shifted several federal holidays to Mondays, creating standardized long weekends. Washington's Birthday was among those affected, which moved the observance away from Washington's actual birthday and allowed its meaning to broaden over time.
> 
> Although the federal name remains unchanged, Presidents' Day is commonly observed as a day that extends beyond a single figure. Many states and communities use the occasion to recognize multiple US presidents, most often George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, whose birthdays both fall in February. This broader interpretation has developed through public custom rather than federal mandate, shaping how the holiday is understood today.
> 
> Pictured here, the Lincoln Memorial stands on the National Mall in Washington, DC, honoring the 16th president and his leadership during the Civil War. Presidents' Day invites reflection on how the presidency has influenced the nation's institutions and public life, linking early leadership to the role the office continues to play in the United States today.

<summary>Description</summary>

> World Whale Day, observed on the third Sunday of February, began in the 1980s in Hawaii, where communities celebrated the seasonal return of migrating humpback whales. The day gained wider recognition after the International Whaling Commission's 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling, which marked a major milestone in international whale conservation.
> 
> Humpback whales are easily recognizable by their long pectoral fins and are known for their complex songs associated with breeding behavior. Their predictable migrations bring them close to shore, turning them into both a cultural marker of the season and a focal point for early conservation efforts.
> 
> Today, whale conservation extends far beyond hunting restrictions and includes how we use and manage the oceans more broadly. Fishing activity, major shipping routes, underwater noise, plastic waste, and rising ocean temperatures all influence whale movement and feeding patterns. Pictured here are humpback whales feeding cooperatively in Monterey Bay—a behavior that depends on healthy ecosystems and reliable prey availability. Whales also contribute to ocean systems by circulating nutrients that support plankton growth and marine food webs. World Whale Day highlights the ongoing importance of thoughtful ocean stewardship in maintaining balanced marine ecosystems.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
