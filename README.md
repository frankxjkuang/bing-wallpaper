> For 125 years, bird enthusiasts across North America have turned the holiday season into a festive, feathered affair with the Christmas Bird Count. Founded by ornithologist Frank Chapman as an eco-friendly twist on holiday hunting parties, this annual event replaced shotguns with binoculars. Since then, it has become one of the world's longest-running citizen science projects. Every year from December 14 to January 5, volunteers of all ages and birding skill levels come together to survey designated areas called 'circles.' Each circle has a 15-mile diameter, and participants count every bird they see or hear within it. The result is a colossal snapshot of bird diversity, with data collected from over 2,500 locations each season. It's a serious effort to track changes in bird populations, providing valuable data for scientists working to protect vulnerable species.
> 
> One of the fascinating species you might spot is the northern hawk-owl. This medium-sized owl is found in the boreal forests of North America and Europe. Active only during the day, it has exceptional hearing and can plunge into the snow to capture rodents. With its long, tapered tail and small head resembling a hawk, the northern hawk-owl is a striking sight. These owls don't migrate, so they can be spotted year-round. However, winter is the best time to catch a glimpse as they may move south from Canada into the northern United States to find food when it's scarce in their regular territory.

> As the holiday season kicks off, St. Stephen's Basilica becomes the dazzling centerpiece of one of Budapest's iconic Christmas markets. The fair buzzes with holiday spirit, offering a mix of Hungarian craft, festive décor, and local delicacies, capturing the essence of a traditional Christmas. The Advent Feast—an event held in the weeks leading up to Christmas and part of Hungary's holiday traditions—invites guests to savor dishes like chimney cakes, stuffed cabbage, and goulash soup, while the scent of mulled wine and roasted chestnuts fills the air. A highlight for many is the 3D light show projected onto the basilica's facade, a modern touch that brings this historic structure to life.
> 
> This neoclassical basilica honors Stephen I, also known as King Saint Stephen, who was Hungary's first monarch. Completed in 1906 after decades of construction, it is topped by a towering dome. Visitors can explore its chapels, admire the intricate stained glass, or view a relic that is believed to be the mummified right hand of the king himself. For those seeking a panoramic view, the dome has an observation deck where visitors can enjoy sweeping views of the city's skyline, as shown in today's image.

> Here's the red poinsettia, one of the plants synonymous with the holiday season in the United States. With its striking star-shaped leaves, the poinsettia has become a symbol of Christmas cheer, brightening homes and public spaces during winter. Today, National Poinsettia Day celebrates the legacy of Joel Roberts Poinsett, the first US ambassador to Mexico, who introduced these vibrant plants to America in the 1820s. He discovered them while exploring the Taxco region in Guerrero. So taken by their beauty, he sent clippings back to his home in Charleston, South Carolina.
> 
> The history of the poinsettia can be traced back to ancient civilizations. The Aztecs, who called it cuetlaxóchitl, used it to make a reddish-purple dye and treat fevers. But the plant's association with Christmas has roots in Mexican tradition, where it's known as 'la flor de Nochebuena' or 'Holy Night flower.' According to legend, a young girl, unable to afford a gift for Baby Jesus, was inspired to offer humble weeds, which miraculously transformed into the vibrant poinsettias we know today.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today, we celebrate International Mountain Day, an event to honor the towering giants of our planet. Among them are the Tre Cime di Lavaredo, or the 'Three Peaks of Lavaredo,' seen on the right in today's image. A part of the Sexten Dolomites in northeastern Italy, they're one of the most famous mountain groups in the Alps. These three peaks—Cima Grande, Cima Ovest, and Cima Piccola—are a UNESCO World Heritage Site that captivates adventurers and nature lovers alike. During World War I, the front line between Italy and Austria-Hungary cut through the peaks, leaving the area with many remnants of the conflict, such as fortifications, trenches, tunnels, and commemorative plaques.
> 
> International Mountain Day promotes sustainable mountain development and the preservation of these landscapes. Mountains are not only home to thousands of species of land animals and plants, but also to 15% of the world's human population. Because of climate change and overexploitation, the fragile ecosystems that mountains support—and the time we have to protect them—are slipping away faster than we think. Sometimes, even the mightiest peaks can't hold out forever.

> Windswept cliffs, rugged beauty, and dramatic ocean views—welcome to Land's End in Cornwall, England. Since ancient Greek times, when it was known as 'Belerion' or 'Place of the Sun,' or in Arthurian legends about the lost land of Lyonesse, Land's End has always been a place of fascination. Land's End is the most southwestern point on mainland Britain. It's often the starting point or end of charity races that run the length of the island of Great Britain from Land's End to John o'Groats at Britain's northeastern tip.
> 
> The first thing you'll notice about Land's End is the cliffs towering above the crashing waves. The sea carved these granite walls over millennia, creating one of the most striking coastlines in the United Kingdom. These cliffs are part of the South West Coast Path, a 630-mile trail popular among hikers that runs from Minehead in Somerset to Poole in Dorset. The Cornish Coastal Path, featured in today's image, is a section of this trail, and snow here is a rare occurrence because of Cornwall's mild coastal climate and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. So, whether you're here to hike, relax, or just stand at the frozen edge, Land's End is a memorable cliffhanger.

> Prick up your ears and crane your neck—it's National Llama Day. Part of a family that includes camels, alpacas, and guanacos, llamas have long been domesticated in South America because of their hardiness and ability to thrive on the bleak vegetation in the mountains and plateaus of the Andes. At up to 6 feet tall and weighing up to 400 pounds, they were used primarily as pack animals for about 6,500 years. They were also bred as a source of food, hides, tallow for candles, dung for fuel, and fabric. While inferior to alpaca and guanaco wool, llama fleece is soft, warm, durable, and fairly lightweight. It's used for clothing, rugs, and rope.
> 
> Unlike their wild guanaco cousins, seen in today's image in Torres del Paine National Park, Chile, llamas have been popular on farms across the US since the 1980s. Llamas are surprisingly clean, smart, and loyal companions that can even be trained as therapy animals. Their gentle nature has made them popular at petting zoos and farms, and unlike their camel cousins, they rarely spit at humans. They're also good guard animals that will charge at predators and scream at intruders. With a population of almost 30,000 in the country, Americans have clearly fallen in love with llamas.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In the heart of Paris stands one of the city's most enduring icons: Notre-Dame Cathedral. Built between the 12th and 13th centuries on the Île de la Cité—an island in the Seine—Notre-Dame has witnessed centuries of French history, from the Hundred Years' War to the French Revolution, and beyond. Although it was chosen by Napoleon as the site of his coronation as emperor in 1804, by the early 19th century, the cathedral was in a state of disrepair. However, one novel changed its fortunes: 'The Hunchback of Notre-Dame' by Victor Hugo, published in 1831. The popularity of this book helped encourage a restoration project that renewed the cathedral's former beauty.
> 
> In April 2019, tragedy struck—a fire broke out in the roof space of Notre-Dame. By the time the blaze was extinguished, the cathedral's wooden spire had been destroyed, along with most of the roof, and there was extensive damage to the tops of the building's walls. Reconstruction efforts have been underway over the last five years , and today, Notre-Dame will reopen to the public. Finally, visitors will once again be able to marvel at the medieval majesty of this beautiful cathedral.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
