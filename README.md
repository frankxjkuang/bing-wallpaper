<summary>Description</summary>

> In 1987, sometime around July 11, the world population reached the 5-billion mark. The United Nations recognized the need to address issues like family planning, infrastructure, waste, and pollution and established World Population Day in 1989. It is estimated that we hit 8 billion people in November 2022 and the UN expects the world to reach 9.7 billion people in 2050. But not everywhere faces the same challenges. While some areas struggle with overcrowding, others grapple with decreasing populations. The Italian town of Gangi, Sicily, seen in today's image, had about 16,000 residents in the 1950s. Today, it is home to little more than 6,000. Keen on revitalization, Gangi attracts new residents by giving away abandoned houses, on the condition that the properties are then restored.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Black and yellow plumage, bright eyes, and an oversized billâ€”meet the collared aracari, a fascinating tropical bird. Gracing the forests from Mexico through Costa Rica, where today's image was taken, to Colombia and Venezuela, this toucan gets its name from the red marking on the back of the neck. These birds circle through the air in groups of up to 15, and at night, snuggle together in tree cavities. Their song is as unique as their lookâ€”a high squeaky note that sounds like 'seek,' sometimes a 'purr' or even a raspy 'grhhrr.' Although deforestation and hunting pose threats to these birds, they are not endangered. For now, collared aracaris remain a captivating sight, a splash of color, and a burst of life amid the sprawling branches.

> As Argentina celebrates Independence Day, Talampaya National Park invites us to venture into the country's ancient heart. Here, towering red rock formations reach skyward, and cliffs and caves feature petroglyphs created by the CiÃ©naga, Diaguita, and other Indigenous cultures more than 1,000 years ago. This 830-square-mile park in La Rioja province is also home to some of the oldest dinosaur remains ever found. Moreover, nature's beauty is shown in the local flora, like xeric shrubs and cactus, and fauna. Guanacos, hares, and foxes roam free, while condors, white-throated cacholotes, and sandy gallitos grace the skies above this UNESCO World Heritage Site.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Celebrate National Blueberry Day by indulging in the sweet, tangy flavors of this beloved fruit. Wild blueberries are native to North America and have been around for over 13,000 years. However, they weren't commercially farmed until the early 20th century, when the first domesticated variety was bred in New Jersey by Elizabeth Coleman White, an agricultural specialist, and botanist Frederick Coville.
> 
> The United States is a leading blueberry producer, with bountiful harvests from states including Maine, Michigan, and Oregon. Blueberries are North America's second-most popular berry, after strawberries. They're not just deliciousâ€”they are also fiber-rich and packed with antioxidants and vitamin C. So, toss them in your smoothies, sprinkle them over oatmeal, or savor them fresh and flaunt your blue-stained smile.

> Welcome to walled town of Conwy, on the north coast of Wales, UK, and its spectacular medieval castle. Conwy Castle was built between 1283 and 1287 on the orders of English King Edward I, during his conquest of Wales. Designed by James of St. George, one of the greatest architects of the time, the castle is a UNESCO World Heritage Site which draws visitors from across the world.
> 
> The castle towers over the River Conwy, which this weekend hosts the annual Conwy River Festival, including boat races and other water-based events. Spectators gather to witness the nautical parade and enjoy local delicacies like bara brith, a tea bread flavored with tea, dried fruits, and spices, and laverbread made from edible seaweed. The name Conwy is from the Welsh words 'cyn' (chief) and 'gwy' (water) and the town sits at the mouth of the river. It is also the gateway to Eryri National Park, home to Wales's highest mountain Yr Wyddfa, or Snowdon in English.

> Welcome to a land where greenery meets the endless blue. On the North Queensland coast of Australia, encircled by dense foliage, is Noah Beach. A fascinating blend of two ecosystems, here the Daintree Rainforest seamlessly meets the azure waters of the Coral Sea. This secluded area of the Daintree National Park boasts a stretch of soft, golden sands while elsewhere there are towering trees, lush ferns, and other plant species unique to the area. The Daintree is believed to have been around for up to 180 million years, making it the oldest tropical rainforest in the world.
