> On World Migratory Bird Day, we introduce the indigo bunting, a tiny bird with plumage like the twilight sky. They traverse thousands of miles using the stars to navigate as they fly between North America, and their wintering grounds in Central America and northern South America.
> 
> Inaugurated in 2006, World Migratory Bird Day brings people together to help protect our feathered friends and engage in birdwatching, educational programs, and conservation efforts. This year's campaign highlights reducing the use of pesticides and fertilizers and switching to organic farming. So, let's turn our gazes upward and pledge to safeguard the flyways that are essential for ecological balance.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This pristine aquatic sanctuary so pristine that it feels like a secret whispered by the ocean itself. Misool is an island of almost 800 square miles within the Raja Ampat archipelago in Indonesia. The archipelago comprises four main islands, including Misool, Waigeo, Batanta, and Salawati. Here, the waves caress the powder-white sands, while a kaleidoscope of marine life swims beneath the surface. Raja Ampat is part of the Coral Triangle, a remote ocean wilderness that is home to hundreds of species of reef-building corals alongside marine turtles, sharks, whales, dugongs, dolphins, and thousands of species of reef fish. The archipelago is dotted with Marine Protected Areas, of which Misool is the largest, and includes nesting beaches for green and hawksbill turtles. Surrounded by a 'no-take zone' with fishing and hunting activities banned and a shark and manta ray sanctuary, Misool offers hope for the future of our oceans.

> Make way as this tiny duckling waddles into the spotlight, ready to charm us with its playful antics! Ducks, with their vibrant plumage and cheerful quacks, epitomize the rural idyll, but they are also found in urban environments. When ducklings arrive in spring, they steal the show. Tiny and fluffy, they follow their mothers dutifully, learning the ways of water with each paddle and peck. And by feeding on insects and algae, they are also helping to keep aquatic ecosystems in balance.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In today's image, the sun encroaches on the Roaches, a rocky ridge in the Peak District, northern England. Its strange name comes from the French 'les roches,' which means 'the rocks.' Rising to a height of over 1,600 feet, the ridge is a popular destination for climbers and hikers in the Peak District National Park. It offers stunning views over the moorland and, if you're lucky, you may spot a wallaby! A number of these Australian marsupials escaped from a nearby private zoo in the 1930s, and there are still recorded sightings of the descendants of the original wallabies.
> 
> The Roaches is a protected habitat for other animals too; its blanket bogs and upland moorlands are home to a range of birds, including curlews, red grouse, tree pipits, and peregrine falcons. A very different sort of creature is said to live at the top of the ridge. Local legend has it that Doxey Pool—a small pond—is home to a malevolent mermaid who tempts people into the water.

> Today's homepage takes us to the Mexican city of San Miguel de Allende, to toast Cinco de Mayo, or 'Fifth of May.' Not to be confused with Mexico's Independence Day, Cinco de Mayo instead marks Mexico’s 1862 triumph over France at the Battle of Puebla. The holiday is observed in Mexico but has become popular in the US since the 1980s thanks to various advertising campaigns. Here it has evolved into a wider celebration of Mexican culture, whether it is food, history, art, or the colorful architecture of cities like San Miguel de Allende, established in the 16th century, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
