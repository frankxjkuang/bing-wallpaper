<summary>Description</summary>

> Let's explore the Taj Mahal, on the banks of the Yamuna River in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. This ivory-white marble mausoleum was commissioned in 1631 by Shah Jahan, the fifth Mughal emperor, to honor his late wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.
> 
> This tomb is the centerpiece of a sprawling 42-acre complex, which also includes a mosque, a guest house, and beautifully landscaped gardens surrounded by a grand wall. The tomb is flanked by giant arches and alcoves that merge Indo-Islamic and Mughal architectural styles. It's also an incredible architectural feat, with the outer dome reaching around 145 feet high and the inner one standing more 75 feet. Celebrated as a jewel of Muslim art and a global masterpiece, the Taj Mahal was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.

> Ever wonder how some of our rivers stay unspoiled? It's thanks to the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, which was signed into law on this day in 1968. This legislation created the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System which preserves rivers with exceptional natural, cultural, and recreational qualities.
> 
> The national rivers system oversees more than 13,000 miles of 228 rivers across 41 states, and Puerto Rico, a tiny fraction of the 3.5 million miles of US rivers. It categorizes rivers as wild, scenic, or recreational. The Wind River in northeastern Alaska, seen in today's image, is a wild river, isolated and undeveloped. This 85-mile river flows from the Philip Smith Mountains to the East Fork of the Chandalar River, winding through a valley filled with lakes and wetlands. Part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, this river valley is a bustling habitat for Dall sheep, moose, caribou, and grizzly bears. In a changing world, it's comforting to know these rivers will remain unchanged.

<summary>Description</summary>

> There's a reason why famed American photographer Ansel Adams fell in love with Yosemite National Park: vistas like today's image of Half Dome. The park, in central California's Sierra Nevada range, has been a popular destination for artists, mountaineers, settlers, and nature lovers since the mid-1800s. To protect it from logging and overgrazing by cattle, Congress designated Yosemite a national park on this day in 1890. It's one of the most visited parks in the US, with more than 3 million visitors a year.
> 
> At almost 9,000 feet tall, Half Dome is only one of Yosemite's geological wonders. Other famous climbing destinations include El Capitan and Mount Lyell, which at 13,114 feet tall is the park's highest summit. Yosemite is also famous for its waterfalls and is home to giant sequoia trees, black bears, mountain lions, and endangered Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep.

<summary>Description</summary>

> What's the perfect thing to do under the midnight sun? If you're a walrus, the answer might be taking a quick dip with your crew, chowing down on clams and mussels, and then sunbathing on a beach or ice floe. Welcome to Svalbard, an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean halfway between Norway and the North Pole. Our homepage stars were photographed in the waters off Spitsbergen, the largest of the archipelago's nine islands, where male and female herds are found year-round. Male walruses can reach almost 12 feet long and weigh more than 2,600 pounds. During mating season, they use this girth to fight among themselves for dominance over groups of females, called harems.
> 
> Whales, dolphins, arctic foxes, reindeer, and polar bears also frequent the archipelago. European whalers first visited Svalbard in 1611, and Norway and Russia still use the islands for coal production. Tourists come for months of summer days, the aurora borealis during polar night, or 'the blue hour' during February—when months of darkness are broken as the sun peeks above the horizon, flooding the landscape with magical blue light.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Covered bridges like West Cornwall Covered Bridge, pictured in today's image, were designed with roofs and siding to protect their wooden structures from weathering, greatly increasing their durability. While many were built in the 19th century, few have survived to the present day, and the ones that have are often preserved for their historical and visual significance.
> 
> The West Cornwall bridge in Cornwall, Connecticut, is a historic wooden lattice truss bridge that spans the Housatonic River. Constructed in 1864 using the central pier from an earlier bridge, it's one of only three remaining roofed bridges in Connecticut. Modified about 50 years ago, it was recognized as a national historic building in 1975 and still supports traffic today. The bridge has appeared in films and postcards, embodying the classic image of a New England village.

> National Public Lands Day takes place every fourth Saturday of September. Today is all about preserving public lands, which can be anything from national parks to urban green spaces. On this day, entry fees to many federal lands are waived, and those who participate in conservation activities like cleanups or restoring historic structures receive free entry coupons for future visits to these locations. This day has grown substantially since it began in 1994. Its first celebration was started by three national agencies and drew 700 volunteers. By 2010, the number of volunteers had increased to 170,000, spreading across more than 2,000 sites.

> Framed by a natural arch in Coyote Gulch, Utah, vibrant golden cottonwood trees stand out against the colorful rock formations of Escalante canyon country. Coyote Gulch is a well-known backpacking destination offering towering vertical canyon walls, narrow slot canyons, domes, arches, and natural bridges to visitors. The upper reaches of the gulch lie within the Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument, while today's image showcases its lower sections in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area (GCNRA). Established in 1972 and managed by the National Park Service, GCNRA is a conservation area that balances recreation and preservation. Unlike national parks that focus primarily on natural preservation, GCNRA offers a variety of facilities, including four public campgrounds, two small airports, and several houseboat rental services, making it a popular destination for visitors.

> The Santa Maria della Salute church in Venice is steeped in history. As a plague devastated the city in 1630, its leader, Doge Nicolò Contarini, vowed to build a majestic church dedicated to the Virgin Mary if the city was spared. In 1631 the epidemic ended, and construction began. The church, built in the Baroque style, was completed around 50 years later, a lifelong project for architect Baldassare Longhena.
> 
> Built at the entrance to the Grand Canal, its dome dominates the Venice skyline. Each November, Venice commemorates the church's significance during the Festa della Madonna della Salute, a cultural celebration that includes festive processions and offering of candles in gratitude for deliverance from the plague.

One of the oldest known trees in the world, in Portugal, is believed to be 3,350 years old. Many live for millennia, their trunks growing thick and gnarled, and their branches bearing fruit century after century. As civilizations rise and fall around them, these hardy trees remain resilient and steadfast.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
