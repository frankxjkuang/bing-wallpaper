> Welcome to the slice of paradise that is Telašćica Nature Park, on the Croatian island of Dugi Otok. Pictured behind cliffs separating it from the Adriatic Sea is the park's Telašćica Bay, which stretches inland over 6 miles and is the largest natural harbor in the Adriatic. Dotted with islets and surrounded by small islands, its dramatic cliffs tower more than 520 feet above sea level and are known locally as the 'stene.' Other features of the park include 25 secluded beaches, as well as the therapeutic Mir salt lake known for its healing properties. So, the next time you're in the mood for island-hopping, come to Telašćica, where the land and sea play an endless game of tag.

> Get ready to celebrate elephants, the largest living land animals. There are three elephant species alive today: African bush, African forest, and Asian. All three species are endangered, and World Elephant Day is dedicated to highlighting the challenges they face, like the ivory trade and habitat loss.
> 
> Today's image features a herd of African elephants roaming the vast expanses of Amboseli National Park in Kenya. Elephants live in groups made up of several families led by a matriarch, an older female elephant, while males leave to live alone or in bachelor herds.
> 
> Thanks to conservation work and the support of the Maasai people, Amboseli is one of the best places in Africa to view large herds, against the dramatic backdrop of Mount Kilimanjaro.

> Discover the beauty of Vancouver Island, Canada. The wooden pathway in today's image, surrounded by ancient pine and cedar trees, leads to Kennedy Lake, the largest freshwater body on the island. The lake covers a surface area of 16,000 acres. It is part of the ancestral lands of the Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation where the Clayoquot and Kennedy Rivers meet. Tofino, over 24 miles away, has a real surf vibe. This small coastal town is a sanctuary for hikers, bird watchers, artists, and dreamers. Famous for its mild winters and pleasant summers, it has been a filming location for movies like 'The Twilight Saga: New Moon' and 'One Week.'

<summary>Description</summary>

> California's Joshua Tree National Park has a history that began way before it was made a national monument on August 10, 1936. Located where the Mojave and Colorado Deserts meet, it has been home to various cultures for thousands of years. Its earliest known residents were people from the Pinto Culture, who lived here from 8000 to 4000 BCE. Centuries later, this land was inhabited by the native Cahuilla, Serrano, and Chemehuevi peoples. The park's namesake, the Joshua tree, grows in a landscape covering 1,242 square miles. Despite their name, they are not really trees, but rather a kind of succulent. Native to southwest US and northern Mexico, they can grow up to 40 feet tall.
> 
> Today, Joshua Tree National Park invites adventurers to explore its terrain. Whether it's hiking through Hidden Valley, visiting the Cholla Cactus Garden, or marveling at Skull Rock, this national park has a lot to offer. By night, it becomes a stargazer's paradise, as seen in today's image. Whether you seek adventure or a moment of tranquility, Joshua Tree awaits with open skies.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we are celebrating the heritage and culture of native populations worldwide. There are some 5,000 Indigenous cultures in 90 countries around the world, from Samoa and Greenland to New Zealand and Nepal. One of the major challenges they face is the loss of their languages: It's estimated that of the 4,000 Indigenous languages in the world, around 2,600 are in danger of becoming extinct.
> 
> In the city of Cusco, Peru, the stone walls of Sacsayhuamán, seen in today's image, murmur tales of the mighty Inca civilization. The Quechua word Sacsayhuamán means 'the place where the hawk is satisfied.' The citadel's walls, which extended over 1,000 feet, were built in the 15th century CE. The boulders used to make them were carved and placed without mortar. After the Inca Empire was defeated at a battle here in 1536, Sacsayhuamán was dismantled by the Spanish and the rest of the structure was covered in earth. It was rediscovered in 1934 when the site was excavated. On this day, let's learn the importance of preserving Indigenous cultures and wisdom, as we honor the Indigenous peoples.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Could you win a staring contest with this spotted owlet? These primarily nocturnal owls are sometimes mobbed during the day by birds trying to defend their territory from predators. With their piercing yellow eyes, the small owls will stare down intruders, bob their heads, and emit a loud 'chirurrr-chirurrr-chirurrr' screech, sometimes likened to laughter or chuckling.
> 
> Standing around 8 inches tall, speckle-plumed spotted owlets can be found from Iran to Vietnam. This one was photographed in Bangkok, Thailand. They eat insects and small mammals like bats and mice, which they often store to eat later when food is scarce. Spotted owlets flourish in various environments, from semi-deserts, rocky areas, and forests to farmlands and urban areas. While they aren't endangered, the spotted owlet's population is thought to have declined, perhaps owing to loss of habitat and increased urbanization.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Amid dusky hues, lighthouses mark where a Great Lake meets a river. Two piers were built on Lake Michigan, one either side of the mouth of the St. Joseph River to help protect ships sailing upstream. In the early 20th century, a lighthouse was built at the end of each pier; the St. Joseph North Pier Inner and Outer Lights, pictured here.
> 
> Congress designated August 7 as National Lighthouse Day in 1989 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Lighthouse Act and to celebrate these iconic structures. Lighthouses not only mark hazards, and safe entries to harbors; these striking buildings also add a touch of romance to coastal scenes and shine a light onto our maritime history.
