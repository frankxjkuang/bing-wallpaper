> These dragon tail-like structures that stretch into the Bay of Biscay are part of one of the most unique and remarkable geologic formations on the planet. The Basque Coast of northern Spain is a wonderland for geologists and for people who just like looking at cool rocks. Guided tours of the Basque Coast Geopark allow visitors to discover 60 million years of uninterrupted geologic history.

> Class trip? Looks like this teacher has their youngsters in line. If only it were always this easy.... Today is World Teachers' Day, and we're celebrating educators of all kinds. This year's theme is 'Teachers at the heart of educational renewal,' and it highlights the remarkable efforts of teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine. They've had to balance health and safety concerns with an abrupt switch to remote learning or partial in-person classes, all while focusing on the education and well-being of their students.
> 
> Our flamingo teacher here may not have had to worry about COVID, but they certainly have their wings full. Though their gray charges don't look flamingo-y yet, they will. Flamingo youngsters, like those here at the Ría Lagartos Biosphere Reserve in Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula, develop the coloration of adults at around 1 to 2 years of age, so those trademark pink feathers will soon start to appear. The hot-pink coloring comes from the flamingo diet: They eat food that contains a lot of alpha and beta carotenoid pigments, such as algae, bugs, crustaceans, and mollusks.

> Since the first pictures arrived from the James Webb Space Telescope this July, the world has been mesmerized by the vividness, resolution, and literally otherworldly nature of the telescope's infrared images. The JWST's technology will revolutionize the fields of astronomy and cosmology, allowing observation of the first stars in the universe and the formation of the first galaxies. The telescope's high infrared resolution and sensitivity may even allow it to reveal potentially habitable exoplanets.
> 
> Today marks the first day of World Space Week, a UN-recognized event that runs each year from October 4, the anniversary of the launch of Sputnik in 1957, to October 10, the anniversary of the Outer Space Treaty going into effect in 1967. We're celebrating with this iridescent image of an early star-forming region called the Cosmic Cliffs in the Carina Nebula, captured in infrared.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> In Belgium's largest city, the Antwerp Port Authority is housed in a century-old building that sports a gleaming new addition. The update to the building, known as the Port House, was the vision that Zaha Hadid created with her team at Zaha Hadid Architects, which won a 2009 competition to build the new structure around a 1911 firehouse. Work was completed in 2016, the same year the famed architect died. The expansion is intended to resemble the hull of a sailing ship with a protruding bow glimmering with diamonds, recalling Antwerp's longtime trade in precious stones.
> 
> Today we celebrate World Architecture Day and its 2022 theme of 'Architecture for well-being.' Architecture that preserves historic buildings by combining them with modern structures is becoming more prevalent as cities seek to retain the spirit of their earlier incarnations while creating new, modern spaces and never-before-seen constructions. Some famous examples of this style include the Brooklyn Museum in New York City, the Museum of Military History in Dresden, Germany, and another Hadid design, St. Antony's College in Oxford, England.

<summary>Description</summary>

> October means pumpkin fields, Halloween, leaf-peeping, and the World Series. But in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the beginning of October means a skyful of hot air balloons. The 50th Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta is the largest gathering of balloonists in the world, with more than 500 hot air balloons going aloft this week. The now nine-day event got its start by launching 13 balloons from a shopping mall parking lot in 1972 to celebrate the birthday of a local radio station. It has easily become the biggest event of the year in Albuquerque, whose entire populace can view balloons in flight simply by stepping outside their homes and looking up.
> 
> The event is staged from the 365-acre Balloon Fiesta Park, on the northern outskirts of Albuquerque with the Sandia Mountains a few miles away. The Balloon Fiesta claims to be the most photographed event in the world, and it's easy to understand why. The highlight of the week is a mass ascension, in two waves, of all the balloons, decorated with every color and some shaped like animals or cartoon characters. In the age of jets and helicopters and rockets, this mass celebration of nearly silent flight reminds us that the magic of flying is not about speed, but simply reaching the sky.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> There are thousands of waterfalls in Yosemite National Park, but perhaps none are as well known as Bridalveil Fall. First things first: Don't call it 'falls' because then someone may think you were in Utah where another waterfall bears the surprisingly similar name, Bridal Veil Falls. Bridalveil, as seen in the photo, is often the first waterfall visitors to Yosemite encounter. It plunges 617 feet and flows year-round, fed with water from Ostrander Lake nearly 10 miles away. When the flow is light, brisk winds blow the water sideways. That's why the Ahwahneechee Native Americans, who have lived in the Yosemite Valley for centuries, traditionally called the waterfall Pohono, or 'Spirit of the Puffing Wind.'
> 
> When Yosemite was made a national park on this date in 1890, it not only preserved this jewel of the Sierra Nevada from being turned over to sheep grazing, it was also pivotal to the continued idea of protecting natural areas for the future. Scottish American environmentalist John Muir is credited with convincing President Benjamin Harrison to preserve the Yosemite Valley, and that success kicked off a string of conservation efforts that would eventually lead to the creation of the National Park System. Today, Yosemite's pristine wilderness is internationally known for mountains, granite cliffs, giant sequoia groves, and, of course, waterfalls.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> The end of September in the Southern Hemisphere means warming weather and the nearing of summer. For southern right whales like this one off the coast of Argentina, it's time to migrate southward toward Antarctica and rich feeding grounds. Southern right whales are a subspecies of right whale that inhabit the oceans below the equator. They feed on krill at the surface of the water, holding their mouths open as they swim through clouds of the tiny crustaceans.
> 
> Right whales got their name because they were the 'right' whale to hunt, desirable to whalers because they were relatively slow and floated when they died. Right whales are easily identifiable by the thick white calluses on their heads. They tend to be social and curious creatures and sometimes have close encounters with humans. They spend the southern winter in warmer waters closer to the equator. The whale featured today surfaced off the Valdes Peninsula, home to the largest breeding population in the world, and a fitting location for the Southern Whale Natural Monument, created in 1984. In these protected waters, thousands of whales will mate and give birth, staying until October or November, when they will begin their great migration south.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
