<summary>Description</summary>

> This species missed the domestication memo and kept going on its own terms. Say hello to Przewalski's horse, considered the last truly wild horse on Earth. Once widespread across Central Asia, it disappeared from the wild in the 1960s after decades of hunting, habitat loss, and competition with livestock. Its survival depended on an unlikely lifeline: a small number of individuals captured by early 20th‑century collectors, which became the foundation of all modern Przewalski's horses.
> 
> Thanks to global breeding and reintroduction programs, the species has made a cautious comeback. Today, small but stable groups roam protected areas in Mongolia, China, and Russia. Przewalski's horses graze for long stretches, shifting between grasses, herbs, and shrubs as seasons change. They live in small family groups led by a dominant stallion, while bachelor males often form separate bands. Mares usually give birth to a single foal in the late spring, when fresh vegetation peaks.
> 
> Even with these gains, recovery remains fragile. Climate extremes and limited genetic diversity continue to challenge recovery. As a symbolic nod, 2026 marks the Year of the Horse in the Chinese calendar—shining a spotlight on a species that nearly vanished but endures against the odds.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, marks the beginning of a new year on the traditional Chinese lunisolar calendar. This calendar follows the phases of the moon and the rhythms of the seasons. Red lanterns—like the ones shown in today's image—are widely associated with the celebration. The holiday falls on the new moon between January 21 and February 20 and has been observed for more than 2,000 years. In 2024, UNESCO added the Spring Festival to its Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list, recognizing its cultural and historical importance.
> 
> The festival follows a 15-day sequence, beginning on Chinese New Year's Eve and ending with the Lantern Festival. Each day traditionally carries its own customs, though practices vary from region to region. Even with these regional differences, the overall progression of the celebration remains similar across communities, reflecting a shared cultural framework tied to the lunar calendar.
> 
> The date of Chinese New Year changes annually because it is based on lunar cycles rather than the Gregorian calendar. This shifting date sets it apart from fixed-date holidays and explains why the festival's timing varies each year, even though its internal structure stays consistent.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Presidents' Day is observed on the third Monday of February and is officially recognized at the federal level as Washington's Birthday. The holiday was originally celebrated on February 22, George Washington's birthday, before being rescheduled under the Uniform Monday Holiday Act. Passed in 1968 and implemented in 1971, the Act shifted several federal holidays to Mondays, creating standardized long weekends. Washington's Birthday was among those affected, which moved the observance away from Washington's actual birthday and allowed its meaning to broaden over time.
> 
> Although the federal name remains unchanged, Presidents' Day is commonly observed as a day that extends beyond a single figure. Many states and communities use the occasion to recognize multiple US presidents, most often George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, whose birthdays both fall in February. This broader interpretation has developed through public custom rather than federal mandate, shaping how the holiday is understood today.
> 
> Pictured here, the Lincoln Memorial stands on the National Mall in Washington, DC, honoring the 16th president and his leadership during the Civil War. Presidents' Day invites reflection on how the presidency has influenced the nation's institutions and public life, linking early leadership to the role the office continues to play in the United States today.

<summary>Description</summary>

> World Whale Day, observed on the third Sunday of February, began in the 1980s in Hawaii, where communities celebrated the seasonal return of migrating humpback whales. The day gained wider recognition after the International Whaling Commission's 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling, which marked a major milestone in international whale conservation.
> 
> Humpback whales are easily recognizable by their long pectoral fins and are known for their complex songs associated with breeding behavior. Their predictable migrations bring them close to shore, turning them into both a cultural marker of the season and a focal point for early conservation efforts.
> 
> Today, whale conservation extends far beyond hunting restrictions and includes how we use and manage the oceans more broadly. Fishing activity, major shipping routes, underwater noise, plastic waste, and rising ocean temperatures all influence whale movement and feeding patterns. Pictured here are humpback whales feeding cooperatively in Monterey Bay—a behavior that depends on healthy ecosystems and reliable prey availability. Whales also contribute to ocean systems by circulating nutrients that support plankton growth and marine food webs. World Whale Day highlights the ongoing importance of thoughtful ocean stewardship in maintaining balanced marine ecosystems.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Valentine's Day celebrates the heart in all its forms—love that is bold or tender, hopeful or quietly vulnerable. Few symbols capture this emotion as naturally as the bleeding heart flower, pictured here. With its unmistakable heart-shaped blooms, the plant emerges each spring, growing up to 2 feet tall and spreading nearly 30 inches wide, creating a graceful, almost poetic display.
> 
> That beauty, however, is fleeting. As warmer weather arrives, the bleeding heart completes its cycle: the flowers fade, the foliage retreats, and by late spring or early summer, the plant slips gently into dormancy. Its short-lived bloom is part of its charm.
> 
> Unlike flowers that demand attention, bleeding hearts offer a quieter kind of romance. Their brief bloom reminds us that connections feel meaningful because they evolve over time. Valentine's Day reflects that idea as well. Whether you're celebrating a new relationship, honoring a long partnership, or simply acknowledging the people who matter most, the day is about recognition as much as romance. Seen through that lens, the bleeding heart fits the moment—simple, sincere, and meaningful without needing to last forever.

> Before bridges, rivers set the pace of travel. Now, with bridges, people do. That shift explains why cross-border links like the Third Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge connecting Laos and Thailand matter. Bridges come in many forms, each built to meet a specific challenge. Arch bridges manage compression, suspension bridges span long distances, and concrete box-girder bridges prioritize stability and load efficiency. This bridge uses the box-girder design, making it a practical choice for crossing the wide, fast-moving Mekong River.
> 
> Opened in 2011, the Third Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge was developed to strengthen transport links between Nakhon Phanom Province in Thailand and Thakhek, in Khammouane Province, Laos. Thailand funded much of the project, continuing a pattern set by earlier crossings such as the First Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge between Nong Khai and Vientiane and the Second Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge linking Mukdahan and Savannakhet.
> 
> Measuring about 4,669 feet, the bridge comprises two traffic lanes, serving local commuters and long-haul freight alike. This has helped ease congestion at other crossings and made cross-border movement more reliable. Beyond transport efficiency, the bridge supports logistics, tourism, and cross-border cooperation, showing how infrastructure can quietly reshape regional connections without demanding attention.

> Darwin Day marks more than a birthday—it marks a shift in thinking. Charles Darwin's observations connected variation, the survival of individuals best suited to their environment, and inheritance in ways science still builds on. His legacy rests on years of studying variation—finches, fossils, barnacles—and recognizing patterns others had overlooked. When 'On the Origin of Species' was published in 1859, it offered a framework explaining how species evolve through natural selection.
> 
> One of the most recognizable animals tied to Darwin's work is the blue-footed booby, seen in today's image. Widely associated with the Galápagos Islands, these seabirds range across the eastern tropical Pacific. They are known for their bright blue feet, a trait shaped by both diet and sexual selection. The color comes from carotenoid pigments obtained through fish such as sardines and anchovies. In both male and female, brighter feet signal better health and a stronger immune system. Males display their feet prominently during courtship, while females with more vivid pigmentation tend to produce healthier offspring. These birds hunt by diving straight into the water at high speed, using sharp eyesight to target schooling fish. Boobies stand as a reminder that evolution isn't a closed chapter—it's an ongoing process.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
