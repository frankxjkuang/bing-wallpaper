> Do you think rocks are just … well, rocks? These natural mineral combinations have done more than just sit around—they've built the Earth's crust and helped humans shape history. From Stone Age tools to the minerals powering modern civilization, rocks have been essential throughout our journey. International Rock Day celebrates this enduring impact, inviting us to explore the science of rocks, admire their natural beauty, and recognize the rich variety they add to our world.
> 
> If you're wondering where to see geology in action, Iceland is a great place to explore. Today's image takes us to Kálfshamarsvík—a secluded cove on the country's remote Skagi Peninsula. Unlike Iceland's famous black sand beaches, this cove's shore is strewn with large, smooth pebbles, while its fiery volcanic past still reveals itself in the towering cliffs. Here, evidence of volcanic activity is on full display in the form of rare hexagonal basalt columns. These sea cliffs are shaped into natural sculptures so symmetrical that they look almost human-made. These striking formations were created around 2 million years ago, when thick basalt lava cooled slowly, contracting and cracking into geometric shapes that form near-perfect hexagons. Though Iceland is full of volcanic marvels, formations like these are rare, making this quiet cove truly remarkable.

<summary>Description</summary>

> There's something about the way animals move through the grasslands of the Maasai Mara, bathed in golden rays, that makes you pause and simply watch. This stretch of savanna in southwestern Kenya teems with wildlife—from elephants stomping through bushes to cheetahs scanning the horizon. Yet sometimes it's the smaller creatures that grab attention—like the Thomson's gazelles featured in today's image.
> 
> Known as 'tommies,' Thomson's gazelles are among the fastest animals in Africa, reaching speeds of up to 50 miles per hour. They thrive in the Mara's short grass plains, which provide a clear view of approaching predators. Though adults may seem to be grazing peacefully, their ears are always tuned to nearby movements.
> 
> Mating occurs year-round, peaking just before the rainy season. Males hold territories, waiting for females to pass through. After a five- to six-month gestation period, the female gives birth to one fawn, weighing around 4 to 6 pounds. For the first few weeks, the small gazelle stays hidden most of the day with the mother returning briefly to nurse. These early days are crucial as the young learn to run and blend in. Despite their delicate appearance, tommies are tough. Many join the great migration during the dry season, relying on their agility and the awareness of wildebeests and zebras to evade danger in search of greener plains.

> We are living in a full house, and it is getting fuller. With 8.2 billion people and counting, World Population Day highlights how that growth affects cities, food, and the future. First observed in 1989, the day focuses on how unchecked population growth affects sustainability. The event was inspired by Five Billion Day in 1987, which marked the approximate date when the global population hit that milestone. As cities expand, green spaces shrink, and agriculture competes for limited land and water resources. But there is a way forward—investing in education, improving access to healthcare, and building smarter cities can balance growth with sustainability.
> 
> On a global scale, India remains the most populous country in 2025 with over 1.46 billion people, followed by China at 1.41 billion. The United States trails with around 339 million, though its growth is slowing and aging populations are becoming a new challenge. Tokyo, the world's largest city with around 37.2 million people, illustrates the realities of high-density urban life: overcrowded spaces, transport congestion, and rising demand for services. World Population Day is more than a head count—it's a call for better planning and long-term thinking to ensure future generations can thrive on a planet with finite resources.

> The Bahamas comes alive with color, music, and pride today as the nation marks its Independence Day. First recorded by Europeans in 1492 when Christopher Columbus arrived, the islands were initially under Spanish rule. They later came briefly under American control before becoming a British colony. After decades of legal negotiations and a growing push for self-governance, the Bahamas transitioned to full independence on this day in 1973.
> 
> In the lead-up to July 10, Bahamians across the archipelago take part in spirited celebrations, including National Pride Day, ecumenical services, and community walks and runs. These events shine a spotlight on the nation's vibrant culture, heritage, and deep sense of patriotism. And what better backdrop for such festivities than the breathtaking turquoise waters that surround the islands? The shallow, white sandbanks reflect sunlight in a way that gives the ocean its signature electric-blue glow, pictured here. Whether you're snorkeling among coral reefs, watching fireworks from a beachfront, or cruising the Exuma Cays under the golden sun, it seems the ocean sparkles just a little brighter on Independence Day.

> Argentina, a nation of sweeping pampas, rich culture, and a bold identity, celebrates its Independence Day today. This pivotal date marks the moment in 1816 when delegates from across the region gathered in the city of San Miguel de Tucumán to declare freedom from Spanish colonial rule. The road to independence was not easy; it followed years of internal struggles and revolutions influenced by global movements, including the American and French revolutions. But the resolve of the Argentine people prevailed.
> 
> Since gaining independence, Argentina has taken important steps in shaping its national identity. The drafting of its first constitution in 1853 established a framework for democratic governance that continues to influence its political system. The country has also made notable contributions to global culture and sports. It has offered the world literary figures like Jorge Luis Borges, a rich culinary tradition centered on asado (a traditional barbecue), and legendary athletes such as Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi. Constitución railway station in Buenos Aires, pictured here, is a historic hub that reflects Argentina's drive for growth, connectivity, and the spirit of unity that emerged during a transformative era.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Italy's Dolomites don't just tower; they enchant, turning every trail into a story. Fondly known as the 'Pale Mountains,' the Dolomites derive their name from dolomite—a carbonate mineral. Set in the northern Italian Alps, the range spans over 345,000 acres and boasts 18 soaring peaks that rise above 9,500 feet. These mountains feature sheer cliffs, lofty walls, and a maze of narrow, winding valleys.
> 
> Amid the dramatic landscape of the Dolomites lies one of its most spectacular peaks, Seceda, featured in today's image. With a height of around 8,200 feet, it offers the highest panoramic viewpoint in Val Gardena, a scenic valley in the province of South Tyrol. A short cable car ride takes you to the summit, bypassing what would otherwise be a strenuous hike. Once at the top, you're greeted by a stunning sweep of the Dolomites' iconic jagged ridgelines. On a clear day, you might even spot Austria's tallest mountain, the Großglockner, located more than 90 miles away.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Graceful, powerful, and impossible to miss—the northern gannet is the largest seabird on the waters of the North Atlantic. It spends most of its time gliding over open seas and returning to land only to breed. These seabirds, known for their vast and noisy breeding colonies, called gannetries, nest on steep cliffs, remote rocky islands, and sea stacks that rise from the ocean.
> 
> Few birds hunt as dramatically as the northern gannet, which dives straight into the sea, as seen in today's image. Spotting prey from heights of up to 100 feet, the bird folds its wings and hits the water at speeds of over 60 mph. Its streamlined body, reinforced skull, and built-in shock absorbers, such as spongy bone plates and air sacs beneath the skin, make these high-impact dives both powerful and safe. Once underwater, the gannet uses its wings and webbed feet to swim after fish, diving as deep as 70 feet and staying submerged for up to 30 seconds. Its forward-facing eyes provide excellent depth perception, while hidden nostrils prevent water from rushing in during those lightning-fast descents.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
