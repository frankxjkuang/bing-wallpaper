<summary>Description</summary>

> The Roman bridge of Córdoba, in the ancient Spanish city’s historic center, has been rebuilt several times over the centuries. For 2,000 years it was the city’s only bridge across the Guadalquivir River, originally built in the first century BCE during the expansion of the Roman Empire. Much of the current bridge dates from reconstruction in the 8th century following the Moorish conquest, a period when hundreds of mosques and palaces were built, and Córdoba became one of Europe's largest cities and a center of learning and culture.
> 
> While it has seen centuries of traffic, the bridge is now only open to pedestrians, following the opening of the Miraflores Bridge in 2004. If it looks familiar, you might have spotted it standing in as part of the fictional city of Volantis in 'Game of Thrones.'

> Welcome to the spectacular Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park, on the Indonesian island of Java, famous for stunning sunrises and its dramatic landscape. Here, a massive ancient volcano erupted thousands of years ago and inside its collapsed crater, more volcanoes formed.
> 
> To the left, spewing smoke and steam, is Mount Bromo, one of the most iconic sites in East Java, which has erupted at least four times in the last 20 years. In the forefront of the picture, with trees creeping up the sides, is Mount Batok, which is no longer active, while Java's highest mountain (and active volcano) Semeru, is visible in the background. The Tengger Sand Sea, a vast area of fine volcanic sand, wraps around five volcanoes inside the caldera. No wonder this massive national park is sometimes referred to as the land of sand and fire.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This sleepy-looking Javan tree frog, which is only found on the Indonesian island of Java, is the perfect mascot for National Frog Month. While not everyone is a fan, frogs play a critical role in the food chain, eating pests like mosquitoes, flies, spiders, and even mice.
> 
> It is estimated that at least 200 species of frogs have gone extinct in the last five decades and there are fears hundreds more will follow. So, this April, let's take a moment to learn more about these little amphibians and ways to save them. Even the smallest changes, such as being more wary of how we dispose of our trash, can be immensely beneficial for this important species.

<summary>Description</summary>

> These whitewater rapids are found in Upper Austria, where the Steyr River crashes down from the barren Totes Gebirge (the Dead Mountains) through this verdant landscape. When it comes to the ancient town of Steyr, at the foot of the Alps, it will meet the Enns River, which flows into the Danube.
> 
> What gives the Steyr that stunning blue hue? The answer is found in the mountains themselves. When there's rainfall or the surrounding snow melts, eroded sediment flows into the river. Heavier sediment sinks to the bottom and finer sediment stays suspended in the water. Sunlight is scattered or reflected by the sediment, allowing us to see a vibrant shade of blue, as the Steyr crashes through this lush landscape.

> Peacock feathers, multicolored and radiant, are instantly recognizable. Their signature 'eyespots' flash in the light when a male displays its tail plumage for a nearby female, known as a 'peahen.'
> 
> The shimmering, iridescent effect is due to the tiny, crystal-like structures of the peacock’s feathers. As the feathers shift, so does the color. This brilliant show is all done to attract a mate. When mating season is over, males lose their feathers, making it easy for us to collect them for display, art, or simply a reminder of nature's beauty.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today is Manatee Appreciation Day and, given their sweet and friendly nature, it's hard not to love them. These gentle giants slowly graze through rivers and coastal waters for up to seven hours a day, eating seagrasses and other aquatic plants. They do have teeth, but fear not, they are flat molars used for grinding up vegetation.
> 
> Manatees are interested in humans, but their curiosity puts them at risk of collisions with boats. Their numbers dwindled to a few hundred in the 1970s but, thanks to conservation efforts, there are now more than 6,000 manatees in the US. Protecting our vulnerable wildlife is crucial if we want to be able to appreciate them for years to come.
