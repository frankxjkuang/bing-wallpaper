<summary>Description</summary>

> Amid dusky hues, lighthouses mark where a Great Lake meets a river. Two piers were built on Lake Michigan, one either side of the mouth of the St. Joseph River to help protect ships sailing upstream. In the early 20th century, a lighthouse was built at the end of each pier; the St. Joseph North Pier Inner and Outer Lights, pictured here.
> 
> Congress designated August 7 as National Lighthouse Day in 1989 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Lighthouse Act and to celebrate these iconic structures. Lighthouses not only mark hazards, and safe entries to harbors; these striking buildings also add a touch of romance to coastal scenes and shine a light onto our maritime history.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we're at Molokini Crater. This pleasant crescent in the Pacific Ocean lies in the 'Alalākeiki Channel between the Hawaiian islands of Maui and Kaho'olawe. The islet is all that remains of a volcano that erupted about 230,000 years ago. According to Hawaiian mythology, Pele the fire goddess was in love with a man named Mo'o. The trouble was that Mo'o was in love with another woman. Pele's revenge was typically violent: She cut her rival in two, her body becoming Molokini, while her head became Pu'u Olai, a cinder cone on Maui.
> 
> Molokini Crater these days is a prime scuba and snorkeling destination; the islet's crescent shape protects divers from waves and currents, allowing them to enjoy the reef. This habitat is home to at least 250 species of fish, including black triggerfish and parrotfish, as well as 38 species of hard coral, and some 100 species of algae. So, come on in, the water's lovely. Just be sure not to anger Pele.

> Carved by nature over centuries, the Three Natural Bridges tower over a deep gorge in Wulong Karst. This part of China is known for its karst landscape, which includes towering arches, extensive caves, and other rock formations. These limestone bridges are named after three dragons: Tianlong (Sky Dragon), Heilong (Black Dragon), and Qinglong (Azure Dragon), which is the tallest at 922 feet. Visitors can explore the mossy gorge beneath and the wider Wulong Karst National Geology Park, including the 9,337-foot Furong Cave with its huge limestone stalactites. Standing beneath these magnificent natural bridges, you can't help but be humbled by the sheer power of time and nature.

> In 1956, businessman and conservationist Laurance Rockefeller saw the beauty of St. John, one of the US Virgin Islands in the Caribbean, and knew it had to be preserved. He donated more than 5,000 acres of land to the National Park Service, and today we're marking the 68th anniversary of Virgin Islands National Park. Covering about 60% of St. John and 5,650 acres of submerged lands, the park boasts stunning white-sand beaches, coral reefs, and historic sites.

> Every Saturday, the largest artificial lake in Bangladesh comes to life with colors and flavors. Kaptai Lake in Rangamati District is home to the floating market of seasonal fruit seen in today's image. The lake was created in the early 1960s to generate hydropower, submerging not just land and the palace of the king of the Chakmas, Bangladesh's largest ethnic minority group, but a way of life, displacing 100,000 people. Sixty years on and the landscape has changed. This buoyant bazaar has become a livelihood, as farmers navigate their wooden vessels along the bank to engage with eager buyers. You leave with a bag full of fresh fruit or just a bunch of unforgettable memories, whatever floats your boat.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
