<summary>Description</summary>

> Big ears, bigger hearts—elephants are more than just icons of the wild. Every year on August 12, we celebrate World Elephant Day—a global movement to raise awareness about the majestic giants that roam places like Amboseli National Park in Kenya, pictured here. What makes elephants so extraordinary isn't just their size; it's their minds. These animals have incredible memories. Matriarchs, the oldest females, can recall the locations of water sources from decades past, and they use that knowledge to lead their herds through tough times. Their social bonds run just as deep. Elephants live in close-knit families, mourn their dead, and have even been observed comforting one another during hard times.
> 
> But even in protected spaces like Amboseli, elephants face threats. Habitat loss, climate change, and the illegal ivory trade continue to take a toll. World Elephant Day is more than a celebration; it's a reminder that without our help, even these mighty animals could quietly disappear. So, as you admire this African elephant herd in the image today, remember: each elephant carries a lifetime of memories and a future worth fighting for.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Tucked into the northern Italian Alps, the village of Santa Maddalena is a postcard-perfect hamlet in South Tyrol's valley of Val di Funes. With its iconic church steeple set against the jagged peaks of the Dolomites—a mountain range in the Alps—it's one of the most photographed spots in the region. The Dolomites themselves—a UNESCO World Heritage Site—rise dramatically behind the village, their pale limestone faces glowing pink at sunset in a phenomenon locals call 'enrosadira.'
> 
> Santa Maddalena is small, quiet, and deeply rooted in local Ladin and Tyrolean traditions. Wooden chalets dot the green hills, and cows graze in meadows that seem painted into place. Although it feels remote, the village is a gateway to some of the Dolomites' best hiking, including trails through Puez-Odle Nature Park. In winter, it's a peaceful base for snowshoeing and cross-country skiing. Visitors come not for crowds or nightlife, but for silence, scenery, and a sense of timelessness. Santa Maddalena is where nature and culture meet in harmony—no filter needed.

<summary>Description</summary>

> With a roar that echoes across the plains, lions have long captured the human imagination. On August 10, World Lion Day invites us to celebrate these iconic big cats while raising awareness about their declining numbers and the urgent need for conservation.
> 
> One of the best places to witness lions in the wild is Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya. Nestled in the heart of East Africa, this vast savanna is home to around 850 to 900 lions. The reserve's rich ecosystem and seasonal wildebeest migration offer a front-row seat to the drama of lion life—from territorial battles to cooperative hunts. But Maasai Mara is more than a wildlife haven; it's a model for community-led conservation. Local Maasai communities work alongside conservationists to protect both lions and their ancestral lands, showing that coexistence is not only possible but powerful. On World Lion Day, let's honor these majestic animals by supporting efforts that ensure their survival—for the health of ecosystems and the heritage of future generations.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Each year on August 9, the United Nations observes the International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples—a moment to recognize the resilience, wisdom, and cultural richness of Indigenous communities around the globe. In the US, this day invites reflection on the histories and contributions of Native American nations, while also encouraging solidarity with Indigenous peoples worldwide.
> 
> One striking example of Indigenous heritage is found across the Pacific in New Zealand. Carved into the cliffs of Lake Taupō, the Ngātoroirangi Mine Bay Māori Rock Carvings stand as a powerful tribute to Māori ancestors. Created by artist Matahi Whakataka-Brightwell, these towering figures are accessible only by water, symbolizing both reverence and resilience. They remind us that Indigenous cultures are not relics of the past—they are living, evolving, and deeply connected to the land.
> 
> As we honor this day, let's commit to listening, learning, and supporting Indigenous rights—both at home and abroad. Whether through education, advocacy, or cultural exchange, every action helps preserve the voices that have long protected our planet.

<summary>Description</summary>

> No voice is loud enough to drown out the roar of Iguazú Falls. But it's not just the sound. The sheer presence of this natural wonder is overwhelming as it straddles the border between Argentina and Brazil. This vast waterfall system stretches nearly 2 miles and features more than 270 individual cascades, each offering a unique display of tumbling water and shimmering mist.
> 
> Today's image captures one of the spectacular sights on the Argentine side—the Three Musketeers Falls, a trio of powerful streams plunging side by side into the Iguazú River below, framed by lush subtropical rainforest. Interestingly, although the falls are located in Argentina, they are only visible and accessible from the Brazilian side.
> 
> The falls are part of Iguazú National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that protects the region's rich biodiversity and offers visitors a network of trails and catwalks for panoramic views and close-up encounters with the thundering water. Open your senses to nature's wonders—and return its generosity. Leave no trace and take only memories with you.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Before GPS told ships where to go, lighthouses lit the way—each with its own flash pattern so sailors could figure out where they were, even in total darkness. It's National Lighthouse Day, a perfect excuse to give these coastal workhorses some credit. In 1789, Congress passed a law to make sure all lighthouses were taken care of by the federal government. Whether you're a history buff, coastal explorer, or just into old engineering, today is a great day to learn more about lighthouses or visit one with your friends and family.
> 
> Like many lighthouses around the world, Florida's Gasparilla Island Lights still hold their ground. The Gasparilla Island Rear Range Light, seen in today's image, has had quite a journey. Originally assembled in Delaware, it found its forever home here in 1927 but was decommissioned by the Coast Guard in 2014. The lighthouse was restored to its former glory in 2017 and was switched on again in 2018. Today, it blinks white every six seconds. Both lights are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The lighthouse grounds and museum are open to visitors seasonally, offering insights into the area's shipping past.

<summary>Description</summary>

> No road signs, no souvenir stands—just 11 miles of mud, cliffs, and sweeping views leading to one of Hawaii's most remote beaches. Kalalau Beach, at the end of Kauai's Kalalau Trail, is where tired feet meet a sandy reward. The only land access is the trail itself, a rugged trek through valleys and along coastal cliffs. During summer, some arrive by kayak, but all visitors need permits to stay.
> 
> Long before camping permits and composting toilets, this remote stretch supported generations of Native Hawaiians. Thanks to freshwater streams and fertile soil, early Hawaiians farmed taro (a root vegetable widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions) in stone terraces. Fishing, farming, and a deep spiritual connection to the land (āina) shaped daily life. Remnants of temples and house sites still lie hidden in the valley's folds. By the 1920s, most residents had left due to disease, Western contact, and shifting land use. In recent decades, off-the-grid seekers sought refuge here until state protections were implemented. Today, Kalalau is both sacred and scenic—a place where history lingers with every crashing wave.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
