> As National Park Week rolls on, let's turn our attention to Kenai Fjords National Park, a gem on Alaska's Kenai Peninsula. Stretching over 1,000 square miles, this landscape features fjords, river valleys, and alpine landscapes. More than half of the terrain is blanketed in ice. Throughout the 20th century, the park's glaciers have receded, uncovering new land for plant and animal life to take root. From ancient Sitka spruces to delicate fireweed shoots and moss carpeting the forest floor, plant life in Kenai Fjords flourishes. The park is also home to diverse terrestrial and marine mammals, including timber wolves, porcupines, Canadian lynxes, and cetaceans like orcas and fin whales. It also hosts a variety of birds, such as bald eagles and Peale's peregrine falcons.
> 
> Kenai Fjords isn't just about stunning landscapes and flourishing wilderness—it's also a place rich with human history. For thousands of years, Alaska Natives have called this region home, leaving behind traces of their lives in the land. Within the national park, the past still lingers—from the camps left by Alaska Native Sugpiaq people once scattered along the coastline to the remnants of old mining camps in Nuka Bay.

<summary>Description</summary>

> 'All the world's a stage ...' and only a few have shaped that stage like William Shakespeare. Every April 23, we celebrate Shakespeare Day, honoring one of England's greatest playwrights and poets. This date is special as it marks both his birth and death. Born in 1564, Shakespeare revolutionized English literature with unforgettable works like 'Hamlet,' 'Macbeth,' and 'Romeo and Juliet.' Four centuries after his death, his influence remains undeniable—his stories continue to captivate, challenge, and inspire.
> 
> With today's image, we can step inside Shakespeare's Globe in London, a faithful reconstruction of the original 1599 theater where the Bard's plays once thrilled Elizabethan audiences. The original Globe, built by Shakespeare's acting company, the Lord Chamberlain's Men, was destroyed by fire in 1613 when a cannon misfired during a performance of 'Henry VIII.' With an open-air stage, wooden benches, and a standing 'groundlings' area, the modern Globe is as close as one can get to experiencing Shakespeare's plays as his audience did.

<summary>Description</summary>

> On Earth Day, let's journey to one of nature's most stunning displays of geothermal power—Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. The largest hot spring in the US, it spans 370 feet across and reaches temperatures of 160°F. This geothermal marvel is fueled by the immense heat of the massive Yellowstone volcano beneath the surface. Its vivid rings of blue, green, yellow, and orange are created by heat-loving microorganisms—called thermophiles—that thrive in the mineral-rich waters.
> 
> Yellowstone's geothermal activity not only fuels its geysers and hot springs, but also demonstrates a model for sustainable energy. Unlike fossil fuels, geothermal energy provides a continuous and renewable energy source. As we celebrate Earth Day, the theme 'Our Power, Our Planet' highlights the need for cleaner energy solutions. Yellowstone National Park's geothermal forces showcase Earth's untapped potential—one that could help reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change. The Grand Prismatic Spring serves as a reminder that our planet holds immense power. The challenge is using it wisely for a sustainable future.

> Imagine standing under a sky so dark that the Milky Way stretches across it like a luminous ribbon. This is the experience that International Dark Sky Week aims to bring back. Every April, during the week of the new moon (this year from April 21 to 27), we are invited to turn off our lights and gaze at the stars. The event was initiated by Jennifer Barlow, a high school student in 2003, to combat light pollution. One of the best places to experience the night sky's beauty is Joshua Tree National Park in southeastern California, an International Dark Sky Park. Here, the absence of artificial light allows visitors to see the stars as our ancestors once did. Did you know that light pollution prevents us from seeing most of the stars in the Milky Way? By reducing it, we can reconnect with the universe's beauty and wonder.

> Today is a special day for billions of Christians worldwide—a time of renewal, celebration, and traditions. Easter, also called Pascha or Resurrection Sunday, commemorates the resurrection of Jesus Christ as described in the New Testament. It's also a time for festive traditions, from sunrise services to Easter egg hunts and, of course, the beloved Easter Bunny.
> 
> The origins of the Easter Bunny are unclear, but historians believe German settlers introduced the tradition to America in the 1700s. In German folklore, an egg-laying hare called 'Osterhase' visited children and left behind decorated eggs representing good fortune and new beginnings. Over time, this tradition evolved into Easter baskets filled with chocolates, jellybeans, and marshmallows. Whether you're enjoying a festive feast, decorating eggs, or simply soaking in the beauty of spring, may your Easter be filled with joy and love!

> Imagine a world without the pyramids, the Great Wall, or ancient cave cities—hard to picture, right? That's why April 18 is the International Day for Monuments and Sites, an event recognized by UNESCO dedicated to protecting cultural treasures worldwide. This day is all about celebrating our history, raising awareness about endangered sites, and making sure future generations can enjoy them too.
> 
> A remarkable example is Göreme Historical National Park in Cappadocia, Türkiye. It's famous for its 'fairy chimneys'—towering rock formations shaped by volcanic ash and erosion over thousands of years. People carved homes, churches, and entire underground cities into these soft rock formations, some dating back to the 4th century. Today, it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting visitors from around the world. Whether it's ancient castles, temples, or hidden underground cities, this day reminds us to appreciate and protect the landmarks that tell the story of humanity.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
