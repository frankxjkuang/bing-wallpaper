> We're really buzzing: Today is World Bee Day, a chance to celebrate these industrious insects and the vital role they play in biodiversity and agriculture. Bees come in a range of sizes, from just 0.08 inches all the way up to 2.5 inches, and there are over 20,000 known species. One of the most important pollinators, they help keep trees, flowers, and crops alive, helping to secure food chains as well as boosting biodiversity. It's no overstatement to say that bees are vital for humans' survival.
> 
> Honey bees, like the one in today's image, construct nests from wax and produce honey to sustain the colony through the winter months. Humans have been keeping bees in artificial hives for around 10,000 years.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Perched on the rugged cliffs of the Italian Riviera, Vernazza is one of the five villages of the Cinque Terre area of northwestern Italy. Here, ancient buildings stand along the coastline of the Ligurian Sea, and life is filled with the hustle and bustle of the fishing industry. Vernazza got its name from the indigenous wine, 'vernaccia,' meaning 'local' or 'ours.' One of the best-known monuments in the area is the medieval Doria Castle, built as a defensive fortress to protect the village from frequent pirate attacks. Thanks to the construction of the Genoa–La Spezia rail line in the 19th century, the village became more accessible by land. The car-free cobblestone streets are ideal for walking around. While here, you might want to visit the Chapel of Santa Marta and the Sanctuary of Madonna di Reggio. Vernazza is sometimes described as the pearl of the Cinque Terre with its natural port, colorful houses, and green terraces overlooking a sparkling sea.

> Today, on Endangered Species Day, we unite in a collective effort for conservation. Currently, there are over 44,000 species that are threatened with extinction. Among the world's most endangered animals are Javan and black rhinos, mountain gorillas, and Hawksbill turtles.
> 
> Today, let us take you to the Tarangire National Park in Tanzania, where African elephants roam freely. These gentle giants are characterized by their large, flapping ears, long trunks, and curved tusks. They live in small family groups led by a matriarch and while they are known to noisily trumpet, they also communicate over distances through low-frequency sound waves. Unfortunately, threats like habitat loss and poaching have left them on the brink of extinction. Endangered Species Day highlights efforts to protect all endangered animal and plant species worldwide, big and small.

> Happy International Day of Light! Held on May 16, it marks the anniversary of the invention of the laser by the American physicist and engineer Theodore Maiman in 1960. This pioneering creation helped revolutionize fields from communications to health care and lasers are now found in everything from printers and barcode scanners to surgical devices. Today's event also celebrates light's presence in every aspect of human existence, from art and culture to science and technology.

In 2010 it filled the Great Hall of the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing with illuminated fog. A grid of lights partitioned the haze into the primary colors of red, green, and blue, blending seamlessly at intersections to create transitional hues of cyan, magenta, and yellow. Gallery visitors relied solely on intersecting hues of colored fields to navigate the fog.

> With deep rocky canyons and high ancient sea ledges, Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico boasts some of the most unique rock formations in the world. Hidden beneath its desert scenery are more than 119 caves—formed when sulfuric acid dissolved the surrounding limestone. This national park, founded on this day in 1930, is also home to North America's largest underground chamber—the Big Room. From colossal stalactite formations hanging like chandeliers to stalagmite structures reaching for the ceiling, every nook and cranny is a masterpiece crafted over millions of years. This UNESCO World Heritage Site also organizes events like bat flight viewings, which allow visitors to watch thousands of bats as they swoop in and out of the cavern. Are you ready to explore the depths?
