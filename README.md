> What's more creative than a young mind? This World Children's Day, let's celebrate the boundless imagination of kids and the ideas they bring to life. A UNICEF initiative, this day is a global day of action for children, by children, which marks the UN's adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Kids are raising their voices on issues ranging from conflict and climate change to mental health and discrimination, in a bid to influence the future.
> 
> Featured in today's image is the giant land art painting 'Beyond Crisis' in Leysin, Switzerland. It was created by French contemporary artist Saype in 2020 in response to the pandemic. Saype is renowned for his ultra-realistic giant nature paintings—this fresco spanned over 32,000 square feet—made using biodegradable paint. Through the eyes of a little girl gazing at the horizon, the artist envisioned a more united and humane world. The arc of figures she draws serves as a powerful reminder that, in times of crisis, we must focus on what lies ahead together.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Ready for a coastal adventure? Welcome to Tasman National Park in Tasmania, an island state of Australia about 150 miles off its southeastern coast. Spanning more than 41 square miles, this park features dramatic cliffs and distinctive columns of dolerite rock. Tasmans Arch, seen in today's image, is a standout example. Shaped over time by the Tasman Sea, it was once the roof of a massive sea cave. The sea's pressure, combined with air, sand, and stones, slowly pried open the vertical cracks in the cliff, dislodging chunks of rock. The cave kept growing, deepening, and lengthening, until it eventually gave way, leaving behind this towering natural bridge. Tasmans Arch is named after the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman, who also lends his name to the state of Tasmania.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> With waves crashing against its sturdy base and a stormy sea swirling around, this lighthouse in Porthcawl, on the south coast of Wales, has been standing resilient since 1860. At 30 feet tall, Porthcawl Lighthouse, designed by the eminent engineer James Walker, is often pictured being battered by waves when storms hit. The town's rugged coastline, with its hidden rocky coves, has always posed a perilous challenge to sailors. Porthcawl Lighthouse was built to help guide the increasing maritime traffic along the Bristol Channel. This cast-iron lighthouse was the last one in the UK to be powered by coal and gas. Although it was converted to electric power in 1997, the lighthouse still maintains its historical charm.

> Striking appearance, strong presence, and impressive antlers—meet the red deer, photographed in the ancient forests of Glen Affric, one of Scotland's most beautiful valleys. Found across Europe, Asia, and parts of North Africa, this species is Britain's largest land mammal and an integral part of the Caledonian pinewoods, Scotland's coniferous forests. From featuring in cave art found throughout Europe to medieval hunting traditions, red deer have always held a special place in the human imagination. In many parts of the world, their image is synonymous with the wild, free spirit of nature. Glen Affric, with its lochs, moorlands, and mountains, provides the perfect habitat for these magnificent creatures. This national nature reserve is also popular with hikers, climbers, and nature enthusiasts.
> 
> The Scottish red deer is a subspecies that is slightly smaller than its counterparts in continental Europe. This species exhibits insular dwarfism, a process where large animals evolve to have smaller bodies over many generations.

> If you've ever dreamed of walking on water, or something close to it, the Wadden Sea is the place for you. Tracing over 300 miles along the coast of the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark, this UNESCO World Heritage Site offers a unique landscape of tidal flats and wetlands. In fact, it is the world's largest unbroken intertidal zone—underwater at high tide and exposed at low tide—of sand and mud flats. The area is also a playground for aquatic species such as houting fish, brown trout, and white-beaked dolphins, and is home to birds like waders and herons.
> 
> Pictured here is the Wadden Sea coast in Friesland, Netherlands. This coast is dotted with charming fishing villages and medieval churches. Mudflat hiking is a recreational pastime here—the Dutch call it wadlopen. As the tide recedes, mud-trampers can walk across the seabed, squishing through the mud and wading through shallow waters. Whether you're up for a wadlopen challenge or a seal-spotting safari, there's plenty of adventure to be found here. Just don't forget your boots—things are bound to get a little messy!

<summary>Description</summary>

> As twilight descends today, Chiang Mai, Thailand's second-largest city, will come alive with thousands of glowing lanterns for Yi Peng. Held on the full moon of the second month of the Lanna lunar calendar, this celebration is about letting go of negativity and embracing new beginnings. The highlight of the festival is the release of 'khom loi' or 'khom loy'—floating paper lanterns—into the night sky, which becomes a sea of warm, golden lights. People often write their hopes and dreams on the lanterns. They gather around temples and palaces to send their wishes skyward, hoping for good fortune in the year to come.
> 
> In addition to the lantern release, the city hosts vibrant parades, traditional dance performances, and stunning decorations. Yi Peng coincides with Loy Krathong, another festival where small, intricately crafted baskets, decorated with banana leaves, incense, and candles, are floated down rivers. Together, these festivals create a spectacle that draws visitors from across the world to witness the illumination of Chiang Mai.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Known for its rows of pastel houses that stretch down to the Mediterranean Sea, Manarola, seen in today's image, is a picturesque village on the Italian Riviera. Perched on the rugged cliffs of the Ligurian coast, it's one of the five villages that make up Cinque Terre National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The name 'Manarola' might have evolved from the Latin 'Magna rota,' which means 'large wheel,' a nod to the village's historical mill wheel.
> 
> Believed to be the oldest village in the Cinque Terre, dating to 1338, Manarola's history is rooted in fishing and winemaking. Sciacchetrà, a dessert wine unique to this area, has long been immortalized in the verses of Italian poets. Take a walk along the Via dell'Amore, or 'Path of Love'—a scenic coastal trail connecting Manarola to its neighboring village, Riomaggiore—and you can sense the romance and charm that defines this region. Legend has it that the footpath became a meeting place for lovers from the two villages. Time slows down when you're in Manarola, and the magic of the country's coastal heritage comes to life.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
