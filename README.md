<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to Florence, the cradle of the Renaissance. Let the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore transport you through time. More than just a church, this Gothic structure, with its red-tiled dome, is steeped in centuries of history. Built over an older cathedral, construction began in 1296 under the supervision of architect Arnolfo di Cambio. Italian architect Filippo Brunelleschi engineered its dome, the largest brick dome ever constructed. Its completion in 1436 was the final stage of the cathedral's construction. It's not just the outside that dazzles; inside there are artistic treasures to discover, from Giorgio Vasari's fresco 'The Last Judgment' to Paolo Uccello's intricate clock face. The cathedral complex is also home to the Baptistery, a small basilica, and Giotto's Campanile, a free-standing bell tower.
> 
> Step inside, and you're walking on history—every visit gives a glimpse of the past and a demonstration of human potential.

> Dive deep beneath the waves surrounding the Banggai Islands in Indonesia and meet the Banggai cardinalfish. Cardinalfish have tiny, shimmery bodies with black vertical stripes and white-edged fins, which help to disguise them. Unlike some finned creatures that migrate long distances, these pint-sized fish inhabit a small world, rarely straying far from their local reefs.
> 
> Each young cardinalfish begins life being guarded by their fathers, who carry the eggs in their mouths for up to 30 days to shield them from the aquatic perils. Within these jaws, young fish embark on a silent metamorphosis, soon to emerge, ready to explore the currents. In their early stages, they form dense schools for protection against predators and hide among the spines of sea urchins and anemones. The diet of these opportunistic feeders primarily consists of small fish, crustaceans, and plankton. Their existence whispers tales of resilience—a creature to cherish and protect for the spectacle of life it presents.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Amid the arid expanse of the Mojave Desert in Nevada lies Valley of Fire State Park. Named after its red Aztec Sandstone, an Early Jurassic formation made from ancient sand dunes, the park stretches across 46,000 acres. Featured on our homepage is one of its highlights, Fire Wave, a geological marvel that appears like a frozen wave with its red, pink, and white stripes.
> 
> In the park, you will also come across mysterious petroglyphs, rock carvings left by the Ancestral Puebloans, farmers from the nearby Moapa Valley. It is likely they practiced hunting and performed religious ceremonies in this area. If you are a history buff, you might want to try and decode the messages carved on the rock faces. This forbidding landscape is also home to ancient, petrified trees, natural sandstone arches, and narrow slot canyons carved by water over millions of years.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Atop Kelimutu, a volcano on the Indonesian island of Flores, sit three lakes, each with its own hue and folklore. Volcanic vents deep within the Earth release steam and gas that alter the lakes' mineral compositions, creating different colors, which can change independently. The westernmost lake, Tiwu Ata Bupu (Lake of Old People), not pictured, normally has a dark blue hue. Meanwhile, Tiwu Ko'o Fai Nuwa Muri (Lake of Young Men and Maidens), tends to be light green or light blue and Tiwu Ata Polo (Bewitched or Enchanted Lake) can be red, dark green, blue or brown. The local Lio people revere these lakes, believing them to be the resting place of souls.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh. This South Asian megacity on the Ganges Delta, home to over 10.2 million people, is one of the world's most densely populated cities. Dhaka has been nicknamed 'City of Mosques' because of the hundreds of elegant minarets that dot the city. Here, the cheers from football and cricket stadiums fill the air, and colorfully decorated rickshaws, recognized by UNESCO as an important example of cultural heritage, meander through the streets. Even by rickshaw, it might take you a while to reach your destination: Dhaka has been recognized as the world's slowest city. So, whether you're weaving through its alleys or sampling its spicy street foods, take the time to savor everything Dhaka has to offer.

> Fresh air, rustling leaves, and thousands of wildlife species—welcome to the Amazon rainforest. Covering more than 2,100,000 square miles, this South America treasure extends its branches across nine nations—Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela. Today, the Amazon is home to more than 30 million people, but it also carries secrets of lost civilizations. Archaeologists recently discovered a network of cities here dating back 2,500 years.
> 
> However, deforestation has peeled away 20% of the Amazon's cover, jeopardizing local and global climates. This forest, housing an estimated 390 billion trees, has a critical cooling effect on the planet, absorbing and storing huge amounts of carbon dioxide. World Rainforest Day highlights the need for action to protect all rainforests and help these important ecosystems continue to play a vital role in the health of our planet.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today is about honoring the tallest creatures on Earth and highlighting the importance of conservation efforts. Giraffes have fascinated travelers from around the world for a long time. These animals were once viewed as status symbols and were treasured as pets among royalty.
> 
> Featured here are reticulated giraffes, found mostly in Kenya, but also in parts of Somalia and Ethiopia. Reticulated means to resemble a network or net, and these majestic creatures are named after their coats, which feature large spots that extend onto the lower legs, tail, and face. Only around 16,000 reticulated giraffes remain in the wild, less than half of those recorded in the 1980s. Nevertheless, in recent years there has been a promising trend in northern Kenya, where populations are rebounding thanks to places like the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy. So, let's pledge to protect these creatures and their habitats.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
