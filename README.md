> This scarlet winterberry shrub is the perfect hiding place for the northern cardinal. What better spot for singing in the winter holidays? Winterberry is a deciduous holly that's native to North America and can be a modest shrub or a tree reaching up to 15 feet. The yellow and green flower clusters that bloom in spring give way to bright red berries in winter.
> 
> Cardinals winter in the Midwest and the Eastern US, brightening the dreary winter months with flashes of bold scarlet. It's only the male cardinal that sports the crimson plumage. Female cardinals are mostly light brown, with a bit of red. Some people believe sighting a cardinal is good luck or a message of support from a lost loved one.

<summary>Description</summary>

> You're maybe more likely to see a mountain goat in Montana's Glacier National Park than anywhere else in the lower 48 states. And you may not just see the goats from afar—they are accustomed to humans and will saunter right up to visitors. You're going to want to keep your distance, though: Mountain goats can deliver forceful headbutts.
> 
> These goats are excellent climbers and often can be found on high cliffs and seemingly defying gravity on the sides of mountains. That's thanks to a special split hoof that allows them to grip rocky slopes. Being plant eaters, mountain goats tend to spend most of their time grazing and looking for places to lick up much needed minerals.

> It's that time again! Grab your binoculars and bird guide and head outside to start counting. The National Audubon Society's Christmas Bird Count starts on December 14 annually and runs until January 5. Originating as an actual hunt in the 19th century, on Christmas Day in 1900 someone had the bright idea to stop killing the birds and instead just observe them.
> 
> Conducted entirely by volunteers, the Christmas Bird Count is the largest citizen science project in the world. It helps to track the health and well-being of bird populations and is vital to conservation efforts. Without it, species like the great horned owl and the gilded flicker, seen nesting in a saguaro cactus in today's photo of Arizona's Sonoran Desert, could end up being underrepresented and possibly endangered.

> This tiny, snow-dusted village is Hallstatt, in Austria's mountainous Salzkammergut region, sandwiched between the shore of Lake Hallstatt and the slopes of the Dachstein Mountains. The salt mines here are thought to be among the oldest in the world and were once the backbone of Hallstatt's economy. Today they're a popular tourist attraction—this little village draws in so many visitors that it is considered an area of over-tourism. Hallstatt has sought to limit the number of people who can visit each day.
> 
> Hallstatt's charms are so considerable that an identical recreation of the town was built in Guangdong, China, in 2011. So, if they can't squeeze you into Hallstatt, perhaps you can pop over to China's version.
