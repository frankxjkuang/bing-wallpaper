<summary>Description</summary>

> Zahara de la Sierra, a stunning whitewashed village in the hills of Cádiz province in Spain, offers a blend of history and nature in the south of the Iberian Peninsula. Perched on a rocky hilltop, the village seen in today's image overlooks the Zahara-El Gastor Reservoir and the Sierra de Grazalema Natural Park, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve since 1977. Its Moorish castle ruins and 15th-century tower reflect its history as a medieval fortress. Stroll through streets lined with flower-filled balconies, visit the church of Santa María de la Mesa, or simply relax and take in the views. Zahara is also a gateway to adventure—activities like hiking, cycling, and kayaking are only a little of what the village has to offer.
> 
> The name 'Zahara de la Sierra' was once thought to have come from 'azahar,' the Arabic word for 'citrus blossom.' However, studies suggest it comes from 'sahra,' which means 'wild' or 'barren land,' reflecting the rugged hill where the village is located. As part of Andalusia's Route of the White Villages, Zahara de la Sierra promises unforgettable experiences in a beautiful corner of Spain.

> Who says New Year's Day has to be on January 1? In Wales, the clocks turn back—figuratively—to celebrate Hen Galan, or the 'Old New Year,' on January 13. As part of this tradition, Calennig, meaning 'New Year's gift' in Welsh, plays a central role, linking the celebration to customs from the Julian calendar era. Even after most of the world switched to the Gregorian calendar in 1582, some Welsh communities clung to their old ways. Traditionally, the day involves children going door-to-door, singing songs, and offering good wishes in exchange for gifts like coins, food, or sweets. A unique feature is its clove-decorated apples. These aren't for snacking, though; they're miniature symbols of luck and prosperity.
> 
> While these old traditions have evolved in some parts of Wales, the spirit of Calennig thrives. Cities like Cardiff, the capital of Wales, have transformed the celebration into large-scale events, complete with fireworks, markets, and community gatherings. If your New Year's resolutions are already wobbling by January 13, Calennig offers a do-over. So why not embrace a little Welsh magic? Raise a toast to the joys of taking things slow or visit Ynys Llanddwyn for its lighthouse and cottages, featured in today's image. After all, in Wales, it's never too late to celebrate.

> Say hello to the crescent-tail bigeye, a fish as eye-catching as its name suggests. With large, wide eyes and a distinctive tail shaped like a crescent moon, it's hard to miss. Measuring about 20 inches long, it has a sleek body and a protruding lower jaw with small conical teeth. Its eyes are adapted to the low-light conditions of deep waters, helping it spot prey and avoid predators. This fish mainly feeds on smaller fish, crustaceans, and invertebrates, fueling its active lifestyle as it patrols the reefs and hunts for food.
> 
> You can find these fish near Lizard Island, part of the Great Barrier Reef, and throughout the Indo-Pacific region. Named by English navigator Matthew Flinders when he mapped the Australian coastline, the the Great Barrier stretches more than 1,400 miles. This UNESCO World Heritage Site hosts more than 1,500 species of fish, 400 types of coral, and various other marine creatures such as sea turtles and dugongs. If you ever go snorkeling here, keep an eye out for the crescent-tail bigeye.

<summary>Description</summary>

> An imperial city in northern central Morocco, Meknes is steeped in history. Once the capital of Morocco under Sultan Ismail Ibn Sharif of the Alawi dynasty in the 17th century, it's known for its massive walls, grand gates, and structures built to last centuries. Meknes reflects the Moroccan style of architecture, with one of its most impressive landmarks being Heri es-Swani, seen in today's image.
> 
> Heri es-Swani was originally constructed as a stable and for storing vast amounts of grain to sustain the settlement and the sultan's armies. Its design was both practical and impressive—thick walls and an innovative cooling system helped maintain the food supply. Twenty-two rows of symmetrical arches divided the space into corridors that once had vaulted ceilings. Back then, mules climbed onto the roof terrace to deliver grain, which was dropped through specially designed holes to the floor below. The structure housed more than 12,000 horses. Today, it stands as an empty shell, acting as a scenic backdrop ready to be explored. This historical monument is a must-see for anyone curious about how empires were built and fed.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Ever heard of frozen bubbles? Abraham Lake in Alberta, Canada, has them during the winter, and they're not just beautiful—they're science in action. Created in 1972, Abraham Lake is a human-made reservoir that spans more than 20 square miles along the North Saskatchewan River. Thanks to glacier-fed waters from the Rocky Mountains, the lake stays transparent even in the coldest months. Glacial meltwater carries fine sediment that scatters sunlight, while natural filtration through rocks keeps pollutants to a minimum.
> 
> The snowy season attracts photographers and visitors from around the world who are eager to capture a rare sight at Preacher's Point: bubbles. These frozen globes form when microorganisms break down dead plants and animals on the lake bed, releasing methane. As the gas rises, it gets trapped by the ice, creating layers of bubbles in various sizes and shapes. It's wild to think that they're flammable and chilling under your feet. The ice is thickest in January and February and the bubbles clearly visible. If you're planning to check it out, just remember to stick close to the shoreline for your safety.

> New year, new goals—so why not start by taking a step toward better health? On this National Take the Stairs Day, let's climb into the past. The Great Wall of China, one of the longest humanmade structures in the world, offers the perfect inspiration. Stretching more than 13,000 miles and dating back thousands of years, the ancient marvel in today's picture is a series of fortifications spanning rugged mountains, valleys, and deserts. Featuring steep trenches and watchtowers, parts of it were designed to keep invaders at bay. Hiking the Great Wall offers a unique glimpse into this historical landmark. The experience varies from well-preserved sections like Mutianyu to wild, unrestored parts such as Jiankou. Some steps are so high, they're more like steps on a ladder! Talk about a workout—taking these stairs could rival any modern fitness challenge.
> 
> The Great Wall of China isn't just a wall, but a symbol of perseverance and strength. Similarly, taking the stairs instead of the elevator is a small but empowering step toward better health. Millions of people live with chronic conditions like asthma, and by choosing the stairs, you're not just building strength, but also improving your overall health. So, the next time you face an elevator, think of the Great Wall and take the stairs. Your future self will thank you!

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
