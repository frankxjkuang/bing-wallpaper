<summary>Description</summary>

> Wave after wave of velvety hills stretch across the Palouse. This tranquil region lies in southeastern Washington, extending to the borders of Idaho and Oregon. The wheat-covered slopes shift in color with every passing season. In spring, the hills turn lush shades of green as young wheat and barley begin to grow, while summer transforms them into dry, golden browns as the crops near harvest.
> 
> Often hailed as one of Washington State's most serene natural wonders, the Palouse owes its signature rolling hills to an ancient and fascinating geological story. These dune-like hills were shaped over thousands of years—not by rivers or tectonic shifts, but by windblown dust and fine silt, known as 'loess,' carried from the arid Southwest. During the Ice Ages, glaciers from Canada ground rock into fine 'glacial flour,' which flowed into the prehistoric Glacial Lake Missoula. When ice dams broke, floods swept across eastern Washington, leaving behind layers of silt. Prevailing winds later carried that dust to this region, settling it into the hills we see today.

<summary>Description</summary>

> You don't need to be a bird expert to notice the wheatear darting across open ground. These ground-dwelling songbirds are known for their upright posture and habit of hopping or sprinting between perches. Despite the name, wheatears have nothing to do with wheat or ears—the name is a twist on the old phrase 'white arse,' pointing to the bird's distinctive white rump found in most species. The northern wheatear weighs less than an ounce, but travels thousands of miles between its summer homes in Alaska and northern Canada to its wintering grounds in Africa. Its migration route is one of the longest for a bird its size. Unlike many backyard songbirds, wheatears prefer wide-open spaces with low vegetation, where they can sprint and pounce on insects. And while most North American birders might only catch them in the far north, wheatears are widespread across Europe, Asia, and Africa.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Set at Corsica's southern edge, Bonifacio looks out across a narrow strait to Sardinia, its limestone cliffs towering above the waves. Bonifacio didn't begin as a picturesque tourist destination—it was originally established as a coastal fortification and has spent centuries guarding one of the Mediterranean's busiest sea lanes. Established in 828 CE by Boniface II of Tuscany, the commune gradually became a meeting point for traders, soldiers, and sailors—each group contributing to the evolution of the town's structure. Bonifacio is divided into two sections, with the 'vieille ville' (old town)—also known as 'la Haute Ville' (the Upper City)—standing on a high cliff within the original citadel walls. Below, the marine area lines the narrow inlet with harbors, waterfront homes, and a growing valley community.
> 
> While here, the Bonifacio Citadel is a must-see. First built in the 9th century and expanded over time, it invites visitors to wander through quiet passageways, old military buildings, and cobblestone streets. Nearby, you can explore the Marine Cemetery, climb the King of Aragon's Stairway, and visit the Bastion de l'Étendard, now home to a small museum.

> Planes, progress, and a whole lot of sky. National Aviation Day gives us a reason to pause and appreciate how aviation has shaped the modern world—and the innovators who dared to dream of flight. The national day was established in 1939 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to honor Orville Wright's contributions to aviation. Wright, born on this day in 1871, achieved the first powered, controlled flight in 1903 along with his brother Wilbur. The day is recognized as an opportunity to promote the advancement of aviation through public events and educational activities. Many aviation museums offer free or discounted entry, and airfields often hold open houses to engage the community.
> 
> The Solar Impulse project is a remarkable milestone in modern aviation. In July 2010, the Solar Impulse prototype completed a 26-hour test flight powered only by the sun. It flew through the day and night without using fuel—a key step in proving solar-powered flight was possible. Building on this, Solar Impulse 2, seen in today's image, successfully completed the first solar-powered flight around the world from 2015 to 2016, covering over 26,000 miles without burning fossil fuels. These flights show how aviation can push forward into cleaner, more sustainable territory.

<summary>Description</summary>

> There's no easing into the wild here—the Avalanche Lake Trail carves a bold path through rock scrambles, narrow ledges, and alpine serenity. Tucked away in New York's Adirondack High Peaks, this 9-acre alpine lake sits at nearly 2,900 feet between Mount Colden and Avalanche Mountain. Shaped by ancient glaciers, the lake is framed by dramatic cliffs and rugged terrain that echo its icy origins. Its most striking feature is the Trap Dike—a towering 1,200-foot rock canyon flanked by steep walls, making the lake one of the most awe-inspiring sights in the Adirondacks. Massive avalanches carved these cliffs, leaving behind the dramatic landscape that gave Avalanche Lake its name. The Avalanche Lake Trail begins at the Adirondack Loj, a well-known launch point for adventures in the High Peaks. Spanning about 9.6 miles round trip with a 1,350-foot elevation gain, the hike may seem manageable on paper—but it's the uneven terrain that truly tests your mettle.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Built to brave storms and steer ships to safety, lighthouses now glow as symbols of heritage, wonder, and connection. Each year on the third weekend of August, the International Lighthouse Lightship Weekend brings together people from around the globe to celebrate these coastal icons. The event was launched in 1998 by John Forsyth and Mike Dalrymple of Scotland's Ayr Amateur Radio Group. It aims to raise awareness about preserving lighthouses and lightships while also promoting amateur radio and encouraging international goodwill.
> 
> Among the many lighthouses that carry this legacy forward is the Lyngvig Lighthouse in Denmark, featured here. Standing over 120 feet tall, this tower was built in 1906 atop a 55-foot dune along the west coast of Jutland—the country's westernmost region. Made with a concrete foundation and brick walls, and finished with teak-framed windows and doors, the lighthouse originally required a team of three keepers. They maintained its light until 1965. It has been operating automatically ever since. Following a temporary closure in 2024 due to structural concerns, the lighthouse is now open to the public again.

> If you think bees are just out for a sting, think again. These tiny winged workers are running the world's sweetest gig—and they've got a whole day dedicated to their buzz-ness. Welcome to World Honey Bee Day, celebrated every third Saturday in August. About 35% of global food crop production relies on animal pollination, including honey bees. The value of crops pollinated by bees is estimated at hundreds of billions of dollars. Despite their superpowers, bees are in a sticky situation. Habitat loss, pesticides, disease, and climate change are making life in the hive less than ideal.
> 
> Today's image features a row of bright boxes in Italy—those are beehives. Bees use color to distinguish between hives, much like humans use house numbers. Blue, yellow, green, and red hives help reduce confusion and accidental hive invasions. On World Honey Bee Day, let's think outside the hive. Whether it's through colorful conservation, mindful eating, or planting for pollinators, there's always a way to 'bee' involved.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
