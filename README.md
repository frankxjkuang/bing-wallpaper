> Brown, round, tiny, and spiny—say hello to the European hedgehog. Our image was taken in Sussex, England, but you'll find these prickly creatures in gardens, parks, and woodland throughout Europe. Mostly nocturnal, they are welcomed by gardeners as they snack on snails and slugs. With leaves turning gold and the air getting chilly, our homepage hedgehog is all set to gain some weight for the winter.
> 
> Hedgehogs cozy up in their nests of logs and leaves and sleep away the winter blues. They slow down their heartbeats to conserve energy, helping them to survive on fat reserves until spring. Hedgehogs depend on their spines for defense against predators like foxes, badgers, and birds of prey. There are no native hedgehogs living in North America, but 17 species can be found across Europe, Asia, Africa, and New Zealand, snoozing the day away beneath bushes, leaves, and rocks and snuffling around by night.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Sky gazers have been counting down to today: a 'ring of fire' annular solar eclipse is here to darken the skies over the Americas! Solar eclipses happen when the moon passes between the sun and Earth, casting parts of Earth into shadow. In an annular solar eclipse, a halo effect is created when the moon blocks out most but not all, of the sun's light. An annulus—or ring—of light remains visible. Seen here from Doha, Qatar, in 2019, the phenomenon will appear today over the United States—traveling from Oregon to Texas before continuing to Central America and ending in South America. While the 'ring of fire' is visible only in certain areas, partial eclipses will grace parts of all 50 states.
> 
> For those fortunate enough to live on the path of this cosmic show, be cautious. Do not look directly at the eclipse without specialized eye protection. Don't hesitate to make travel plans to see it, as the US will have to wait until 2039 for the next such event.

> Come and gather around, folks! It's time to express our gratitude toward the harvesting heroes, the guardians of crops: farmers. Farmer's Day is a celebration of determination and a deep-rooted relationship with the land. From dusk to dawn throughout the seasons, farmers work tirelessly to ensure that produce shelves stay stocked. The interior northwest's Palouse region is one of the country's most fertile farming regions, with rolling hills of wheat, legumes, and canola, as seen here today. Old barns with rusty roofs and weathered wood tell tales of harvests and hardships faced by generations of farmers. So, when you eat your next meal, we encourage you to take a moment and think of the workers who produced that food from the land.

<summary>Description</summary>

> For National Fossil Day, we're looking at the mesmerizing Painted Hills, found in the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument in Oregon. Those stripes of red, tan, orange, and black were formed over tens of millions of years, the different layers in the claystone hills reflecting changes in the climate over that period. The monument itself is divided into three units, Painted Hills, Clarno, and Sheep Rock. In the latter, you'll find the Thomas Condon Visitor Center with a paleontology lab and a museum displaying hundreds of fossils. In the fossil beds, the remains of more than 100 species of mammals have been found, including saber-toothed tigers, turtles, and opossums, as well as many fossilized plant species. While the landscape might sometimes look otherworldly, it offers us a peek into Earth's dynamic and fascinating history.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The rising sun hits the twin peaks of Mount Sopris in this autumnal scene, in Colorado's Elk Mountains, in the Rockies. Known as East Sopris and West Sopris, the two summits are both 12,965 feet in elevation, towering over the town of Carbondale, in the Roaring Fork Valley. It's a common misconception that Mount Sopris was a volcano but, although magma built up beneath its surface, it never erupted. Instead, it crystallized about 10,000 feet beneath the Earth's surface, creating a massive rock-covered dome. Erosion by rain, melting snow and glacial ice then shaped it into this twin-peaked giant over tens of millions of years.
> 
> Mount Sopris was a hallowed site for Indigenous peoples, including the Ute tribes who have historically inhabited the region. The Roaring Fork and Crystal Valleys served as seasonal dwellings and hunting territories for the Parianuche and Yampa bands of the Ute people. The mountain continues to be a beloved emblem of the Colorado Rocky Mountains, drawing in visitors and adventurers alike.

> Our homepage today celebrates Indigenous Peoples' Day. In the US, the second Monday in October is dedicated to the enduring cultures that have shaped the nation. Among them are the Fremont people, who lived in and around what is now Utah, for more than 1,000 years up to 1300 CE. This broad group of communities left a lasting mark on their region with their distinctive petroglyphs, a form of ancient art chipped or carved into rock. Today, many Americans participate in Indigenous Day celebrations such as art exhibitions, traditional music, and storytelling. Locations such as Dinosaur National Monument, Fremont Indian State Park, and McKee Spring provide insights into the history of this ancient culture that lived here for centuries.
