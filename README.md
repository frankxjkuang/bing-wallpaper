> On May 4, 'Star Wars' fans celebrate Star Wars Day, a tribute to the beloved franchise created by George Lucas. The film series consists of nine movies, collectively referred to as the 'Skywalker Saga.' One of the memorable filming locations is Plaza de España in Seville, Spain, as seen in today's image. This beautiful square, with its semi-elliptical shape and stunning architecture, was used as the city of Theed on the planet Naboo. The scene where Senator Amidala arrives in Naboo, featuring Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen, was filmed here. Plaza de España's unique design, with its central building, towers, and fountain, adds a touch of magic to the Star Wars universe. This historic square, designed by Aníbal González, was originally built for the Ibero-American Exposition in 1929.

> Ever wondered what Saturn's rings look like through a telescope? Or how astronomers spot distant galaxies? International Astronomy Day is the perfect time to find out. This annual event, first launched in 1973, is all about 'Bringing Astronomy to the People'—the official theme of Astronomy Day. From local parks to astronomy clubs, museums, and observatories, visitors can enjoy activities like telescope viewings, space talks, and even moon gravity simulators.
> 
> The event started when Doug Berger, an astronomer in California, decided to take telescopes to busy public spaces rather than wait for people to visit observatories. It worked—people got hooked on stargazing! Astronomy Day is celebrated worldwide, with events in countries like Canada, Sweden, and Argentina, among many others. Today is the day to explore the universe. Find a telescope and celebrate the cosmos!

> In the lush Pantanal wetlands of Brazil, a striated heron perches on a Victoria water lily. This water bird, also known as the mangrove heron, is about 16 inches tall. It is a master of patience, waiting to ambush its prey. It uses clever tactics, such as dropping feathers or insects to lure fish. Common in the wetlands of South America, the striated heron is also found in North America, Australia, Africa, Asia, New Guinea, and the Pacific islands.
> 
> The Victoria, or giant water lily, belongs to the genus of aquatic herbs, including species like Victoria amazonica and Victoria boliviana, which can boast leaves up to 10 feet in diameter. The Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetland, is a sanctuary for wildlife and offers an extraordinary glimpse into the natural world.

> Today, while the world celebrates May Day with parades and protests, Hawaii takes a more fragrant approach—by draping itself in flowers. On May 1, Hawaii celebrates Lei Day, a tradition that honors culture, craftsmanship, and the ever-present aloha spirit, described as 'the coordination of mind and heart within each person.' Since 1928, this Hawaiian tradition has been in full bloom, with leis—or garlands made of flowers, leaves, or shells—serving as symbols of connection. The idea for Lei Day came from poet Don Blanding, who suggested a holiday dedicated to Hawaii's iconic floral garlands. Local writer Grace Tower Warren gave it its slogan, 'May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii,' and the tradition quickly took root.
> 
> What started as a single event in Honolulu has grown into a statewide celebration, with each island showcasing its unique floral identity, such as Maui's pink lokelani rose and the Big Island's red 'ōhi'a lehua. Giving a lei is a gesture of aloha, and on this day, that warmth can be seen everywhere. Whether crafted from fragrant Plumeria flowers, like the ones pictured here, delicate pikake, or colorful ti leaves, leis symbolize the bonds between people and the land. So, if you find yourself in Hawaii on May 1, don't just say 'Aloha'—wear it.

> It's time to jazz up—literally. From the smoky clubs of New Orleans to the bustling streets of Tokyo, jazz has crossed borders, blended cultures, and turned improvisation into an art form. Every April 30, International Jazz Day—established by UNESCO in 2011—celebrates this genre's role in promoting peace, dialogue, and unity. This music form emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in New Orleans, a city alive with musical traditions from Africa, Europe, and the Caribbean. Rooted in blues and ragtime, jazz quickly evolved, with pioneers like Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald giving it a voice. What started as an American sound soon found a global audience. Swing and bebop took over dance halls, Latin jazz brought a new rhythm, and cool jazz mellowed the mood.
> 
> Today, jazz is everywhere—from Brazilian bossa nova to Ethiopian Ethio-jazz, proving that a good groove knows no borders. This photo of jazz legend John Coltrane and his band performing in London, England, is a perfect example of jazz's worldwide impact. Trends change, technology evolves, and debates continue over what defines jazz, but this music lives on. So, today, tune in, tap your feet, and let the rhythm take over—because this celebration has truly struck the right chord.

> The grass truly is greener on the other side—especially when that side is Château de Villandry. While the Loire Valley in France is packed with stunning châteaux (French for castles), Villandry stands apart, not for its towering turrets or medieval might, but for its gardens. Built in the 16th century by Jean le Breton, a minister to King Francis I, Villandry was always meant to impress. Unlike fortified castles built for war, it was designed for comfort, featuring large windows and an open, welcoming layout. Its gardens are arranged across terraces with distinct themes. The ornamental garden showcases geometric patterns like the one pictured here. The water garden offers a serene retreat, and the vegetable garden turns everyday crops into artistic displays.
> 
> After a challenging period, the dilapidated Château de Villandry was purchased in 1906 by Spanish doctor Joachim Carvallo and his wife, Ann Coleman, an heiress to an American steel empire. Their passion for history and horticulture led to a full restoration, and their descendants continue to maintain the estate today. These gardens change with the seasons, ensuring that no two visits are exactly alike. Whether you have a green thumb or not, it's hard not to admire the precision at play.

> Here's a place where the wild rules and nature moves at its own pace. Moremi Game Reserve stretches across the eastern side of Botswana's Okavango Delta, covering 1,900 square miles. Established in 1963, it became Africa's first reserve created by local people—the Batawana, a Bantu ethnic group native to Southern Africa—to protect the region's wildlife from uncontrolled hunting. The combination of permanent water and dry land makes it one of the best places in Africa to observe wildlife in its natural habitat.
> 
> One animal you're almost certain to spot is the impala. These medium-sized antelopes are active mainly during the day. Males fight fiercely for dominance during the breeding season, or rut, locking horns in dramatic battles. After a six-month gestation period, females give birth to a single fawn. Outside the mating season, they stick together in herds—the territorial males, bachelor herds, and female herds—always on the lookout for predators. When danger strikes, they freeze, only to explode into a sprint when the moment demands. They can leap up to 10 feet high, cover nearly 30 feet in a single bound, and change direction mid-sprint. Whether grazing quietly or launching into a sudden dash, impalas are among Moremi's most adaptable residents.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
