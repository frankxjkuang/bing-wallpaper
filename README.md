<summary>Description</summary>

> Shark Fin Cove, also known as Shark Tooth Beach, is nestled in a cove in the tiny town of Davenport on California's Central Coast. The cove is a coastal gem known for its stunning sea stack—a vertical rock formation that resembles a shark's fin. The fin used to be connected to the mudstone cliff that surrounds the beach. Over time, the relentless crashing waves and strong winds slowly eroded the rock formation. Shark Fin Cove is visible from Highway 1, where travelers can stop and look at the expansive Pacific Ocean views.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Behold Skógafoss, one of Iceland’s largest waterfalls. This powerful cascade measures 82 feet across and drops 200 feet over what were once the sea cliffs of the country’s southern coast. The coastline receded seaward, but the cliffs remained, leaving behind this natural wonder, powered by water from two glaciers. Skógafoss, which translates as 'forest waterfall,' is frequently graced with single or double rainbows, formed by the refraction of sunlight through the mist. Legend has it that a treasure chest is hidden behind Skógafoss, left there by a Viking settler named Prasi Porolfsson.
> 
> The waterfall has appeared on the big screen, in 'Thor: The Dark World' and the Bollywood movie 'Dilwale,' as well as on TV in the final season of 'Game of Thrones.' The Skógar Museum, which offers insights into Iceland's cultural heritage, sits near the waterfall in Skógar village.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This impressive structure is the Amphitheatre of El Jem, in the Tunisian town of the same name. Made entirely from stone blocks, it was built in the 3rd century CE, when this area was Thysdrus, a city of ancient Rome. Once capable of seating up to 35,000 spectators, it is the largest colosseum in North Africa and one of the largest in the world. A UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979, it is one of the best-preserved Roman amphitheatres, almost equal in grandeur to the Colosseum in Rome.
> 
> Beneath the arena, there is an extensive underground network of tunnels and chambers, which are open to visitors. Despite its age, the arena floor is still preserved, and visitors can walk on it, following in the footsteps of gladiators and others who stepped out before huge crowds, nearly 2,000 years ago.

<summary>Description</summary>

> It's Discovery Day in Yukon, Canada, a day to commemorate the 1896 discovery of gold at Bonanza Creek. The event set off the Klondike Gold Rush, which attracted thousands of prospectors to the region in search of gold, leading to significant economic and social changes. The population increase led to Yukon separating from the Northwest Territories and the formation of Yukon Territory in 1898.
> 
> Discovery Day celebrates Yukon's rich heritage, history, and natural resources—like Emerald Lake, seen in today's image, known for its deep green hues. You'll find it on the Klondike Highway, which roughly follows the route used by the prospectors more than a century ago. It is also a day to honor the spirit of adventure exhibited during the gold rush. Government offices, schools, and many businesses close to allow people to participate in the festivities, including parades, historical reenactments, gold panning competitions, and concerts.

<summary>Description</summary>

> To mark International Lighthouse Weekend, we're on England's southwest coast, where Start Point Lighthouse looks out over the turbulent waters of the English Channel. The lighthouse is perched upon a rugged cliff on one of the country's most exposed peninsulas, which stretches nearly a mile into the sea in the county of Devon. Built in 1836, the elegant lighthouse was designed by civil engineer James Walker in the Gothic style, as seen in its castle-like parapet. It has undergone many changes since then and more accommodation was added in the 1870s, but no lighthouse keepers live there now—it has been automated since 1993.

The daguerreotype process became the first publicly available photographic process and was used throughout the 1840s and 1850s.

> Today, August 19 is World Photography Day, promoting the art as a means of storytelling, creative expression, and cultural preservation. The world of photography is vast and captures many subjects and styles on camera, from abstract and fashion photography to landscapes and wildlife, like this cheeky squirrel here. Some seek to keep the charm and artistry of old-fashioned photography alive, though digital cameras and smartphones give everyone the opportunity to capture great photos, sometimes in unexpected places.
