<summary>Description</summary>

> The 'golden hour' just before sunset is the perfect time to take in views of Paris' most ornate bridge, the Pont Alexandre III. Arching over the Seine, the bridge was opened in 1900 and named after a Russian tsar, celebrating a new alliance between the two countries. Befitting the nobility of the event, two 56-foot columns sit on each bank of the river, crowned with gilt-bronze sculptures of the winged horse Pegasus. From the center of the bridge, standing above reliefs decorated with nymphs and beneath Art Nouveau-style lamps, you can admire some famous Parisian monuments. Views include the Esplanade des Invalides, the Grand Palais and Petit Palais museums, and the Eiffel Tower.

> This Eurasian wolf, curled up for a winter nap in the Bavarian Forest National Park, can rest easy knowing it is an apex predator around these parts. This park covers 93 square miles of the wider forest, where it sits on Germany's border with Czechia. The softly rolling mountains Great Rachel, Little Rachel, and Little Arber pose modest challenges for hikers as they wander through stands of Norway spruce. The forest teems with life, including lynxes, bears, pygmy owls, and Eurasian wolves, like our sleepy homepage friend. These wolves form a close-knit pack led by an alpha pair and have been spotted in the park after decades of being hunted out of Western Europe.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Glimmering in aquamarine tones, Lake Louise rests amid the Canadian Rockies in Alberta's Banff National Park. The Indigenous Nakoda people refer to the lake as Ho-run-num-nay, meaning 'lake of the little fishes.' It was later renamed by settlers, inspired by Britain's Princess Louise, whose husband was governor general of Canada between 1878 and 1883. The adjoining hamlet is also called Lake Louise and, at an elevation of almost 5,200 feet, is Canada's highest community.
> 
> This glacial lake is accessible throughout the year via the Trans-Canada Highway, and visitors enjoy hiking in the summer, skiing in the winter, and incredible mountain views at any time of the year.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Martin Luther King Jr. Day serves as a reminder not only of the man, but also of his mission. He stood for advances in civil rights, nonviolent resistance, and a dream of racial harmony. In 1983, the third Monday of January was made a federal holiday to mark his birthday, which was on January 15. It's the only federal holiday that's designated as a national day of service and the 'day on, not a day off' continues to inspire unity, progress, and the ongoing struggle for equality.
> 
> The Stone of Hope statue stands tall at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial, next to the National Mall in Washington, DC. It was created by the sculptor Lei Yixin and Dr. King's words are displayed around the memorial, urging us to continue the journey toward a better, more equitable tomorrow. The statue itself was inspired by a line from Dr. King's 1963 'I Have a Dream' speech: 'With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.'

<summary>Description</summary>

> An elegant creature for a majestic setting. These whooper swans, gliding on the mirror-like surface of Japan's Lake Kussharo, are close relatives of North America's trumpeter swans. Named for their loud call, whooper swans are one of the world's heaviest flying birds, weighing up to around 30 pounds and boasting wingspans of between 7 and 9 feet. Whooper swans are found across Eurasia and are Finland's national bird, spending their breeding season there before migrating to warmer areas for winter. All that travel doesn't ruin their relationships—these waterfowl form strong, monogamous pairs that can last for life.

> Just a few miles north of South Korea's capital city of Seoul, Bukhansan National Park is a retreat for city dwellers and international visitors. Forests and ancient temples sit side-by-side in the park, beneath the three granite peaks of Bukhan Mountain, or Bukhansan. Among the park's ridges and valleys, water deer, wild boar, chipmunks, and squirrels roam freely. A careful ear might pick out the rat-a-tat of woodpeckers or the chirpy melody of songbirds perched in the trees.
