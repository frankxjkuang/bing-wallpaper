> Behold the magic of the Misotsuchi no Tsurara (Misotsuchi Icicles) in Chichibu, Japan. This breathtaking natural ice wall, nearly 100 feet wide and 35 feet tall, is formed by spring water freezing as it trickles down a rock face. The attraction is only open from mid-January through mid-February. Colored lights after dark create a scene that feels straight out of a winter fairy tale.
> 
> Just 2 hours from Tokyo, Chichibu is the perfect escape to enjoy nature's artistry and some fresh mountain air. Warm up after viewing the icicles with a soothing soak at the nearby Otaki Onsen, a popular hot spring, for relaxation. Since much of Chichibu sits in or near the Chichibu Tama Kai National Park, there’s abundant nature to see.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Love is in the air today: it's Valentine's Day! Across the globe, millions of flowers will be sent, and romantic restaurants will be fully booked. This holiday has its origins in the story of Saint Valentine, a 3rd-century Roman priest who, according to legend, secretly married couples to spare the husbands from conscription into the Roman army.
> 
> Just like the human lovebirds who will be celebrating today, the natural world has its own romantics. Today's image features a couple of Magellanic penguins in the Falkland Islands. Magellanic penguins, which are found in coastal Patagonia, mate with the same partner every year. The male returns to the burrow he used the year before and waits for his partner, who can recognize him by his voice alone. Although love should be celebrated every day, today is the perfect day to make an extra effort and show your loved one how much you care.

<summary>Description</summary>

> At Lake Tyrrell, in southern Australia, the sky meets the Earth in a dazzling display. The state of Victoria's largest salt lake was formed around 120,000 years ago. Over time, climate changes caused water levels to drop; these days, the lake is normally dry, except in winter when it's covered in about 2 inches of water. The name 'Tyrrell' comes from the local Wergaia word for 'sky,' a nod to the Boorong Aboriginal People's interest in astronomy. Spanning more than 70 square miles, Lake Tyrrell is a haven for wildlife, including kangaroos, emus, and various reptiles.
> 
> In recent years, the lake has become a tourist hotspot. People come from all over the world during the winter months, drawn by its mirror-like surface that reflects the endless Australian sky, making it the perfect photo op. Salt formations on the lakebed also provide a stunning backdrop for photographs. At night, it becomes the perfect place for stargazing, offering the chance to marvel at the constellations of the Southern Hemisphere.

> Today, we celebrate Darwin Day—a shout-out to Charles Darwin and his game-changing ideas about life on Earth. As an English naturalist, geologist, and biologist, his theory of natural selection revolutionized our understanding of species, evolution, and our role in the natural world. His work, 'On the Origin of Species,' published in 1859, laid the foundation for modern evolutionary biology. This day marks the birthday of Darwin and honors his genius while promoting curiosity, science, and critical thinking.
> 
> Speaking of cool science, marine iguanas, found only on the Galápagos Islands, serve as an example of Darwin's evolutionary principles. These reptiles, seen in today's image, are the only lizards in the world that forage in the sea, diving to graze on algae growing on submerged rocks. They've developed in remarkable ways, acquiring flattened tails for swimming and salt glands that allow them to expel seawater by sneezing. During his visit to the islands in 1835, Darwin noted their appearance as being like 'imps of darkness' but also recognized how perfectly they were adapted to their harsh environment.

> What do 51,000 ancient statues have in common? They all call the Yungang Grottoes in China home! This collection of early Buddhist art is near Datong in Shanxi province, northeastern China. Carved into sandstone cliffs over 1,500 years ago during the Northern Wei dynasty, the grottoes comprise 254 caves. The highlight is the massive Buddha in Cave 5, which is a jaw-dropping 56 feet tall. But don't stop there—each cave offers something unique. Some are like ancient storyboards, depicting tales from Buddhist scriptures, while others showcase detailed carvings of monks, deities, musicians, and even scenes of daily life under Wei rule. These caves blend influences from Indian, Central Asian, and local Chinese Buddhist art. Whether you're a history lover or simply appreciate unique art, the Yungang Grottoes offer an unforgettable experience.

<summary>Description</summary>

> It's National Umbrella Day today, a quirky celebration that honors one of the simplest yet most essential inventions in human history: the umbrella, or parasol. Over 4,000 years ago, in ancient Egypt, Assyria, and China, these foldable canopies were first used to shield people from the sun. It wasn't until the 17th century that the umbrella, as we know it today, gained popularity in Europe, initially as a luxury item primarily for women. Fast-forward a few centuries, and these weather shields have become a staple in pop culture, too. Remember Mary Poppins with her iconic umbrella that helped her fly, or Rihanna's hit song 'Umbrella'?
> 
> Beyond their functionality, umbrellas have also made their mark in art and fashion. They often feature in artistic installations, such as the vibrant display at Borough Market in London, seen in today's image. But have you ever wondered why so many of them are left behind on trains? They're among the most commonly lost items worldwide! Grab yours—rain or shine—and join the celebration.

> If you're chasing sunsets and jaw-dropping views, come to Alstrom Point. Located in southern Utah's Kane County, this spot in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area stands at an impressive height of 4,685 feet. Made mostly of Entrada Sandstone, it has the same geological roots as nearby sites like Romana Mesa, its parent peak, and Gunsight Butte, another sandstone summit to the east.
> 
> Part of the Lake Powell region, Alstrom Point extends southward into the vast waters of the lake, in between Padre Bay and Warm Creek Bay. When the lake is full, Alstrom Point towers nearly 1,000 feet above the water, offering views of the surrounding canyons. Lake Powell, spanning across Utah and Arizona, attracts around 3 million visitors every year. The lake is a maze of deep blue water winding through over 90 rock canyons. While its main stretch runs through Glen Canyon, it also snakes into over many smaller side canyons, along with the Escalante and San Juan Rivers.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
