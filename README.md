> From October 4 to 10, World Space Week invites us to transcend our earthly bounds and chase the stars. It was born from the launch of Sputnik 1 by the USSR in 1957 and the signing of the Outer Space Treaty in 1967, a pioneering international commitment to peaceful cosmic exploration. During this week, classrooms buzz with experiments, planetariums echo with wonder, and telescopes bridge the gap to distant galaxies. Together, these moments weave a universal story of science, discovery, and humanity's relentless drive to push boundaries. The week's mission is clear: to ignite the next generation of explorers, engineers, and dreamers ready to rewrite the cosmos.
> 
> Today's image captures the International Space Station, a vast laboratory built by 15 nations, orbiting about 260 miles above Earth. Its solar arrays soak up sunlight to power groundbreaking research on microgravity, technology, and human survival beyond our planet. Shot from the SpaceX Crew Dragon Endeavour—a reusable spacecraft that has completed six missions since 2020, ferrying astronauts and cargo—this scene embodies what humanity can achieve when it chooses cooperation over competition. Each gleaming panel makes it clear: the final frontier is within reach, and the audacity to explore it defines us.

> Mists curl, waters glimmer, and legends linger—welcome to Glen Brittle. On the Isle of Skye, Scotland's fabled 'Misty Isle,' the glen stretches in a sweep of purple heather carpeting its rugged slopes. The landscape hums with echoes of the past: dinosaurs left footprints on these cliffs long before Mesolithic hunters traced its streams over 8,000 years ago. In the 9th century, seafaring Norse Vikings settled here. Centuries later, the powerful MacLeod and MacDonald clans claimed these lands, their castles standing guard over countless battles and alliances.
> 
> Among the hills and hidden lochs, the Fairy Pools shimmer in emerald and turquoise, tumbling over volcanic rock—a place where, according to local tales, fairies once danced under the moonlight. Nearby, Loch Coruisk, the 'Cauldron of Waters,' tucked beneath the jagged Black Cuillin peaks, is said to be haunted by a kelpie, a shape-shifting water spirit. Red deer glide silently through the heather, rabbits vanish along secret trails, and golden eagles wheel above. Glen Brittle is where geology, wildlife, and human history intertwine. Every stone, waterfall, and valley tells a story—step softly and listen closely.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Beyond water, rivers carry life, history, and stories. They are nature's ever-moving contribution to our landscapes, flowing through lands and across time. One such gem is the Snake River, which winds through Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. A particularly stunning spot along this river is Oxbow Bend—featured in today's image—where calm waters reflect the towering Teton Range, and wildlife such as moose and bald eagles thrive. Here, water flows freely, unbound by concrete or commerce, protected by the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, signed on this day in 1968.
> 
> This landmark law is a promise: that some rivers shall run wild forever. It safeguards waters with 'outstandingly remarkable' beauty, ecology, and spirit—rivers that sing of wilderness and whisper of heritage. The Snake River Headwaters, including Oxbow Bend, joined this sacred list in 2009, ensuring its reflections remain undisturbed and its rhythms unbroken.
> 
> At dawn, mist dances over the bend, and the mountains blush with the first light. Visitors pause, hushed by nature's poetry. Thanks to this Act, the river's story flows on—untamed, unspoiled, unforgettable.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This year marks another milestone in the legacy of Yosemite National Park, a sanctuary protected since 1864 and celebrated for its awe-inspiring grandeur and ecological significance. Nestled in the heart of the Sierra Nevada, Yosemite's nearly 1,200 square miles cradle granite giants, cascading waterfalls, and ancient sequoias. Among its lesser-known treasures lies the Clark Range—the rugged, high-elevation spine seen in today's image. It was named after Galen Clark, Yosemite's first guardian and a pioneer of conservation.
> 
> The Clark Range stands as a quiet sentinel to Yosemite's southern wilderness, its peaks etched by glaciers and crowned with alpine meadows. Here, the wind whispers through whitebark pines and the sky opens wide, echoing the spirit of foresight that birthed the park.
> 
> As we honor Yosemite's anniversary, we celebrate not only its grandeur but the enduring vision of those who fought to preserve it. From the valley's granite walls to the Clark Range's serene heights, this national park remains a living poem—written in stone, water, and time.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Amid the lush eucalyptus canopy of Great Otway National Park, koalas reign as sleepy sentinels of Australia's wild soul. Often misnamed 'koala bears,' these marsupials are actually closer to wombats and tend to be instantly recognizable by their stout, tailless bodies, fluffy ears, and velvety black noses.
> 
> Their diet is notoriously selective—koalas feed almost exclusively on certain eucalyptus leaves laced with toxins that most animals can't digest. To survive, they sleep up to 20 hours a day while a specialized, bacteria-rich gut works to neutralize the poison. This slow-motion lifestyle is nature's masterstroke of adaptation.
> 
> Yet their future hangs in the balance. From habitat loss, disease, and climate-driven threats like bushfires, koalas are at a critical crossroads. But forest restoration, dedicated sanctuaries, and Indigenous-led conservation are beginning to turn the tide. With continued care, these gentle climbers can cling to the treetops (and to our hearts) as enduring symbols of Australia's wild spirit for generations to come.

<summary>Description</summary>

> You won't find souvenir shops or tourist maps pointing the way—but follow the edge of Lake Rietplas in Houten, and you'll stumble upon one of the Netherlands' most unexpectedly photogenic sights. While many flock to Amsterdam's canals or Rotterdam's cube houses, this quiet commuter town offers its own architectural twist. Lined up like a mirage, the Rainbow Houses shimmer in bold, painterly hues—a residential block turned an understated cultural landmark.
> 
> To locals, they're simply part of the daily backdrop. But for photographers and design lovers, they're a dreamscape of saturation and symmetry. Designed by Hans Been and completed in 2005, the ensemble blends Caribbean flair with Nordic restraint, echoing the look of a minimalist fishing village. Each house reflects a different color of the spectrum. This isn't a curated tourist stop; these are lived-in homes, part of a neighborhood shaped by the same thoughtful planning that makes Houten one of the most bike-friendly towns in the country. Best seen from across the lake or a nearby bridge, these vibrant facades feel like a secret you're lucky to catch in the right light: charming, surprising, and refreshingly under the radar.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Some towns evolve slowly over centuries. Pienza? It received a full rebrand in the 1400s from a pope who wanted to prove a point—and maybe show off a little. This tiny Italian town is perched above the Val d'Orcia, surrounded by rolling hills that look exactly like you think Tuscany should: cypress trees, winding dirt roads, the occasional sheep. It's peaceful. And then you step inside the town walls, and it gets clever.
> 
> Pienza was once a regular medieval village called Corsignano. That is, until one of its sons became Pope Pius II and decided to transform his hometown. He hired architect Bernardo Rossellino and rebuilt the area based on Renaissance ideals of symmetry, order, and harmony. The result? A site that feels intentional. The central square, Piazza Pio II, is flanked by a cathedral, a papal palace, and a town hall, all arranged just so. Moreover, Pienza is known for pecorino cheese—sheep's milk, aged in interesting ways. And once a year, the whole town turns into a cheese arena for Fiera del Cacio, a festival featuring Cacio al Fuso—a game where people roll wheels of cheese at a target.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
