<summary>Description</summary>

> This International Museum Day, let's immerse ourselves in Raoul Dufy's 6,460 square-foot fresco. The 'La Fée Electricité' (The Spirit of Electricity) is housed at the Museum of Modern Art in Paris. This stunning artwork was created for the Pavilion of Light and Electricity at the 1937 International Exhibition of Art and Technology in Modern Life. The painting was inspired by the poem 'On the Nature of Things,' written by Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius. Raoul Dufy's work vividly depicts the evolution of electricity through two main themes: the history of electricity and its applications.
> 
> International Museum Day, celebrated annually on May 18, aims to raise awareness about the importance of museums in cultural exchange, enrichment, and mutual understanding. Since its inception in 1977, the event has grown to include over 37,000 museums across 158 countries. This year's theme, 'The Future of Museums in Rapidly Changing Communities,' invites us to reimagine the role of museums as essential connectors and drivers of innovation.

> Pictured here is a spectacular view of a delta in the Venetian Lagoon, Italy. Spanning over 212 square miles, this lagoon is a rich mosaic of islands, mudflats, canals, and marshes, and it's one of the largest wetlands in the entire Mediterranean Basin. The lagoon isn't just a scenic wonder—it's a place steeped in history and innovation. Formed after the last Ice Age, it became a refuge for people fleeing invasions around the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476. In the centuries that followed, those early settlers began building what would eventually become the iconic city of Venice.
> 
> Today, the lagoon is still central to local life, supporting fishing, tourism, and even sustainable aquaculture. It's connected to the Adriatic Sea by three inlets and is famous for acqua alta, or 'high water,' when tides flood parts of Venice. From ancient refuge to modern marvel, the Venetian Lagoon is a reflection of how people and nature can shape a place together.

> Each year on the third Friday of May, people worldwide recognize Endangered Species Day—a day to celebrate, learn about, and act on behalf of at-risk wildlife. First launched in 2006 by the Endangered Species Coalition and conservationist David Robinson, this event inspires local and global efforts to protect threatened animals and their habitats.
> 
> The stunning bird featured in today's image is a great green macaw. Native to the tropical forests of Central and South America, this colorful parrot is critically endangered, with fewer than 1,000 individuals estimated to remain in the wild. These intelligent, social birds depend heavily on old-growth forests, particularly in places like Costa Rica, where they nest in almendro trees. Deforestation and habitat fragmentation remain their greatest threats. On May 16, let's join wildlife refuges, schools, and conservation groups in celebrating and supporting biodiversity. Every voice counts in protecting species that still have a fighting chance.

> London's most famous clock tower isn't called Big Ben—that name belongs to the massive 13.5-ton bell inside. The Great Clock has marked time for Londoners since 1859, ringing from what is now known as the Elizabeth Tower. In 2012, officials renamed the Clock Tower as Elizabeth Tower to honor Queen Elizabeth II during her Diamond Jubilee. At 316 feet tall, the tower is part of the grand Palace of Westminster. The clock has stopped only for maintenance and rare disruptions, such as bomb damage during each world war. Each of its four clock faces spans 22.5 feet, with the minute hands measuring 14 feet.
> 
> For centuries, the Palace of Westminster has stood at the heart of British politics. Originally built by Edward the Confessor in the 11th century, the palace has hosted Parliament since the 13th century. Previously a royal residence, it remained one until a fire in 1512 forced Henry VIII to relocate. A second devastating fire in 1834 destroyed most of the medieval complex, leading to the Gothic Revival design seen today. Architect Charles Barry led the reconstruction, while his assistant, Augustus Pugin, designed the intricate details. Covering about 27.8 acres, the palace houses the House of Commons, the House of Lords, and Westminster Hall, which dates back to 1097.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Most ports rely on docks and cranes that extend into the shoreline. Porto Flavia on the Italian island of Sardinia took a completely different approach. This engineering marvel transformed a cliff into a gateway for Sardinia's ore industry. Mining in the area has a history dating back thousands of years, from the Phoenicians and Romans to the industrial boom in the 20th century. Lead, zinc, coal, sulfur, barium, and silver were extracted from these rugged hills, but transporting them was a logistical nightmare. Ore had to be hauled by cart, loaded onto small boats, and then transferred to larger ships—a slow, costly, and inefficient process.
> 
> In 1924, Italian engineer Cesare Vecelli revolutionized ore transport in the region. He designed Porto Flavia as a system of tunnels and silos carved into a limestone cliff, allowing ore to be loaded directly onto cargo ships. The facility featured two stacked tunnel levels. The upper level could store up to 11,000 short tons of ore in nine reservoirs. Gravity-fed chutes transported the ore to the lower level, where a conveyor belt loaded it directly onto waiting ships. The port, named after Vecelli's daughter, Flavia, remained in use until mining declined in the mid-20th century. Today, visitors can explore its tunnels, massive silos, and the platform where ships once docked—soaking in the same sea breeze that once carried Sardinia's minerals to markets worldwide.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Wildlife roams freely in one of Chile's most stunning protected areas, where towering peaks and ancient glaciers shape the land. Established on this day in 1959, Torres del Paine National Park in Patagonia turns 66 years old today and covers over 448,000 acres. Originally called Grey Lake National Tourism Park, it was renamed in 1970 and later designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1978. Its most recognizable feature—the three massive granite peaks known as the Torres—stands over 8,000 feet tall. These formations took shape through magma intrusion and uplift, followed by millions of years of glacial erosion, leaving behind the jagged spires seen today.
> 
> The park's lakes and rivers, fueled by melting ice, create a hydrological network that sustains its wildlife. Four major glaciers—Tyndall, Grey, Dickson, and Zapata—are fed by the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. Originating from Dickson Lake, the Paine River flows through various bodies of water, including Paine Lake, Nordenskjöld Lake, and Pehoé Lake. Wildlife thrives here, including pumas, endangered southern huemuls (south Andean deer), Chilean flamingos, and chimango caracaras. With grasslands, wetlands, and forests, the park supports a range of plant life, including lenga and Antarctic beech, and cushion plants that endure the harsh climate.

> Flower viewing is a beloved tradition in Japan, with each season bringing its own natural spectacle. Just as the last sakura (cherry blossom) petals drift away, Tokyo's gardens start gearing up for their next big show: the iris bloom. Featured here is an iris garden in Tokyo. The iris is a flowering plant genus that has 310 recognized species, known for their bold and beautiful blossoms. The genus is named after the Greek word 'îris', meaning 'rainbow,' which is also the name of the Greek goddess of rainbows.
> 
> During the Edo Period (1603-1867), a fascination with breeding Japanese irises led to an explosion of new varieties. Today, there are over 2,000 types, which are planted in March and nurtured by tsuyu, Japan's rainy season. These vibrant flowers make their grand entrance in early June, marking the start of summer. Three beautiful iris species flourish in the country's gardens and wild landscapes: hanashōbu (Iris ensata), kakitsubata (Iris laevigata), and ayame (Iris sanguinea). Iris ensata is known as 'Japanese iris' outside Japan. With flowers this stunning, who wouldn't want to take a stroll through this floral paradise?

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
