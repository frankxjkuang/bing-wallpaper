<summary>Description</summary>

> Today, we're floating across the waves, following the ocean currents to Japan. Marine Day—海の日, Umi no Hi in Japanese—is celebrated on the third Monday in July. Japan has 14,125 islands and has over 18,400 miles of coastline, so it's no wonder the sea plays such a key role in its culture. It provides much of the country's food and is vital for trading and communicating with other nations.
> 
> One Marine Day tradition is to give thanks by throwing mud balls into the water; these balls are packed with microorganisms that help to purify the sea. Today's image takes us to Tateishi Park on Japan's largest island, Honshu. This scenic spot has stunning views of Sagami Bay and Mount Fuji, making it the perfect place to celebrate Japan's coastal waters.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Surrounded by rugged, dark landscapes, La Geria is a marvel of viticulture. Most of the Spanish island of Lanzarote is treeless and covered with black-gray soil. This thick blanket of volcanic gravel is the result of a series of eruptions in the 1700s. By 1775, farmers started growing crops in the new layer of nutrient-rich soil. Volcanic soil absorbs and retains moisture, and the ash keeps its temperature favorable for growing grapes. The holes surrounded by stones you see in our image were dug to protect young grape plants from strong winds. La Geria's innovative approach to cultivation in an arid climate has been rewarded with its abundance of fine wine, fermented from Malvasia grapes.

> Are you ready to make some noise? Wait, not that sort of rock. Today, we're all about granite, limestone, and slate. There are three types of rock: igneous rocks formed from magma and lava; sedimentary rocks made from a mixture of particles like sand and mud; and metamorphic rocks that are the result of heat and pressure on other kinds of rock.
> 
> Today's image takes us to the 'fairy chimneys' of Cappadocia in central Türkiye. These cone-shaped pillars are made of tuff, a sedimentary rock formed from volcanic ash and debris. In the sides of the rocks, ancient residents carved homes and churches. The area is also famous for its underground cities, which were cut out of the tuff to provide shelter and safety. This is just one of the many uses for rocks that humans have come up with throughout history.

> In the shadow of Mount Rainier, a carpet of wildflowers bursts into life. Every summer, the meadows around this mountain are colored with vivid shades of blooming subalpine flowers: purple asters, pink coralroot, and yellow tiger lilies, and more. Also known as Tahoma, at over 14,400 feet, Mount Rainier is the tallest mountain in the state of Washington. It is covered by 36 square miles of glaciers and permanent snowfields, the highest glacier ice cover of any mountain in the lower 48 states.
> 
> Mount Rainier National Park encompasses mountains, waterfalls, meadows, and old-growth forests and teems with life, from cougars and beavers to bald eagles and peregrine falcons. It is also a popular climbing destination, with some 10,000 people attempting to scale the mountain every year while others enjoy hiking along its trails. It's never sunnier in Rainier than in July and August, making summer the perfect time to visit.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In 1987, sometime around July 11, the world population reached the 5-billion mark. The United Nations recognized the need to address issues like family planning, infrastructure, waste, and pollution and established World Population Day in 1989. It is estimated that we hit 8 billion people in November 2022 and the UN expects the world to reach 9.7 billion people in 2050. But not everywhere faces the same challenges. While some areas struggle with overcrowding, others grapple with decreasing populations. The Italian town of Gangi, Sicily, seen in today's image, had about 16,000 residents in the 1950s. Today, it is home to little more than 6,000. Keen on revitalization, Gangi attracts new residents by giving away abandoned houses, on the condition that the properties are then restored.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Black and yellow plumage, bright eyes, and an oversized bill—meet the collared aracari, a fascinating tropical bird. Gracing the forests from Mexico through Costa Rica, where today's image was taken, to Colombia and Venezuela, this toucan gets its name from the red marking on the back of the neck. These birds circle through the air in groups of up to 15, and at night, snuggle together in tree cavities. Their song is as unique as their look—a high squeaky note that sounds like 'seek,' sometimes a 'purr' or even a raspy 'grhhrr.' Although deforestation and hunting pose threats to these birds, they are not endangered. For now, collared aracaris remain a captivating sight, a splash of color, and a burst of life amid the sprawling branches.

> As Argentina celebrates Independence Day, Talampaya National Park invites us to venture into the country's ancient heart. Here, towering red rock formations reach skyward, and cliffs and caves feature petroglyphs created by the Ciénaga, Diaguita, and other Indigenous cultures more than 1,000 years ago. This 830-square-mile park in La Rioja province is also home to some of the oldest dinosaur remains ever found. Moreover, nature's beauty is shown in the local flora, like xeric shrubs and cactus, and fauna. Guanacos, hares, and foxes roam free, while condors, white-throated cacholotes, and sandy gallitos grace the skies above this UNESCO World Heritage Site.
