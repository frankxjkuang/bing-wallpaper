<summary>Description</summary>

> Walk into any large square in Naples, Italy, and the city's history comes into focus. Arched galleries, sweeping colonnades, and domes that echo ancient architecture compete for your attention. Every street shifts in style—compact Baroque facades give way to broad Neoclassical courtyards. Continue exploring, and you will arrive at a wide square with a building that appears Roman at first sight. That's the Basilica of San Francesco di Paola, located on the west side of Piazza del Plebiscito.
> 
> Completed in 1846, the basilica took shape after Ferdinand I, King of the Two Sicilies, returned to power and continued the construction begun under King Joachim Murat of Naples. The design followed strict Neoclassical principles: a circular body, a triangular pediment, and a dome modeled after the Pantheon—a famous second-century Roman temple.
> 
> Inside, the geometry continues with polished marble, broad arches, and chapels spaced along the circular walkway. The piazza features a curving colonnade that borders the basilica and frames its dome. Planning a trip to Naples? Piazza del Plebiscito awaits you.

<summary>Description</summary>

> If you've ever watched a wildlife documentary, you know the moment: the camera pans across a quiet savanna, and suddenly a leopard appears as if it has been there all along. That quiet reveal says everything about how these cats operate. They move with precision, slipping through grass and branches without making a sound. Their build, muscular but lean, helps them climb, sprint, and hide in plain sight. Their rosetted coats? No two patterns match, each serving as natural camouflage from sunrise to moonlight.
> 
> These skilled swimmers follow no strict diet. They prey on antelopes when available, switch to hares or birds when needed, and sometimes hunt at waterholes where other animals gather. When leopards secure a kill, they often cache it safely in a tree or a cave, using their strong forelimbs to keep it away from lions and hyenas.
> 
> Leopards range across sub-Saharan Africa, India, Sri Lanka, and small regions of Central and West Asia. Today's image was taken in Etosha National Park, in north-central Namibia, a haven for Africa's iconic wildlife. Established in 1907, the park is home to elephants, lions, cheetahs, black rhinos, wildebeests, zebras, and steenboks—and gives leopards space to hunt and room to roam.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Tucked deep within Norway's Arctic Circle, Reine feels like the kind of place you see on a postcard and assume can't possibly be real. But it is. This small fishing village of about 300 residents is known for its steep mountains, calm fjords, and bright red rorbuer—traditional fishermen's cabins—that dot the shoreline. Despite its size, Reine draws thousands of visitors each year.
> 
> For most of its history, Reine has been a working village. It served as a trading post in the 1700s, and fishing has always been the backbone of daily life. Even during World War II, when parts of the village were burned by German forces, locals rebuilt and carried on. Today, people come for all kinds of experiences. Some climb Reinebringen for its sweeping views; others wander the shoreline or try a plate of fish that was probably caught that morning. Staying in a restored cabin offers a glimpse of what life here looked like before tourism arrived. What makes Reine memorable isn't a list of 'must-do' activities; it's the history, tradition, and sense of community that settle in the moment you arrive.

<summary>Description</summary>

> National Take the Stairs Day, observed on the second Wednesday of January, encourages everyone to add small bursts of movement to daily life. Choosing stairs instead of elevators, or fitting in a short walk or bike ride, helps build healthier habits. With millions living with chronic lung disease and air quality concerns growing, simple actions that strengthen our bodies matter more than ever.
> 
> If you want to mark the day with a climb to remember, the Fortress of Palamidi has you covered. Rising 709 feet above the city of Nafplio in Greece, this Venetian-built stronghold dates back to 1714. This impressive fortification has eight bastions, each designed as an independent unit so that if one fell, the others could still be defended. The Ottomans captured the fortress a year after completion, and Greece reclaimed it in 1822, renaming the bastions after heroes like Achilles and Leonidas. Today, visitors often test themselves on the fortress's famous staircase—once believed to have 999 steps, though the actual count is 857. At the top, sweeping views of the Argolic Gulf make every step worthwhile.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Most people wrap up their New Year plans by the first week of January. Wales, however, has a charming habit of saying, 'Hold on—we've got one more celebration left.' Enter Hen Galan, the 'Old New Year,' observed on January 13 in parts of Wales, most famously in the Gwaun Valley. The date survives from the old Julian calendar, kept long after the rest of Britain adopted the Gregorian one.
> 
> Alongside Hen Galan is Calennig, a tradition rooted in the Welsh word for 'New Year's gift.' Children lead the festivities with decorated apples—fruit studded with cloves, topped with holly, and balanced on three wooden legs. They carry the apples from house to house, reciting cheerful rhymes in exchange for coins or treats. In the past, kids would also carry jugs of water to splash on people's hands and faces or sprinkle around the house for luck.
> 
> Today, Calennig is less widespread than it once was, but the practice hasn't vanished. Schools still teach the old verses for Hen Galan, and local groups keep the customs alive. And if you ever want to see a place with apple-growing heritage, visit the Vale of Clwyd, featured in today's image.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The clue isn't the tracks in the snow—it's the frosted faces peeking out like they've just discovered winter. Estonia is one of Europe's best places to spot Eurasian otters, thanks to its clean rivers, wide wetlands, and snack-filled coastline. This protected species was named Estonia's Animal of the Year in 2024. While globally considered near threatened, their population here has grown substantially, reaching an estimated 2,000 in recent years, up from a historic low of just 300 before the turn of the millennium.
> 
> From Soomaa National Park's flooded forests to Matsalu National Park's calm shallows, these mammals—with their streamlined bodies, webbed feet, and long tails—weave through the country's waters with ease. Their thick fur traps warm air, allowing them to dive into cold Baltic currents without hesitation. While they look cute, their hunting skills are sharp: they track fish, frogs, and crustaceans with precision.
> 
> Unlike their sea otter cousins, Eurasian otters tend to work solo, but in Estonia's wetlands, neighbors aren't far away. They communicate with whistles, chirps, and occasional snorts. When pups arrive, the banks become playful classrooms where young otters learn to swim, eat, and master the 'oops, did I splash you?' face.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> On January 11, 1944, Morocco took a bold step toward freedom. Sixty-six leaders signed the Proclamation of Independence, demanding an end to French and Spanish colonial rule and affirming the country's right to sovereignty. This manifesto, backed by Sultan Mohammed V, was presented not only to colonial authorities but also to representatives of the US, UK, and the former Soviet Union—a signal that Morocco's struggle was part of a global call for self-determination. Though repression followed, the movement endured, and by 1956 Morocco achieved full independence, marking a turning point in North African history.
> 
> Today, that spirit of resilience echoes in Chefchaouen, the 'Blue Pearl' of the Rif Mountains. Founded in the 15th century as a fortress against Portuguese incursions, the city later adopted its signature blue palette—a tradition some trace to Jewish influence and others to Andalusian roots. Wandering through its serene alleys, where indigo walls meet crisp mountain air, feels like stepping into a living canvas—a reminder that Morocco's story is painted in courage, culture, and color.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
