> The world's slowest mammal takes the spotlight today on International Sloth Day. Celebrated on October 20, it highlights their lives, conservation efforts, and the threats they face, including shrinking habitats. There are six living sloth species, divided into two types: three-toed sloths and two-toed sloths.
> 
> Today's image features the laid-back, tree-loving, three-toed sloth, found in the tropical regions of South and Central America. With three clawed toes on each limb, they cling onto branches with ease. Sloths are mainly leaf eaters, and to help them break down tough, fibrous leaves, they have a special multi-chambered stomach. With their super slow metabolism, digestion takes its sweet time, and they don't need much food each day to get by. They're so slow-moving that algae often develop on their fur, giving a greenish tint that provides them camouflage.

> Today, dig deep and unearth your inner Indiana Jones or Lara Croft on International Archaeology Day. The event celebrates archaeology's benefits for society, and includes exhibits and hands-on excavations, some of which run throughout the month. Many US national and state parks, historic landmarks, and local museums also hold events.
> 
> Egypt is steeped in ancient history and home to many internationally renowned archaeological sites, including the Temple of Hathor, the ceiling of which can be seen in today's image. Part of the Dendera Temple Complex in Qena, Hathor is one of the best-preserved ancient Egyptian temples. While the current temple dates to Ptolemy XII and Cleopatra VII (around 50 BCE), evidence suggests that previous temples dedicated to Hathor, an Egyptian goddess of love and fertility, go back thousands of years earlier.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Every autumn, many of the 18,000 trees in Central Park, New York, are painted in shades of yellow, red, and orange. It's one of Central Park's most photographed seasons, and fall in the park has provided iconic backdrops for movies like 'When Harry Met Sally…' and 'Hair.' Trees sense the coming of winter not only by temperature, but by the angle at which sunlight hits their leaves. Because of New York's buildings, the unique interaction of light, shadows, and temperatures often results in fall foliage occurring later in the park than the rest of the city.
> 
> Today's image features fall in the Mall, a pedestrian walkway designed and built in the mid-1800s. Flanked by benches and American elm trees, the Mall's canopy was meant to evoke an architectural space like a cathedral. The quarter-mile promenade is the park's only straight path, and it was intended to be a place for New Yorkers of all classes and backgrounds to gather, stroll, sit, and perhaps ponder the passing seasons.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Mars, the fourth planet from the sun, is often referred to as the 'Red Planet' due to its rusty hue from the iron oxide-rich soil dust. The planet is dotted with frosty dunes, largely located in the high latitudes of the northern plains. Mars' atmosphere is composed of nearly 96% carbon dioxide, which is why carbon ice forms on the surface. These dunes showcase the dynamic interaction between Mars' thin atmosphere, its surface, and seasonal temperature changes.
> 
> As the Martian seasons change, the frost layer transforms directly from solid to gas as temperatures rise. The dunes then gradually lose their frosty appearance, and the cycle repeats with each cold season. Data collected from spacecraft and orbiters, like NASA's Phoenix spacecraft and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, has helped us to better understand these intriguing frost-covered formations.

> If you're a fan of dinosaurs, trilobites, or fossilized shells, then National Fossil Day is the perfect excuse to get your hands dirty. Celebrated on the second Wednesday of October, this day is dedicated to promoting the scientific and educational value of fossils. From towering T. rexes to tiny ammonites, these ancient remains help scientists piece together the puzzle of our planet's history.
> 
> Let's visit the Jurassic Coast, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Dorset, England, pictured here today. It's like a giant natural history museum, with rocks and cliffs that reveal 185 million years of Earth's history. But what really steals the show are the fossils, especially those of belemnites and ammonites—extinct marine creatures—that are pictured here. Mary Anning, a pioneering fossil hunter who combed these shores two centuries ago, paved the way for our current understanding of fossils. Now, it's your turn. Embrace National Fossil Day by embarking on your own journey through time.

<summary>Description</summary>

> They say the grass is always greener on the other side, and no one takes that more literally than the wildebeests of the Serengeti in Tanzania. Every July, roughly 2 million of these determined grazers, along with zebras and other herbivores, set off on a journey north to the Masai Mara in Kenya in search of lush pastures and fresh water. The great migration, considered one of the seven wonders of the natural world, is a safari spectacle where survival is the prize.
> 
> One of the most dramatic moments of the migration is the crossing of the Mara River at the border between Tanzania and Kenya. Thousands of wildebeests gather at the riverbank, aware that danger lurks beneath the surface—the crocodiles—not to mention the lions and leopards that patrol the banks. When the first wildebeest takes the plunge, it's a wild rush as the rest of the herd follows, creating a chaotic scene. Some make it across, while others become part of the food chain. As October rolls around and the rains return to the Serengeti, the herds begin their journey back south, completing the cycle once again.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The second Monday of October is used by many to celebrate Indigenous Peoples' Day, as an alternative to Columbus Day, held on the same date. It highlights the customs and heritage of the Indigenous Peoples who lived in North America before the arrival of European settlers, and the devastating impact colonization had upon them.
> 
> Today's image takes us to one of the places that Indigenous Peoples' legacy can still be seen. In the rocks of the Grand Canyon, the Nankoweap Granaries were carved by the Ancestral Pueblo culture around 1100 CE. Used to keep the crops that were grown safe from the elements, these granaries could be fully sealed when needed. The Ancestral Pueblo people lived in the Four Corners region, building houses and other structures out of stone and adobe, or carving them into canyon walls.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
