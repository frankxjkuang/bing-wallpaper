> Happy New Year's Day! Humans have celebrated the new year since at least 2000 BCE, but various cultures have chosen different days coinciding with equinoxes or lunar cycles. The Romans established January 1 as the beginning of the year in 153 BCE, but this fell out of favor throughout Europe during the medieval era. Since 1582 and the widespread adoption of the Gregorian calendar, however, much of the world now celebrates the new year today. In addition to watching fireworks, drinking champagne, and making resolutions in the wee hours of the morning, other global traditions include making noise, eating lucky foods, and giving gifts.
> 
> If you're wondering what polar bears like the ones in today's image have to do with the new year, the answer is simple: polar bear plunges. Countries around the world hold winter events where participants enter frigid, often icy bodies of water, and communities in the US, Canada, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom do this on New Year's Day. Whether doing so as an enthusiast, to raise money for charity, or as part of a new year's tradition, keep a warm towel handy if you plan to take the plunge.

> New Year's Eve, also known as Old Year's Day, is celebrated around the world with revelry, fireworks, and for some, religious and cultural observances. Many countries celebrate with foods symbolic of prosperity, long life, and good fortune for the coming year, and many people sing the Scottish folk song 'Auld Lang Syne' at the stroke of midnight in remembrance of old friends and past experiences. The new year is often personified as a baby in a tradition that dates back to ancient Greeks, and paired with an old man who represents the year that is ending.
> 
> Get-togethers are a common way to ring in the new year, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, throws a memorable one. Rio is known for many things, including colorful, exuberant celebrations, glorious beaches, and the free New Year's Eve party at Copacabana Beach, seen in today's image. Known as Réveillon to locals, this New Year's Eve soiree is the largest in the world, with millions of revelers.

<summary>Description</summary>

> At the heart of Tasmania, an island state off the southeastern coast of Australia, lies Mount Field National Park. Covering more than 60 square miles, it's one of the state's oldest national parks. As you follow the winding road up through the park, you'll see a whole range of landscapes, from temperate rainforests full of some of the world's tallest eucalyptus trees to alpine moorland. These ever-changing views are what give the park its nickname, 'the park for all seasons.' One of the park's must-visit sites is Russell Falls, a three-tiered waterfall that plunges 190 feet.
> 
> Today's image, taken in the park, features two plants found nowhere on Earth but Tasmania: pandani—also known as the giant grass tree—and Tasmanian snow gum. Pandani is the tallest member of the heather family and can grow almost 40 feet tall, while Tasmanian snow gum is a type of eucalyptus tree that thrives in the central plateau of Tasmania. Along with its impressive flora, the park is also home to amazing fauna: Tasmanian devils, wombats, and platypuses can all be spotted here. In spring, summer, fall, and winter, this park is guaranteed to amaze.

> Imagine a colossal puzzle made from over 2 million stone blocks—that's Borobudur, seen in today's image. Built during the 9th century in the reign of the Shailendra dynasty—an influential ruling family in Southeast Asia—it's the world's largest Buddhist temple, standing tall on the island of Java, Indonesia. This ancient sanctum has withstood centuries of natural challenges, including volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, thanks to its advanced interlocking stone system. Historically, Borobudur was an important pilgrimage site. After being abandoned for centuries, it was rediscovered in the 19th century by the English lieutenant governor Thomas Stamford Raffles.
> 
> Here, each step is an architectural marvel, combining Gupta, Buddhist, and Javanese styles. The structure is divided into three sections: the base has detailed carvings that teach moral lessons; the middle level consists of five square terraces with reliefs depicting daily life and historical events; and the upper levels are three circular platforms with 72 stupas—mound-like structures containing Buddha statues. Oh, and those bell-shaped stupas on the top? Inside each one, a serene Buddha waits, watching as visitors soak in the surroundings.

> Today is a big day for conservation—it's the anniversary of the Endangered Species Act. Passed in the US in 1973, this law was a game-changer, ensuring that economic growth wouldn't steamroll over species at risk of disappearing forever. For the first time, plants were given protection too, and the focus shifted from merely avoiding extinction to actively helping species recover to the point where they could thrive without protection.
> 
> Today's image shows an endangered green sea turtle swimming in the waters off New Caledonia in the southwest Pacific Ocean. Found along the coastlines of over 140 countries, they nest in more than 80 countries year round. In the US, they can be found on both coasts, from Texas to Maine, and from California all the way up to southern Alaska. Despite their size and strength, they face significant challenges, including hunting, boat collisions, and entanglement in fishing nets. In the image, the turtle is gliding over staghorn coral, a threatened species of marine invertebrates. This coral can grow to over 6 feet and is crucial to marine ecosystems. Thanks to its rapid growth, it acts as a marine nursery for juvenile fish, as well as providing buffer zones against erosion and storms. Let's take a moment to appreciate the progress we've made in protecting our planet's most vulnerable species—and remember that the work is far from over.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Lake Bled in Slovenia gets plenty of attention in summer, but winter? That's when things slow down in the best way. The lake's emerald waters take on a softer tone, and Bled Island, with its quaint church, looks straight out of a winter fairytale, as seen in today's image. The 1.3-mile lake, surrounded by the snow-dusted Julian Alps, was formed over 14,000 years ago through glacial and tectonic activity. The first signs of settlement on Bled Island date back to the New Stone Age (10,000 BCE to 3,000 BCE). Additionally, archaeologists uncovered an Early Medieval graveyard here from the 9th century CE. Today, it houses the Church of the Assumption—built in its current form near the end of the 17th century—where visitors ring the 'wishing bell' for good luck.
> 
> When you're here, don't let the cold keep you indoors. Take a walk around the lake, ride the traditional boat, called a pletna, to Bled Island, or head up to Bled Castle for sweeping views of the town. Feeling adventurous? There are plenty of ski slopes not far from the lake. And before you go, treat yourself to a slice of Bled cream cake—yes, it's famous for a reason, and no, you won't regret it.

<summary>Description</summary>

> As the last notes of Christmas carols linger in the air, Boxing Day arrives. This day is celebrated in the United Kingdom, Canada, and several Commonwealth countries. In the past, it was customary for the wealthy to give boxes filled with gifts to their servants on the day after Christmas. The tradition evolved into a day for charitable giving to the less fortunate. Today, while the spirit of giving remains, it has transformed into a holiday about enjoying bustling sales and a lineup of soccer matches.
> 
> Let's visit the harbor of Mousehole, a fishing village in Cornwall, England, to keep the merriment going. Featured in today's image, Mousehole harbor is known for its Christmas illuminations. The Mousehole lights were first lit in the early 1960s, thanks to local artist Joan Gillchrest. A few humble strings of lights soon turned into a full-blown spectacle, growing over the years to include iconic scenes, nautical motifs, and Cornish themes. Today, the lights, switched on from December until early January, span the entire harbor, wrapping buildings, boats, and even the water's edge in a soft glow.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
