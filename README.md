> The Moselle River, a tributary of the powerful Rhine, meanders through the landscapes of France, Luxembourg, and Germany. Along the way, it carves out valleys of breathtaking natural beauty, dotted with towns and historic landmarks. Lush, sun-drenched vineyards cling to the steep slopes overlooking the river, producing some of the finest wines in the world, including riesling, pinot blanc, and pinot gris, to name a few. The river's gentle flow and sparkling waters invite visitors to embark on leisurely cruises or peaceful walks along its shores. The Moselle creates a haven for nature lovers, wine enthusiasts, and history buffs alike.

> Happy World Chocolate Day! Hidden inside these colorful pods are cocoa seeds, or beans, which will be fermented, roasted, and ground on their way to being turned into chocolate, a sweet treat with a worldwide fanbase.
> 
> Chocolate has a fascinating history. Its origins can be traced back to the Indigenous Olmec people of Mesoamerica, who dried and fermented the seeds of the cacao tree to create an unsweetened alcoholic beverage. The solid chocolate bars we love today came much later, in the 19th century, when J.S. Fry and Sons put them into production. The company created its first solid bar in 1847, closely followed in 1849 by rival firm Cadbury. Things snowballed from there and today, we are spoiled for choice. So, whether you prefer the creamy sweetness of milk chocolate, or the bitterness of super dark chocolate, today is the perfect time to indulge yourself in this delicious confection.

> This photograph captures a heartwarming moment between two southern rockhopper penguins, the perfect image for International Kissing Day. Why do we kiss? Well, dozens of cultures don't kiss on the lips at all. For those that do, theories range widely, from the chemical reactions in the brain, to ancient ancestral parents chewing food for their children, to simply smelling each other. Of course, no scientific explanation can capture the magic of a shared kiss. Perhaps that's why artists including Prince, Faith Hill, and Hall & Oates have all had chart-toppers about lip-locking; they have found a way to put an indescribable feeling into words.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Porto Timoni beach, in Corfu, Greece, is a hidden gem reached either by boat, or by hiking from the historic village of Afionas. Those who make the journey are rewarded with two stunning coves, offering a unique double-beach experience. With clear turquoise waters and dramatic cliffs, Porto Timoni presents a picturesque coastal panorama. Surrounding the beach, lush olive groves and cypress trees add to its charm. Greek islands like Corfu may seem timeless and ancient but they are relatively new in the history of Earth. A leading theory is that around 5.3 million years ago, a great flood poured in between Africa and Europe from the Atlantic Ocean, an event called the Zanclean flood. Lakes became oceans and what were previously mountaintops became islands.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Break out the BBQ and unfurl your flags, Independence Day is here! Founding Father John Adams wrote to his wife, Abigail, that he believed the holiday would be celebrated with parades, sports, shows, and illuminations. After 247 years, Americans are keeping those traditions alive, though not on the date that Adams anticipated. The Second Continental Congress voted to approve the independence of the United States of America on July 2, 1776, but formally adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4. That date, enshrined on the Declaration document, became the one we observe today. If you're looking for a grand way to celebrate, journey to New York City for views of their annual fireworks show and the Empire State Building lit up to match in red, white, and blue.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Is it hot enough for you? Chances are it is, as we get into what are typically the hottest months of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, thanks to the tilt of the Earth angling more towards the sun in summer. You may have heard this sweltering period called the dog days of summer, though that name doesn't come from hot dogs or panting pooches. Rather it comes from Sirius, the Dog Star, which becomes visible above the eastern horizon at daybreak during the summer. Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky, and is part of Canis Major, not to be confused with the Canis latrans, or coyote, in today's image, who is just trying to beat the heat.
