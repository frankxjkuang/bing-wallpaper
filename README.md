<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> The Palouse region in the Pacific Northwest is known for its picturesque landscapes, agricultural heritage, and unique geological features. Those stunning hills in our homepage image were formed over tens of thousands of years, from dust and silt blown by the wind, known as loess. The Palouse's fertile soil and climate make it ideal for farming and it is known for its wheat, barley, lentils, and other crops. With its beautiful rolling hills covered in patchworks of green and golden fields, it is often compared to Italy's Tuscany region or the French countryside.

<summary>Description</summary>

> It's International Tiger Day! A day to celebrate these magnificent animals and consider how best they can be protected. The largest wild cats in the world, all tiger species are endangered, facing challenges including habitat loss, the illegal wildlife trade, and poaching. The Bengal tiger, an iconic subspecies primarily found in India, is the star of today's image. As apex predators, Bengal tigers play a vital role in maintaining ecological balance by controlling populations of deer, wild boar, and bison. With an estimated population in the wild of between 2,500 and 3,000, tiger conservation is crucial to secure the future of this majestic species.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Nestled off the northern coast of Panama, the San Blas Islands are an archipelago of more than 360 islands in the Caribbean Sea. Known for their clean, calm waters, they are the perfect place for adventure sports such as snorkeling, surfing, and diving. Staghorn and pillar coral are among the species found in coral reefs surrounding the islands, which teem with marine life. The islands are inhabited primarily by Gunas—people indigenous to Guna Yala—who preserve their way of living with vibrant, traditional clothing, thatched-roof huts known as 'bohíos,' and intricate, handcrafted mola textiles.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Paris features an impressive stretch of parks, gardens, and monuments called the Axe historique, or historical axis, that starts at the Louvre Museum, in the city center, and extends west, ending at La Grande Arche. Today's image shows the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel at the eastern end of the route, with the embodiment of Peace riding a chariot atop it. It shouldn't be confused with the better-known and much larger Arc de Triomphe de l'Étoile, which stands 2 miles away, halfway along the Axe historique. It's a lovely walk from one to the other, through the Jardin Des Tuileries and along the famous Avenue des Champs-Élysées. If the statue on the left side of the photo caught your eye, wave hello to King Louis XIV on horseback.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Natural vegetation is sparse in the United Arab Emirates, due to its hot and dry desert climate. But along its coast, mangroves have taken root. These hardy trees and shrubs are halophytes, salt-tolerant plants that can filter 90% of the salt from the seawater they live in. Despite their resilience, mangroves are threatened globally, largely due to human activity. Mangrove coverage is thought to have halved over the past 40 years, and they are dwindling much faster than forests overall. The UN has established the International Day of Mangrove Conservation, scientific funding, Global Geoparks, and World Heritage sites to try to reverse these trends. These efforts are vital; mangroves help prevent erosion and protect against storm surges, as well as providing a home for fish, crustaceans, and other wildlife.

> When we encounter bodies of water in nature, we might expect hues of blue, from the pale cyan shade of lagoons to the navy blue of deep lakes. But pink water—where on Earth could that be found? At (deep breath) El Parque Natural de Las Lagunas de La Mata y Torrevieja in Alicante, Spain. Here, there are two lakes: one green and one pink, and it is the latter that you see on our homepage. The highly saline water, dotted with clusters of salt crystals, is the perfect environment for microscopic algae, which are rich in carotenes. This results in the rosy tinge that protects the algae from solar radiation. And the pink is just getting started, as the algae are eaten by tiny crustaceans, which turn pink and are then eaten by flamingos, which acquire the rosy hue as well.

> When it comes to honoring family members, parents and siblings get most of the attention—but today, let us sing the praises of our cousins on Cousins Day! These extended family members hold a special place in our hearts. They're not quite siblings, but more than mere friends. When we're young, they're the buddies we go adventuring with, while the adults stay behind to make small talk. Maybe you've fallen out of touch with your cousins, or maybe you're still close—either way, today's a great day to reach out, say hello, and reminisce. That's what it looks like these zebras are doing; there's likely a set of cousins or two in this group that's horsing around on the savannah in Tanzania.
