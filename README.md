<summary>Description</summary>

> Rapa Valley runs through Sarek National Park in northern Sweden, where rivers cut into lush meadows and towering peaks reach towards the sky. In this national park, covering about 760 square miles of pristine wilderness, elk roam freely, golden eagles soar overhead, and the elusive arctic fox leaves traces of its presence in the snow. From the beauty of Abisko to the rugged peaks of Sarek, Sweden's many national parks boast a range of landscapes from glaciers to lush green forests and sandy beaches. The Sámi people have called this alpine region home since ancient times, and their cultural heritage is intertwined with the landscape. They fish the coasts, and perhaps most famously, herd reindeer.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to Lake Tekapo, on New Zealand's South Island, where the colorful spikes of flowering Russell lupines transform the landscape each November and December. The plants' blooming heads, made up of clusters of pea-like flowers, can reach up to 60 inches. While photographers flock here to capture the varied hues of purple, blue, and yellow, these striking plants are controversial. Native to North America, they are considered an invasive species here, growing in dense stands and boxing out other flora. While these plants might be appealing to tourists, they can create a negative imbalance in the region's ecosystem.

> They've been growing olives on the Spanish island of Majorca in the western Mediterranean for more than 2,000 years. Early settlers, the Phoenicians and Greeks, introduced the first olive trees but the groves in the Serra de Tramuntana range expanded during Spain's Islamic era, between 709 and 1492. Olive oil became a crucial ingredient in culinary traditions on Majorca, the largest of the Balearic Islands. One ancient tree on the island, Can Det, is estimated to be more than 1,100 years old, and is still producing olives.

> In 2011, the Serra de Tramuntana was established as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Today, tourists from all over the world visit the archipelago to taste history and the 'liquid gold.'

<summary>Description</summary>

> Diwali, the five-day festival of lights, holds significance in Hinduism, Jainism, and Sikhism. It is celebrated widely both in India, and in countries across the world with an Indian diaspora. The name 'Diwali' comes from the Sanskrit term 'Dipavali,' which means 'row of lights,' and the heart of the festival lies in the oil lamps, or 'diyas,' which illuminate homes and public spaces. They create a dazzling spectacle symbolizing the triumph of knowledge over ignorance and good over evil. The city of Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh, India, pictured in today's image, hosts one of the world's largest displays of oil lamps. Hundreds of thousands of diyas are lit on the banks of the Sarayu River during Diwali.

> Today we're at the Washington Monument to pay tribute to those who have served in the US Armed Forces. Over 41 million Americans have been in our military since the US Army was established in 1775, and today, on Veterans Day, we salute their service. Veterans Day started as Armistice Day, a commemoration of the end of combat in World War 1. In 1954, it was renamed Veterans Day, expanding its scope to honor all people who have served. Over 6% of Americans, more than 16 million people, are veterans. Their service will be recognised today at the Veterans Day National Ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, and in parades and other events across the country.

> The strange stripes in our homepage image reveal tiers of fossil beds in Badlands National Park in South Dakota. Beneath the multicolored surface lies the land's history, including the remains of ancient horses, camels, tigers, and rhinos. The barren landscape, dotted with pinnacles and prairies, was formed by two geological processes: deposition, where the layered rocks were gradually stacked up on top of each other by inland seas, winds, and rivers over millions of years, and erosion, which began about 500,000 years ago. The Red Shirt Table, at 3,340 feet, is the highest point in the park, which was established on this day in 1978. It protects 379 square miles of rocky buttes, pinnacles, and prairies. This inhospitable terrain was called 'Mako Sica,' or 'land bad' by the Oglala Lakota people, who have lived here for hundreds of years. Still thirsty for knowledge? Visit the national park's museum collection. There are over 360,000 objects that have a lot more to reveal!

> Surrounded by forests and embraced by fjords, the Norwegian port city of Drammen is a haven for outdoor enthusiasts. Birch trees flourish at high altitudes, making them a natural fit for the mountainous region. When autumn arrives, their leaves transform into a mosaic of gold and crimson, in stark contrast to their pale, slender trunks. Long associated with new beginnings and renewal, birch trees don't just look good, they provide a home and sustenance for wildlife, and can be used for firewood and in construction.
