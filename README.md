> Think of a cat that can vanish into the forest without a sound—that's the Eurasian lynx. With its tufted ears and a piercing gaze, this feline is the largest of the four lynx species. Stretching up to 42 inches in length and standing as tall as 30 inches at the shoulder, the Eurasian lynx is built for power and precision. Its padded paws aren't just for sneaking; they act like snowshoes, spreading its weight so it can chase down prey in deep winter drifts. Mostly a nocturnal hunter, it spends its days tucked away in thickets or rocky dens, venturing out under the cover of darkness to stalk deer, hares, and squirrels.
> 
> The lynx lives a solitary life. Males and females carve out their own territories, marking them with scratches and scent—like secret notes left in the forest. Their elusive nature did not protect them from humans: during the 1970s and '80s, thousands of lynx pelts were exported from Russia and China, pushing populations toward dangerous lows. Though fur trade restrictions have eased the pressure, poaching, habitat loss, and shrinking prey numbers still pose threats today.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Did you know there's a day just for mushrooms? Every October 15, National Mushroom Day invites us to discover their fascinating world. Take the amethyst laccaria, pictured here. Also known as the amethyst deceiver, its bright purple color is dazzling when young, but it fades with age and weathering, making it tricky to identify. Despite its delicate, ever-changing appearance, this jewel-toned fungus is edible and plays a vital role in the ecosystem.
> 
> Far more than pizza toppings or sautéed sides, these organisms are ecological powerhouses, essential for healthy forests. They break down dead matter, recycle nutrients, and support tree growth through underground networks called mycorrhizae. Some also help store carbon in the soil, playing a role in climate regulation. National Mushroom Day encourages curiosity. So, try a new mushroom recipe today, read about how they support our planet, or enjoy a foraging adventure. Just remember: Always harvest responsibly and never consume wild mushrooms without proper identification, as some can be poisonous.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Ever wondered what it's like to live on a movie set? Oia is about as close as it gets, part of Greece's Santorini archipelago. This village has appeared in films like 'The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants' and 'Tomb Raider,' thanks to its Cycladic houses—cube-shaped homes with flat roofs—and cliffside views that feel almost unreal. Its unique architecture has roots in the late 19th century. Sailors and merchants carved houses right into the volcanic cliffs—cool in summer and warm in winter. The white-and-blue theme is also more than just for show: houses were painted with lime wash so rainwater would run off and be collected. Today, visitors wander its cobbled lanes, explore the Naval Maritime Museum, or climb to the ruins of Agios Nikolaos Castle for unforgettable sunsets.
> 
> Nicknamed the 'Eagle's Nest,' Oia overlooks the volcanic islets of Palia and Nea Kameni, as well as Therasia, which was physically connected to Santorini before the Minoan eruption. And Santorini itself? Think of it as a crown of rock around the sea, a half-sunken caldera shaped by the eruption of 1600 BCE, one of the largest volcanic eruptions in human history.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Canyons and mesas across the US hold more than striking scenery—they carry centuries of Indigenous history. Indigenous Peoples' Day, celebrated nationally on the second Monday of October, honors that history. The holiday began gaining ground in 1992, when Berkeley, California, became the first city to replace Columbus Day with a celebration of Native cultures. It recognizes Native nations as the earliest protectors of the land and acknowledges their ongoing cultural contributions.
> 
> In Utah, nations such as the Navajo, Ute, Paiute, and Hopi maintain deep cultural and spiritual connections to the mesas, rivers, and desert lands. For these communities, the land itself is part of a living heritage—one that reaches back to the Ancestral Puebloans, who lived in what is now the Four Corners region. Renowned for farming, pottery, and architecture, they built multi-room stone dwellings that still stand today. One such site is the House on Fire Ruin in Mule Canyon, pictured here. The rock ceiling above a small cliff dwelling appears ablaze, an illusion created when sunlight hits mineral-stained sandstone. What appears mesmerizing is geology paired with human craftsmanship—an architectural remnant in harmony with its setting.

> Some places are just stops on the map, but Saranac Lake in New York's Adirondack Mountains is a destination that keeps people hooked year-round. Despite its name, this village isn't directly on the Saranac Lakes themselves but rather on Lake Flower, a wide section of the Saranac River. For centuries, the area—nicknamed 'The Capital of the Adirondacks'—was used by Indigenous peoples for hunting and travel. By the late 19th century, it gained fame as a health retreat, where Dr. Edward Livingston Trudeau pioneered fresh-air treatment for tuberculosis. The cure cottages from that era still stand today.
> 
> Today, Saranac Lake has shifted from curing patients to curing boredom. Visitors paddle the waterways, hike the High Peaks, and enjoy winter activities like skiing and ice fishing. The village also boasts a lively arts scene, with galleries, music, and community festivals making culture as central as the outdoors. Local shops and restaurants add flavor, serving everything from trout to craft beer. The annual Winter Carnival is a highlight, complete with an ice palace that looks like something out of a frosty fairy tale, proving this village knows how to make a cool impression—literally.

> Birds don't bother with passports, visas, or luggage—they just spread their wings and go. Twice a year, billions of migratory birds crisscross the globe, flying thousands of miles between breeding and wintering grounds. That epic commute is exactly what World Migratory Bird Day highlights. From the Arctic tern, which logs about 44,000 miles a year, to the tiny ruby-throated hummingbird crossing the Gulf of Mexico in a single flight, these seasonal fliers show what endurance really looks like. Observed on the second Saturday in May and October, the day also draws attention to the challenges migratory birds face: habitat loss, climate change, and light pollution can all disrupt their routes.
> 
> Among the travelers worth spotlighting is the wood duck, pictured here. This North American species has made quite a comeback after once facing steep population declines due to hunting and habitat loss. Thanks to conservation efforts and nest box programs, they are now a regular sight in wooded swamps, marshes, and lakes. While some wood ducks stay put year-round in the southern United States, northern hens migrate south when the chill sets in, heading for milder regions stretching from the southern states to Mexico.

> Some dates mark a single milestone—Fiji's October 10 marks two. On that day in 1874, the islands officially became a British colony. Almost a century later, in 1970, the same date saw Fiji raise its own flag and declare independence. Fiji Day is a unique national holiday—part reflection, part celebration. The day begins with formal ceremonies, where the Fijian flag is hoisted and leaders deliver speeches. Schools and community groups often stage reenactments and performances. Streets fill with parades, villages host cultural dances like the meke, and rugby pitches come alive with matches. Families prepare traditional dishes like lovo, where meat and root crops are cooked underground, and kokoda, a citrus-marinated fish dish.
> 
> Today, the spirit of freedom stretches from bustling towns to remote gems like the island of Monuriki, pictured here. Known worldwide as the filming site of 'Cast Away,' the island is uninhabited—but far from lifeless. Its surrounding coral reef acts as a natural fortress, protecting the island from storms while sheltering countless species of fish. The reefs of Fiji are a fitting metaphor: strong, diverse, and deeply connected to the well-being of the nation.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
