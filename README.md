<summary>Description</summary>

> Moloka'i, often called the most Hawaiian of the islands, offers a slower rhythm shaped by nature and strong community ties. Formed by volcanic activity more than a million years ago, the island covers about 260 square miles and rises from the Pacific Ocean in long ridges and broad valleys. Unlike its busier neighbors, Moloka'i has resisted large-scale development, preserving a strong sense of local cohesion where families, traditions, and stewardship of the land encapsulate central values. Life here focuses on the ocean, the land, and stories passed down through generations.
> 
> Seen in today's image, Olo'upena Falls towers above the island's north shore. Dropping 2,953 feet down steep sea cliffs, the falls are fed by seasonal rains and often fan into delicate silver streams. The surrounding sea cliffs, among the highest on Earth, are accessible only by helicopter or boat, adding to their mystique.
> 
> Today, Moloka'i's quiet roads, uncrowded beaches, and close-knit community offer a rare chance to experience Hawaii as it once was—peaceful, welcoming, and deeply connected to the land.

<summary>Description</summary>

> International Polar Bear Day underscores how closely these Arctic giants are tied to their frozen realms. Celebrated on February 27, the day shines a light on polar bears and the rapidly changing world beneath their paws. The world's largest land carnivores roam across vast icy landscapes, sometimes covering hundreds of miles in search of food. They're perfectly adapted to life on sea ice, with large paws that can span nearly a foot and help them swim for miles.
> 
> This time of year is especially important because it's when mothers and their newborn cubs stay tucked inside snow dens. These chambers, often dug into deep drifts, provide warmth and safety during the harsh Arctic winter. Cubs are tiny at birth—about one pound—and rely completely on their mother for survival until they're strong enough to venture out in spring.
> 
> International Polar Bear Day reminds us that shrinking sea ice threatens this cycle. By reducing carbon emissions and supporting conservation efforts, we can help protect the vast Arctic habitats polar bears depend on. Every action counts toward their future.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Every day at Grand Canyon National Park tells a story, but February 26 is a special one. It marks the Grand Canyon's designation as a national park in 1919, a milestone that helped protect one of the most iconic natural wonders in the United States. At the heart of it all flows the Colorado River, winding for hundreds of miles through layered stone, quietly shaping the canyon one season at a time.
> 
> For visitors in the area, the anniversary is a perfect chance to slow down and explore. Ranger-led programs and talks highlight the canyon's geology, wildlife, and cultural history. A walk along the South Rim offers sweeping views where California condors circle overhead, while elk, mule deer, and bighorn sheep roam the park's diverse habitats. Stargazing and scenic overlooks add to the experience, especially during winter's clearer nights.
> 
> You don't need to be nearby to take part. The National Park Service provides live webcams from viewpoints across the park, sharing real-time sunrises, weather shifts, and daily rhythms. Whether in Arizona or far away, February 26 is an open invitation to connect with the Grand Canyon in your own way.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Hidden just outside Juneau, Alaska, the Mendenhall Glacier feels almost unreal, inside and out. Step into one of its rare blue ice caves, and the world turns quiet and luminous, with light filtering through centuries-old compacted ice. The glacier stretches about 13 miles from the Juneau Icefield, slowly flowing toward the valley below and reshaping itself year by year.
> 
> Its striking blue color comes from the ice's density, which absorbs most wavelengths of light and leaves behind vivid shades of blue. These caves are fleeting by nature, forming as meltwater carves tunnels through the glacier and disappearing, or collapsing entirely, as conditions shift.
> 
> While reaching the caves has become increasingly rare and unpredictable, the glacier remains closely studied and deeply admired. Over the past century, it has retreated dramatically, offering scientists a visible record of environmental change. Inside these glowing chambers, beauty and fragility meet, creating a powerful reminder of how dynamic and temporary Alaska's frozen landscapes truly are.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Floating lilies, glass-clear pools, and a hidden world below: welcome to the Grand Cenote in Tulum, Mexico. This natural sinkhole formed thousands of years ago when collapsing rock let aquifer waters in. Over time, the chamber filled with clear freshwater that now connects a vast underground system of caves. At first, our eyes rest on the still surface. The water lilies we see in the image float without hurry, their broad leaves catching sunlight while supporting rich ecosystems underneath. These botanical wonders belong to one of the oldest flowering lineages on Earth, dating back more than 125 million years—older than most dinosaurs. Each bloom has evolved clever tricks to attract pollinators—beetles, bees, flies, and even the wind—using scent, shape, and timing to ensure survival in still water.
> 
> As we look closer, the scene comes alive: below, fish weave through submerged roots and turtles glide through leafy shade. Overhead, dragonflies trace arcs while tiny insects spark ripples across the water. Drifting gently among the lilies, we find ourselves surrounded by nature's artistry—where every movement, reflection, and shadow reveals rhythms millions of years in the making.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The great egret is a striking large heron, easily recognizable by its pure white plumage, long neck, and sharp yellow bill. Known for its cosmopolitan distribution, it occupies habitats around the world and adapts well to many aquatic environments. Adults measure about 37 to 41 inches in body length, with a wingspan of 4.3 to 4.8 feet, and weigh about 2.2 pounds, giving them a tall, elegant silhouette—roughly chest‑high when compared to a 6‑foot-tall person. As carnivores, they feed primarily on fish but also take amphibians, insects, small mammals, and occasionally reptiles. Their patient hunting style, standing motionless before striking with sudden precision, is one of their most distinctive traits.
> 
> In today's image, this statuesque bird stands in the snow in Upper Bavaria, Germany, its white feathers blending into the winter landscape. Despite the freezing air, its presence is calm and peaceful, lending an almost contemplative feel to the scene. The egret appears poised and attentive, a quiet sentinel in the stillness of the frozen landscape.

<summary>Description</summary>

> 'Shivering Mountain' is a dramatic nickname, but Mam Tor has earned it over hundreds of years. Rising above Castleton in England's Peak District, it lies within the United Kingdom's first national park, which spans 555 square miles. This landmark takes its name from Old English, 'mam' meaning 'mother,' a nod to the smaller hills it appears to cradle. Yet this 'mother mountain' is famously unstable. Its layers of shale and sandstone have caused landslips for centuries, including a collapse that permanently closed the A625 road in 1979.
> 
> Long before modern engineers battled its shifting slopes, Bronze Age people built a large hillfort on Mam Tor's summit around 3,500 years ago. The ridge still shows traces of a settlement, with roundhouses and ancient trackways that reveal its long‑standing importance.
> 
> Geologically, this 1,696‑foot peak showcases the Peak District's turbulent past. Its cliffs reveal layers formed in tropical seas over 320 million years ago, while nearby caverns—such as Blue John Cavern—hold minerals found in very few places on Earth. Today, Mam Tor remains one of the park's most iconic walks, offering a ridge path that feels both wild and wonderfully accessible.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
