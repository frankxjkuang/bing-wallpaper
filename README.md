> Have you called your nana, abuela, pop-pop or lolo lately? No matter what you call them, there's no better time to pick up the phone than Grandparents' Day, held on the Sunday after Labor Day. Grandparents play a special role in our lives, helping to raise new generations, passing down family history and sharing the wisdom of their experience. Wisdom is not always indicated by a thick Wilford-Brimley-esque mustache, but whiskers do lend a certain esteemed quality. Perhaps that's why these Atlantic walruses look like they're about to tell you why they voted for Hubert Humphrey.

> When the sun sets over Thailand, the Wat Chaiwatthanaram Buddhist temple lights up to welcome the night at the Ayutthaya Historical Park. These ruins are evidence of the area's rich history as the capital of the Ayutthaya Kingdom, which grew in power between the 14th and 18th centuries to rule Siam, or present-day Thailand. Around 1630, Wat Chaiwatthanaram was built on the orders of the dynasty's King Prasat Thong, to symbolize the center of the universe and connote his aspiration to become the future Buddha.
> 
> From the temple, the Historic City of Ayutthaya, a UNESCO World Heritage site, can be reached by boat or road. Three rivers link the once-metropolitan city to the sea. Now a historical ruin, Ayutthaya was an important point of commerce and diplomacy, with its surrounding rivers serving as a natural defense.

The largest is held here, in the English city of Bath, where Austen lived from 1801 to 1806. On September 8, International Literacy Day, the city begins its annual 10-day Jane Austen Festival with hundreds of Austen fans walking the streets dressed in costumes from Britain's Regency era, in the early 19th century.

> Desert-dwelling camels have been central to lives in the United Arab Emirates for thousands of years. A key mode of transportation for Bedouins, camels long helped them traverse the sweltering sands in search of water and supplies. These dromedaries were also used as currency to fulfill obligations such as dowries or zakat, an annual charitable fee in Muslim communities. Camel milk is a valuable and nutritious ingredient in many recipes in the region, while camel racing keeps people entertained to this day, illustrating the versatility of these hardy creatures.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Labor Day is a well-earned day of rest for many workers across America. The food we eat, the shelter over our heads, and the transportation that moves us around all exist thanks to our collective labor. Organized labor movements grew in the 19th century, along with calls for a day to honor workers' contributions. The first Labor Day was celebrated with a parade in New York City in September 1882 and similar events spread throughout the country. In 1894, President Grover Cleveland signed a bill declaring the first Monday in September as Labor Day. Today, Labor Day marks the unofficial end of summer, but let's not forget to take a moment to give thanks for the work we all put in to take care of our communities, our families, and ourselves.
