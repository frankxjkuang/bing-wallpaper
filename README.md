> As daylight fades, dusky eagle-owls, the silent hunters seen in today's image, emerge from their nests. These primarily nocturnal raptors were snapped in Pakistan and can be found in the forests and scrublands across South and Southeast Asia. An impressive wingspan of 15–17 inches, piercing yellow eyes, and exceptional hearing help them to catch small mammals and birds with precision in dim light. Measuring up to 2 feet tall, these feathered predators can also be spotted hunting in the daytime when the weather is cloudy. They often live in the abandoned nests of other birds or in natural crevices. Dusky eagle-owls breed in December and January, usually rearing their young in the safety of tall trees or cliff ledges. Nature lovers and bird watchers are captivated by their solemn gaze and elegant stature.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Sometimes it's nice to get away. Thanks to environmentalist Howard Zahniser, Americans can do that in one of the country's many wildernesses—sheltered from human activities. While the protection of national forests and parks began in the late 1800s, untamed wilderness had dwindled to only 2.5% of US land by the 1960s. To reverse this trend, Zahniser wrote most of what became the Wilderness Act. Signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson on September 3, 1964, today it protects more than 109 million acres—5% of the land in the US.
> 
> Pictured in today's image, Crystal Lake, in the Enchantments, Washington, is in one such protected area. Located in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, the Enchantments region has more than 700 lakes and ponds and some of the best rock climbing in the Western US. It's also home to mountain goats, ptarmigan, pikas, and many alpine flowers. If you want to see Alpine Lakes Wilderness yourself, however, be prepared to wait. Few permits are granted for day hikes, and of the 40,000 people who entered last year's lottery for overnight permits, only 2,558 received one.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Take a load off this Labor Day weekend. One of 11 federal holidays, Labor Day honors America's workers and is celebrated on the first Monday of September. Its origins are rooted in late 1800s' efforts to recognize workers contributions, which ultimately led to the 40-hour work week. President Grover Cleveland made the US holiday official in 1894. Today, many Americans celebrate the long weekend, which is often considered the unofficial end of summer, by grilling, hanging out with friends and family, and going to parades.
> 
> Today's image, the 'Power of the Titans' mural by Andrei Krautsou, depicts railroads and industry in North Kansas City, Missouri. It adorns the wall of a local manufacturer whose heritage is also celebrated in the work. Kansas City is a major rail hub and one of the country's largest distribution centers—just the kind of place from which Krautsou, an artist from Belarus who is fascinated with cultures and histories, draws inspiration.

> Welcome to the Totally Thames Festival in London, England. Each year it brings together communities, artists, and nature enthusiasts in a month-long tribute to the river. Highlights for 2024 include the annual boat marathon, Great River Race, and the Clean Thames Challenge.
> 
> The Thames, the longest river entirely in England, contains more than 80 islands along its course. Starting in Gloucestershire in southwest England, it winds through cities like Oxford, Windsor, and London, pictured above, flowing for 215 miles before merging with the North Sea on the southeast coast. Once heavily polluted, it is now said to be one of the world's cleanest rivers flowing through a major city and is a haven for an array of wildlife including mute swans and bottlenose dolphins.

> From the Mediterranean coast to the vast Sahara, Algeria in North Africa has a wide variety of landscapes. Today, we're exploring the area around the Tassili n'Ajjer plateau. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is famed for its rock formations and cave art. More than 15,000 ancient engravings, some dating back 12,000 years, depict scenes of daily life, hunting, and mystical beings.

> Djanet, a nearby oasis city, is known as the Jewel of the Desert. It is surrounded by rocky plateaus. Here, palm groves and gardens create a stark, beautiful contrast to the golden landscape. Djanet is home to roughly 15,000 people, most of whom belong to the Kel Ajjer Taureg community. You can get a feel for the city in its museum, or by wandering its streets, which are lined with colorful markets, mosques, and earthen houses.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we’re celebrating the world's largest fish, the whale shark. These gentle giants can grow up to 40 feet long, with one reaching a record 61.7 feet. Found in tropical oceans, these filter feeders glide through the water, mouths wide open, straining plankton and small fish. The patterns on their dotted, starry skin are as unique as a human fingerprint. Sadly, the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists whale sharks as endangered due to overfishing, habitat loss, and climate change.
> 
> Amid adversity, there is hope at places like Cenderawasih Bay in Indonesia, a whale shark oasis that's pictured here. At this bay, these titans dine on the generosity of fishermen who feed them baitfish for luck, reflecting a unique bond between man and marine life.
