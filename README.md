<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to Rothenburg ob der Tauber, or 'Red Fortress above the Tauber River,' where medieval charm is around every cobbled corner. A self-ruling city in the Middle Ages, this walled Bavarian town once flourished with 6,000 inhabitants, the Holy Roman Empire's second-largest city at the time. The growth of Rothenburg ob der Tauber slowed in the 17th century, preserving its original character.
> 
> Pictured here is the Burgtor (castle gate), which was built after the original Rothenburg Castle was destroyed by an earthquake in 1356. Within the castle gate is an 'eye-of-the-needle' door, designed to be the only way in and out once the main gates closed at night. But Rothenburg's magic isn't confined to its walls. It's also a gateway to the 290-mile Romantic Road that runs from Würzburg to Füssen, covering Bavaria's castle-studded valleys.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Archaeology might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of festivals, but the Festival of British Archaeology, July 13-28, is here to change that. Since its inception in 1990, it has evolved into a two-week event. A clever shift from September to July has made it easier for archaeological buffs to explore summer digs and heritage wonders. This year's theme of 'Archaeology and Community' invites enthusiasts across the United Kingdom for an array of in-person and virtual events. Imagine standing amid Skara Brae's ancient stone houses on Scotland's Orkney archipelago, pictured here, where Neolithic settlers thrived over 5,000 years ago. Exposed by an 1850 storm, this prehistoric marvel is dubbed the 'Scottish Pompeii' due to its astonishing preservation—older than Stonehenge and even the Great Pyramids. So, grab your trowel, and get ready to dig deep into the incredible, storied past. Who knows what you'll discover!

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today, we're floating across the waves, following the ocean currents to Japan. Marine Day—海の日, Umi no Hi in Japanese—is celebrated on the third Monday in July. Japan has 14,125 islands and has over 18,400 miles of coastline, so it's no wonder the sea plays such a key role in its culture. It provides much of the country's food and is vital for trading and communicating with other nations.
> 
> One Marine Day tradition is to give thanks by throwing mud balls into the water; these balls are packed with microorganisms that help to purify the sea. Today's image takes us to Tateishi Park on Japan's largest island, Honshu. This scenic spot has stunning views of Sagami Bay and Mount Fuji, making it the perfect place to celebrate Japan's coastal waters.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Surrounded by rugged, dark landscapes, La Geria is a marvel of viticulture. Most of the Spanish island of Lanzarote is treeless and covered with black-gray soil. This thick blanket of volcanic gravel is the result of a series of eruptions in the 1700s. By 1775, farmers started growing crops in the new layer of nutrient-rich soil. Volcanic soil absorbs and retains moisture, and the ash keeps its temperature favorable for growing grapes. The holes surrounded by stones you see in our image were dug to protect young grape plants from strong winds. La Geria's innovative approach to cultivation in an arid climate has been rewarded with its abundance of fine wine, fermented from Malvasia grapes.

> Are you ready to make some noise? Wait, not that sort of rock. Today, we're all about granite, limestone, and slate. There are three types of rock: igneous rocks formed from magma and lava; sedimentary rocks made from a mixture of particles like sand and mud; and metamorphic rocks that are the result of heat and pressure on other kinds of rock.
> 
> Today's image takes us to the 'fairy chimneys' of Cappadocia in central Türkiye. These cone-shaped pillars are made of tuff, a sedimentary rock formed from volcanic ash and debris. In the sides of the rocks, ancient residents carved homes and churches. The area is also famous for its underground cities, which were cut out of the tuff to provide shelter and safety. This is just one of the many uses for rocks that humans have come up with throughout history.

> In the shadow of Mount Rainier, a carpet of wildflowers bursts into life. Every summer, the meadows around this mountain are colored with vivid shades of blooming subalpine flowers: purple asters, pink coralroot, and yellow tiger lilies, and more. Also known as Tahoma, at over 14,400 feet, Mount Rainier is the tallest mountain in the state of Washington. It is covered by 36 square miles of glaciers and permanent snowfields, the highest glacier ice cover of any mountain in the lower 48 states.
> 
> Mount Rainier National Park encompasses mountains, waterfalls, meadows, and old-growth forests and teems with life, from cougars and beavers to bald eagles and peregrine falcons. It is also a popular climbing destination, with some 10,000 people attempting to scale the mountain every year while others enjoy hiking along its trails. It's never sunnier in Rainier than in July and August, making summer the perfect time to visit.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In 1987, sometime around July 11, the world population reached the 5-billion mark. The United Nations recognized the need to address issues like family planning, infrastructure, waste, and pollution and established World Population Day in 1989. It is estimated that we hit 8 billion people in November 2022 and the UN expects the world to reach 9.7 billion people in 2050. But not everywhere faces the same challenges. While some areas struggle with overcrowding, others grapple with decreasing populations. The Italian town of Gangi, Sicily, seen in today's image, had about 16,000 residents in the 1950s. Today, it is home to little more than 6,000. Keen on revitalization, Gangi attracts new residents by giving away abandoned houses, on the condition that the properties are then restored.

As civilizations rise and fall around them, these hardy trees remain resilient and steadfast.
