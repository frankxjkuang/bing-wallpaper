> Celebrating the first new moon of the lunar calendar, an estimated 2 billion people gather worldwide to usher in the Lunar New Year with vibrant celebrations and family reunions. The festivities, also known as the Spring Festival or Chinese New Year, last for 15 days, ending with the Lantern Festival. From envelopes to lanterns, red is the dominant color, symbolizing luck and prosperity. Streets come alive with the rhythm of drums as the dragon dance takes center stage. Our homepage today shows a bird's-eye view of the dragons—elongated puppets with shimmering scales, animated by a team of dancers. Lunar New Year is a popular time for families to reunite and is said to be responsible for the world's largest annual human migration. Each year is linked to one of the 12 zodiac animals and 2024 heralds the Year of the Dragon, a symbol of nobility, power, and success.

> An unspoiled landscape carved by nature's raw power, waves crash against Pegadung Rock on the southern coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra. This remote beach boasts turquoise waters, but it is the striking rocks that steal the show, standing tall against the might of the Indian Ocean. The rock formations, some of which are 33 feet tall, have given rise to various nicknames, among them Gigi Hiu (shark teeth) and Batu Layar (rock screen) Beach. While this beach has no tourist accommodation, the nearby village of Kiluan presents a haven for visitors. For those ready to trade lounging for exploring, this Sumatran treasure awaits.

> Mount Hood graces Oregon's skyline with a pointed, snow-capped peak. At nearly 11,250 feet high, this dormant stratovolcano is the tallest mountain in the state, drawing adventurers and nature aficionados alike. With 12 named glaciers and numerous snow fields, Mount Hood offers a wintry playground all year round. It also nurtures ancient forests and provides a haven for wildlife, including cougars and wolves. Over the past 1,800 years, the volcano has erupted three times. While considered dormant, there is still a chance that it could erupt one day.

> St. James Beach is a small, sheltered beach on Cape Town's coastline, where vibrant Victorian bathing boxes sit side by side against an azure ocean backdrop. However, it's the St. James Tidal Pool, pictured on our homepage, that steals the spotlight. This protected bathing area, built between rugged rocks, offers crystal-clear waters for a tranquil swimming experience. The pool is warm compared with the ocean, teems with small marine life, and is perfect for floating around without worrying about strong currents. For those who like to stay dry, the beach is perfect for leisurely strolls, soaking up the sun, and observing the rhythmic ebb and flow of the tides.

> This serene scene shows Lake Tahoe, the largest alpine lake in North America and the second-deepest lake in the US. Peeking out of those misty waters is Bonsai Rock, the unlikely home of four small trees that have taken root in its cracks. Its name was inspired by the Japanese art of growing miniature trees, which are kept in small containers and pruned to control their size. The trees on Bonsai Rock are naturally restricted by the lack of space and nutrients, so no pruning is required. Part of the purpose of bonsai is to provide an opportunity for contemplation, and this tranquil spot high in the Sierra Nevada is the perfect place to relax and explore your thoughts. It is also popular with photographers, especially at sunset.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Western Monarch Day celebrates a stunning natural phenomenon, the annual migration of thousands of flame-colored butterflies to California. Traveling south to escape the winter weather, they use air currents to help them make journeys of hundreds of miles. They descend to gather in large numbers on eucalyptus trees, like the ones pictured on our homepage today in Goleta, Santa Barbara County. Those gathered to see clusters of butterflies in 100-foot-tall trees might confuse them for clumps of leaves at first. However, as the sun's rays gently fall upon them, their wings will begin to flutter. Bring your binoculars and take the opportunity to witness these winged wonders huddled together. It's truly a sight to behold!

> Step through time and into the cavernous depths of Devetashka Cave in Bulgaria, a sprawling prehistoric complex which humans called home for tens of thousands of years. These days, it is home to bats, about 30,000 of them, as well as rare birds and reptiles. This karst cave was formed by erosion and is now part of a public park. Humans are thought to have sought shelter here as far back as the Early Stone Age, about 70,000 years ago, and many Neolithic artefacts from 6000-4000 BCE have been discovered. Several large openings in the cave cast natural light into the chambers, offering better illumination for photographers and nature lovers alike.
