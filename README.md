<summary>Description</summary>

> Natural vegetation is sparse in the United Arab Emirates, due to its hot and dry desert climate. But along its coast, mangroves have taken root. These hardy trees and shrubs are halophytes, salt-tolerant plants that can filter 90% of the salt from the seawater they live in. Despite their resilience, mangroves are threatened globally, largely due to human activity. Mangrove coverage is thought to have halved over the past 40 years, and they are dwindling much faster than forests overall. The UN has established the International Day of Mangrove Conservation, scientific funding, Global Geoparks, and World Heritage sites to try to reverse these trends. These efforts are vital; mangroves help prevent erosion and protect against storm surges, as well as providing a home for fish, crustaceans, and other wildlife.

> When we encounter bodies of water in nature, we might expect hues of blue, from the pale cyan shade of lagoons to the navy blue of deep lakes. But pink water—where on Earth could that be found? At (deep breath) El Parque Natural de Las Lagunas de La Mata y Torrevieja in Alicante, Spain. Here, there are two lakes: one green and one pink, and it is the latter that you see on our homepage. The highly saline water, dotted with clusters of salt crystals, is the perfect environment for microscopic algae, which are rich in carotenes. This results in the rosy tinge that protects the algae from solar radiation. And the pink is just getting started, as the algae are eaten by tiny crustaceans, which turn pink and are then eaten by flamingos, which acquire the rosy hue as well.

> When it comes to honoring family members, parents and siblings get most of the attention—but today, let us sing the praises of our cousins on Cousins Day! These extended family members hold a special place in our hearts. They're not quite siblings, but more than mere friends. When we're young, they're the buddies we go adventuring with, while the adults stay behind to make small talk. Maybe you've fallen out of touch with your cousins, or maybe you're still close—either way, today's a great day to reach out, say hello, and reminisce. That's what it looks like these zebras are doing; there's likely a set of cousins or two in this group that's horsing around on the savannah in Tanzania.

> Legend has it that tea was first brewed accidentally around 2737 BC in China thanks to a strong wind and some loose leaves. If you find that hard to swallow, there are other origin stories to choose from. However, one thing is certain—the feeling it stirs in tea drinkers worldwide. From gongfu tea practice in China to darye in Korea, there are plenty of fascinating tea cultures to savor. Tea tourism has gained popularity, with visitors to tea plantations and estates learning all about their history. Our homepage image shows one such place, Nuwara Eliya's Edinburgh Estate in the central highlands of Sri Lanka. Nuwara Eliya's colonial-era buildings and mist-shrouded tea gardens have earned it the name 'Little England.' The area is known for producing some of the world's finest orange pekoe tea. So, for your next trip, are you willing to 'chai' something new?

> Norway's picturesque Atlantic Ocean Road crosses eight bridges as it makes its way across islands, islets, and reefs to link the island of Averøya with the mainland Romsdal Peninsula. The longest of them, pictured here, is the Storseisundet Bridge. This bridge, surrounded by ample natural beauty, was tough to build. It took six years, and during construction workers were pelted by the region's unpredictable weather, including 12 hurricanes. It opened in 1989 and remains a popular visitor attraction. With its dramatic curve and sudden incline, Storseisundet Bridge creates the illusion of suddenly disappearing into the ocean, making drivers skip a heartbeat. Its construction showcases the brilliance of Norwegian engineering, blending seamlessly with the landscape.

> International Moon Day is celebrated on July 20, the day humans first set foot on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission in 1969. It recognizes our lunar achievements and highlights scientific and technological advancements, like NASA's Orion spacecraft, seen here. Designed for deep space exploration, Orion completed a test flight to the moon without astronauts in 2022 and will carry out a crewed orbit in 2024. The plan is to return astronauts to the moon's surface in 2025. NASA hopes that these flights, along with events like International Moon Day, will encourage public engagement and education about the moon and its influence on Earth, as well as the potential for future space exploration and colonization.
