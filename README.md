<summary>Description</summary>

> It's been almost 200 years since poinsettias were first brought to the US from their native Mexico, where the Aztecs used the leaves to make dye and the sap to treat fevers. American botanist and government representative Joel Roberts Poinsett introduced the scarlet foliage to the US in 1828. Flash forward to the 1960s, when a breeding program resulted in hardier, fuller plants and many variations. The booming poinsettia wholesale trade in the US brings in a whopping $250 million a year. The House of Representatives designated December 12 as Poinsettia Day in 2002. Poinsettias are the top-selling potted plant in the US and Canada, brightening holiday tables every December.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Jasper National Park boasts numerous breathtaking waterfalls, but the multi-tiered cascade of Tangle Creek Falls makes for a must-see spectacle. Located off the Icefields Parkway (Highway 93) in Alberta, the falls are easily accessed. Tangle Creek Falls' misty spray can be felt out on the highway itself. If you're looking to capture some breathtaking shots, it may be worth getting off the highway and going closer to the falls to truly soak in its beauty.

<summary>Description</summary>

> More than 2 miles above sea level, near the crest of the Andes, is an anomaly of the natural world, a salt flat bigger than many countries. The Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia is the largest salt flat in the world at about 4,000 square miles. The salt flat is the remains of an ancient lake that evaporated long ago leaving behind a thick mineral crust that is both a source of edible salt and a critical breeding ground for, of all things, flamingos. But for a battery-hungry world, the greatest riches might lie below the crust—a vast brine rich in lithium.

> These handsome beasts are a living legacy of primeval times—they've watched history unfold around them from the era of the woolly mammoth.  The cow and calf in our photo belong to Norway's only herd of muskoxen, and you can visit them in Dovre-Sunndalsfjella National Park. If you feel like roaming by yourself, follow the signposted Musk Ox Trail; just be aware that the massive animals are known to attack if they feel threatened, so give them a wide berth. That sound too scary? Jump on a park safari with an experienced guide who can keep you safe and help you see the muskox in all its hairy glory.

> Considered the birthplace of the Renaissance, Florence helped lead Europe out of the Middle Ages as a center of politics, finance, art, and culture. Seven-odd centuries later, it's a snap to get aerial views of that era's marvels, like the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore (known more simply as the Cathedral of Florence). A crowning achievement in a city of crowning achievements, the complex includes a campanile, or bell tower, and a white-roofed baptistery in addition to the cathedral with its grand dome.

> While most know the US entered World War II after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, fewer know that the battle on December 7, 1941, actually started here on Oahu's eastern shore at the old Kaneohe Bay Naval Air Station. Now a Marine Corps airfield, the base lies beyond the small, cone-shaped Mokoli'I Island in the background of this image.
> 
> Kaneohe Bay is a protected notch along the windward shore of Oahu, about 10 miles from Pearl Harbor. To ensure a successful attack, the Japanese first destroyed American air defenses here, taking out dozens of planes before moving on to the ships tied up at Pearl Harbor—starting a chain of events that would alter the world.

<summary>Description</summary>

> We're heading down to Florida today to celebrate the 75th year of Everglades National Park, the largest tropical wilderness in the United States. The park was established in 1947 to defend a fragile ecosystem and covers about 20% of the entire Everglades wetland. But even with the park service's protection, the Everglades' features, primarily shallow freshwater pools, have suffered significantly due to human activity.
> 
> For example, the park is the most important North American breeding ground for wading birds, like the great egret seen in today's photo. Though great egrets are a robust and widespread species, breeding pairs in the park have declined to a tenth of what they once were. And great egrets are just one of 40 species native to Florida listed as endangered or threatened in the Everglades—so one can see why this unique corner of the country demands protection.
