> What an unearthly view! This aerial photograph shows a flamboyance of lesser flamingos against the backdrop of Lake Magadi in Kenya. The lesser flamingo is one of six species of flamingo, a bird known for its vibrant pink plumage and distinctive feeding behavior. They use their specialized beaks to filter algae near the water's surface and are often found in African soda lakes like Lake Magadi, which are brimming with cyanobacteria and algae for them to eat. The spectacle of thousands of these avian wonders congregating at the lake reveals the importance of these unique ecosystems.

> These fascinating red hoodoos of Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah are best explored on foot! The park's hiking trails guide you among the world's largest collection of hoodoos, which are rock spires formed by erosion. The horseshoe-shaped natural amphitheaters create a surreal landscape that changes with the play of sunlight. The area was initially inhabited by Native American tribes, including the Paiute people. Although there is no evidence of them having lived there permanently, Paiute Indians used the Paunsaugunt Plateau for seasonal hunting and gathering. Designated a national park in 1928, Bryce Canyon is dotted with several viewpoints like Inspiration Point, Yovimpa Point, and Rainbow Point, which offer panoramic vistas of the surrounding topography.

> Feeling sluggish from the effects of daylight saving time? Don't worry, National Napping Day has you covered! This holiday, introduced in 1999 by Boston University professor William Anthony and his wife, Camille, promotes naps and their short-term benefits to mental alertness. Take a cue from today's image; this sleepy koala may inspire you to catch some Z's. These adorable Australian marsupials can sleep up to 20 hours a day, which helps them conserve the little energy they get from their eucalyptus-based diet. Koalas move slowly when awake, spend most of their time tucked into nooks in trees, and have a lower body temperature than other animals of their size. Let's find some time today to sneak off to a peaceful spot to experience the benefits of Napping Day.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Time is of the essence today: The second Sunday of March marks the start of daylight saving time. At 2 AM the clocks sprang forward one hour, meaning there will be an extra hour of daylight this evening. While Benjamin Franklin is often credited with inventing daylight saving, the first real proposal for changing the clocks came in 1895 from New Zealand entomologist George Hudson, who valued having more daylight so he could collect insects after work.
> 
> Daylight saving is now observed in about 70 countries around the world, with many places adjusting their clocks in March. The clock in today's image is in the San Jacinto Building in Beaumont, Texas, which was built in the 1920s. Each clock dial is 17 feet in diameter, so it must be quite a job to put the time forward for daylight saving!

<summary>Description</summary>

> Time is the great transformer, changing the world and all of us. For instance, this New Mexico badland—the Bisti/De-Na-Zin Wilderness—was once a lush, tropical forest. Nearly 70 million years ago, instead of twisted terrains and towering spires, this place was home to an array of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs, including armored Ankylosaurs, duck-billed Hadrosaurs, and mighty Tyrannosaurs. Today, the area is filled with wonders of a different kind, rock formations that look more like sculptures than natural phenomena. Bisti/De-Na-Zin is named after Navajo words: Bisti means 'among the adobe formations,' and De-Na-Zin means 'standing crane,' a reference to nearby rock carvings of the bird. Visitors to the Four Corners region shouldn't miss out on this otherworldly landscape of shale and sandstone.

> Happy International Women's Day! We celebrate IWD with London's famous Tate Modern art gallery, lit up in purple. Why purple? The color associated with IWD symbolizes dignity, justice, and loyalty to the cause. This event celebrates women's achievements in politics, culture, and society. Every year on March 8, educational and cultural activities, demonstrations, campaigns, and discussions highlight the importance of gender equality and women's rights.
> 
> The first Women's Day was initiated by Theresa Malkiel, a labor activist, and took place in New York City on February 28, 1909, organized by the Socialist Party of America. The first international day was celebrated in 1911, although the date was not fixed as March 8 until 1917. It would be another 60 years before it was officially recognized by the UN, in 1977.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Jutting into the sky above Els Ports Natural Park, the Roques de Benet are a cluster of rock formations in Catalonia, Spain, whose tallest peak stands about 3,330 feet above sea level. Overlooking the vast wetlands of the Ebro Delta, the peak offers views of streams and pine forests, with trails that lead into the mountains. The word 'Benet' comes from Arabic, hinting at the area's varied past, including both Arabic and Christian settlers. These days, the park is home to a variety of wildlife, from ibex and otters to vultures and eagles. Animals aren't the only inhabitants of the area. The villages nestled at the base of this massif still maintain their shared traditions, such as the age-old craft of using vegetable fibers to create baskets and kitchen utensils.
