<summary>Description</summary>

> Built on a hill and surrounded on three sides by the Tagus River, the Spanish city of Toledo is a UNESCO World Heritage Site packed with history. Its towering Alcázar fortress and impressive Gothic cathedral dominate the skyline, but the city is also home to mosques and synagogues. Toledo bears strong cultural influences from the Moors, who ruled here for centuries, following their arrival in Spain in 711. It was known as the City of the Three Cultures during the Middle Ages, when its Christian, Muslim, and Jewish communities coexisted harmoniously. Toledo has been the home of sword making since Roman times and is also famous for its marzipan. In the 16th century, the city was home to the famous painter El Greco, who was inspired to create some of his greatest masterpieces here.

> Imagine spending the day hiking amid these moss-covered trees instead of frantically checking items off your holiday shopping list. Welcome to Green Friday, the environmental alternative to Black Friday. The aim is to encourage people to make ethical shopping choices—or to refrain from shopping altogether and embrace nature instead.
> 
> A good place to start is the Hall of Mosses at Olympic National Park, in Washington's Hoh Rain Forest. This fantastical landscape is a temperate rainforest with an enchanting loop trail through mosses gracefully draped over majestic spruces and hemlocks. Bring a jacket though; this forest is the wettest in the contiguous United States with an annual rainfall of nearly 130 inches. No wonder it's so green!

<summary>Description</summary>

> While people gather across the country for feasts of turkey, mashed potatoes, and stuffing, you may wonder about the origins of Thanksgiving. Early English settlers had plenty to be thankful for, whether surviving the long voyage to America or the first harsh winters. Written records tell of an early thanksgiving shared between Plymouth Pilgrims and Wampanoag Native Americans, who provided a harvest of corn, deer, and turkey. There were many early days of thanksgiving, but an official, national celebration was proclaimed by George Washington in 1789, and has been a part of our holiday season ever since. Today, we wish you good company and plenty of things to be thankful for. Happy Thanksgiving!

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today's image gives us a glimpse of beautiful Grand Teton National Park, in our least populous state, Wyoming. The park, established in 1929, encompasses lakes, the Snake River, and the Teton Range, famed for its series of sharp, jagged peaks. Bring your binoculars with you, and if it's summertime, be on the lookout for pronghorn, which travel about 150 miles to get there from Wyoming's Upper Green River Basin. They aren't the only creatures to visit seasonally; elk and bison are also summer visitors. These migrations play a vital role in the ecosystem of Grand Teton National Park. The animals help disperse seeds and are also food for predators.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Here in Norfolk, on the east coast of England, a seasonal wildlife spectacle is underway. Between early November and January, thousands of gray seal pups are born on the shoreline, a little earlier than those on US coasts. The seal moms feed their pups on the beach for three weeks, during which time the pups gain about 4.5 pounds a day. They stay on the beach until they shed their pale fur to make way for a waterproof, mottled gray coat. Then it's time to head to the sea and learn to hunt for themselves.
