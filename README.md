<summary>Description</summary>

> She was never meant to fade away. When the RMS Queen Mary sailed in 1936, she stole the spotlight across the Atlantic—an Art Deco liner that broke speed records and carried celebrities, royalty, and dignitaries. War transformed her from a floating palace into the 'Grey Ghost,' stripped of luxury and loaded with Allied troops. In 1967, after 30 years at sea, she retired to Long Beach, where her decks now serve as hotel corridors, guided exhibits, and a living monument to maritime history.
> 
> But her legend did not dock with her anchors. Over the years, guests and crew have spoken of echoes in empty corridors, footsteps reverberating on metal floors, and the laughter of a child near the deserted pool. Ghost tours highlight these eerie stories, though historians note that deaths aboard were due to natural causes, with no murders ever recorded. Today, the Queen Mary stands as both a heritage landmark and a stage for folklore. So, is she haunted? There are no records confirming it, yet the whispers keep her stories very much alive.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Ever tried spotting a snow leopard in the wild? It's called the 'ghost of the mountains' for a reason—you're more likely to see its pawprints than the big cat itself. But every October 23, the species steps into the spotlight on International Day of the Snow Leopard, a day set aside to protect this elusive predator and its rugged home.
> 
> Snow leopards roam high-altitude ranges across 12 Asian countries, from Afghanistan to China. Their thick coats and long tails are built for survival in freezing, rocky terrain. Yet even these stealthy cats can't hide from threats like poaching, shrinking habitats, and climate change. With fewer than 7,000 left in the wild, conservation is a necessity. The image of a snow leopard mother sheltering her cubs in the rocky cliffs of the Cold Desert Biosphere Reserve in India illustrates what's at stake. That's why governments, conservation groups, and local communities team up to safeguard both the animals and their ecosystems. After all, saving snow leopards also protects water sources and biodiversity for millions of people living downstream: they act as keystone species in their alpine environment, maintaining the ecological balance through predation on herbivores. That prevents overgrazing and protects vegetation that helps retain snowmelt and maintain watershed health.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In Bulgaria, on the western slopes of the Balkan Mountains, the Belogradchik Rocks stand like a natural gallery where every formation tells a tale. Shaped over millions of years by erosion, these sandstone and limestone pillars twist and tower into outlines that locals swear resemble people, animals, and even entire scenes. That's why names like 'The Horseman,' 'The Schoolgirl,' and 'The Monks' have stuck—it's a landscape where spotting shapes feels a bit like playing nature's version of charades.
> 
> The rocks, which are on UNESCO's Tentative List, stretch for more than 18 miles around the town of Belogradchik, their colors shifting from deep red to gold depending on the light. History found a use for them, too. The Belogradchik Fortress, first built by the Romans and later reinforced by Ottomans, leans on the rocks as natural defense. Why build walls when the mountain has already done the heavy lifting? Visitors today come to hike, climb, and photograph the unusual shapes, but they often leave with something extra: stories. The Belogradchik Rocks aren't just formations—they're legends frozen in stone.

> Diwali is a vibrant Hindu festival celebrating hope, prosperity, and the triumph of good over evil. It commemorates Prince Rama's victorious return to the kingdom of Ayodhya after defeating the demon king Ravana. The festival also honors the goddess Lakshmi, who is believed to bring wealth and well-being into homes, while some communities worship the goddess Kali. During Diwali, families clean and decorate their homes, exchange sweets, and gather for prayers, creating an atmosphere of joy. Central to the celebration are diyas, small oil lamps whose glowing flames symbolize light overcoming darkness and the promise of new beginnings.
> 
> Experiencing Diwali at the Golden Temple in Amritsar, India, is a spectacular sight to behold. The temple glows with thousands of diyas and fairy lights as devotees celebrate the Sikh festival of Bandi Chhor Divas, which often coincides with Diwali.

<summary>Description</summary>

> How good would it feel if you could just hang out and do absolutely nothing all day? That's exactly what sloths do, and today, we celebrate them. International Sloth Day honors these unhurried creatures and reminds us that life doesn't always need to be rushed. Sloths are tree-dwelling mammals native to Central and South America. Their deliberate movements conserve energy, avoid predators, and even allow algae to grow on their fur, creating green camouflage among the canopy. Hoffmann's two-toed sloth, pictured here, is a prime example of the slow-paced lifestyle typical of all sloths. It spends most of its time in the trees, occasionally descending to the ground to move to a new one.
> 
> Beyond their charm, sloths play a crucial role in tropical forests. Their presence signals a healthy ecosystem, and protecting their habitats benefits various other species, including frogs and birds. Yet these gentle creatures face growing threats due to rainforest degradation. Organizations like the Sloth Conservation Foundation are working tirelessly to develop initiatives to preserve their habitats, ensuring that future generations can continue to marvel at these slow-moving icons of nature.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In Minnesota, autumn carries more than crimson leaves—it brings the crisp promise of apple season. From mid-August through late October, orchards across the state open their rows of Honeycrisp, Haralson, and dozens of other cultivars, each bred for flavor, resilience, and charm. Today's image captures that moment: branches heavy with ripe fruit, ready for harvest.
> 
> This land takes its apples seriously. The state apple, the Honeycrisp, now a world favorite, was born in the orchards of the University of Minnesota, where scientists have been cultivating apples for over a century. Throughout the fall, families flock to orchards not only for the fruit but also for hayrides, cider pressing, and the yearly ritual of choosing the perfect apple right from the tree.
> 
> Behind the simple joy lies rigorous cultivation science: here, apple breeding has shaped varieties tough enough for harsh winters and sweet enough to rival any grown elsewhere. There are more than 7,500 cultivars worldwide. Among them, Minnesota's contribution is distinctive—proof that innovation and tradition can flourish side by side, season after season.

Where written records fail, the land tells its story. Silbury Hill preserves these tales, reminding us why studying our past matters: it rewrites what we thought we knew, amplifies silenced voices, and shows us that history is never finished.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
