<summary>Description</summary>

> Goodbye winter! Today marks the spring or vernal equinox, the official beginning of springtime in the Northern Hemisphere. Starting today, regions north of the equator will have longer days than nights.
> 
> In some parts of the world, the arrival of spring is announced by the guttural chorus of tree frogs. They tend to be small and slender since their weight has to be supported by branches and twigs in their habitats. They can be recognized by the sticky discs on the tips of their fingers and toes, which help them cling to surfaces. The American green tree frog is the official state amphibian of both Louisiana and Georgia.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Over millions of years, the dazzling sandstone formation known as Elephant Rock was carved by nature. Thanks to the wind and water erosion, this 170-foot-high rock near the city of Al-Ula in Saudi Arabia took on the shape of an elephant and has become a prominent landmark in the region. As the sun sets, it casts a warm glow upon the red-hued mammoth and the golden sand of the surrounding desert.
> 
> About 7 miles from the Elephant Rock, the city of Al-Ula traces its roots back to ancient civilizations and has witnessed the passage of traders, pilgrims, and caravans crossing its arid landscapes. The surrounding area, including rock formations and Hegra's Nabataean tombs, boasts petroglyphs and inscriptions, some dating as far back as 644 CE.

> Today, we're looking out to sea from the green pastures of St Finian's Bay in County Kerry, Ireland, to celebrate St Patrick's Day. The country's patron saint introduced Christianity to Ireland around the year 432, and his passing on March 17, 461, became a day of commemoration in his homeland.
> 
> The holiday holds cultural significance in the United States, where there are over 30 million people who claim Irish ancestry, specifically in cities like Boston, New York, and Chicago. The first festivity in America took place in Boston in 1737, organized by homesick Irish soldiers to honor their heritage. The modern celebration typically includes parades, traditional Irish music, and dance performances, wearing green clothes, and indulging in Irish cuisine and beverages. Have you pinned a shamrock to your jacket yet?

> Do you like scrolling through lighthearted videos of giant pandas wobbling around? These bamboo-munching creatures, with their distinctive black and white coats and playful demeanor, have captivated hearts for years. So much so that in 1961, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) adopted the animal as its iconic logo. National Panda Day, observed on March 16, helps to raise awareness about panda conservation and their fight for survival amid the destruction of their natural habitat. To curb the threat, the Chinese government built more than 50 reserves and by 2016, pandas were reclassified from an endangered to a vulnerable species. However, with fewer than 2,000 giant pandas remaining in the wild, the fight to protect them is far from over.

> The first day of spring may be just days away, but the season's wildflowers at California's largest state park—Anza-Borrego Desert State Park—are already here to say hello! Every spring, this barren desert floor undergoes a dramatic makeover. Flowers like heliotrope, brittlebush, and desert dandelion burst into a riot of bloom, creating a spectacle of color. For those seeking a more adventurous experience, this park has a lot to offer—from the mountains of the Peninsular Ranges and cactus-studded hills to slot canyons, badlands, and natural palm oases. In addition, as a designated International Dark Sky Park, it is an exceptional spot for stargazing. Beyond its natural wonders, the park, spanning over 600,000 acres, is also home to a rich cultural and historical legacy, including ancient pictographs, or rock paintings, from the Native American tribes that once lived here.

> They say the only constant in life is change. In mathematics, however, there are many constants and today, we're celebrating perhaps the most famous of them all: pi. Represented by the symbol π, this tasty-sounding number is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, approximately 3.14159. Every March 14, mathematics fans across the world get baking to mark Pi Day with a pie. It began in 1988, when physicist Larry Shaw connected the date (3/14) with the first three digits of π. Today, mathematicians and enthusiasts celebrate Pi Day with pie eating and pi reciting. Did you know that when your clock strikes 1:59 today, you will be three decimal places closer to the real value of pi? Pi is everywhere, even in nature. Pictured here is a bodhi tree which has grown over an arch into the shape of the pi symbol at Wat Phra Ngam, a temple in Ayutthaya, Thailand. Whether you're a math geek or just in it for the treats, Pi Day is for everyone to enjoy!

> What an unearthly view! This aerial photograph shows a flamboyance of lesser flamingos against the backdrop of Lake Magadi in Kenya. The lesser flamingo is one of six species of flamingo, a bird known for its vibrant pink plumage and distinctive feeding behavior. They use their specialized beaks to filter algae near the water's surface and are often found in African soda lakes like Lake Magadi, which are brimming with cyanobacteria and algae for them to eat. The spectacle of thousands of these avian wonders congregating at the lake reveals the importance of these unique ecosystems.
