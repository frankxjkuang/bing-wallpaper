<summary>Description</summary>

> National Take the Stairs Day, observed on the second Wednesday of January, encourages everyone to add small bursts of movement to daily life. Choosing stairs instead of elevators, or fitting in a short walk or bike ride, helps build healthier habits. With millions living with chronic lung disease and air quality concerns growing, simple actions that strengthen our bodies matter more than ever.
> 
> If you want to mark the day with a climb to remember, the Fortress of Palamidi has you covered. Rising 709 feet above the city of Nafplio in Greece, this Venetian-built stronghold dates back to 1714. This impressive fortification has eight bastions, each designed as an independent unit so that if one fell, the others could still be defended. The Ottomans captured the fortress a year after completion, and Greece reclaimed it in 1822, renaming the bastions after heroes like Achilles and Leonidas. Today, visitors often test themselves on the fortress's famous staircase—once believed to have 999 steps, though the actual count is 857. At the top, sweeping views of the Argolic Gulf make every step worthwhile.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Most people wrap up their New Year plans by the first week of January. Wales, however, has a charming habit of saying, 'Hold on—we've got one more celebration left.' Enter Hen Galan, the 'Old New Year,' observed on January 13 in parts of Wales, most famously in the Gwaun Valley. The date survives from the old Julian calendar, kept long after the rest of Britain adopted the Gregorian one.
> 
> Alongside Hen Galan is Calennig, a tradition rooted in the Welsh word for 'New Year's gift.' Children lead the festivities with decorated apples—fruit studded with cloves, topped with holly, and balanced on three wooden legs. They carry the apples from house to house, reciting cheerful rhymes in exchange for coins or treats. In the past, kids would also carry jugs of water to splash on people's hands and faces or sprinkle around the house for luck.
> 
> Today, Calennig is less widespread than it once was, but the practice hasn't vanished. Schools still teach the old verses for Hen Galan, and local groups keep the customs alive. And if you ever want to see a place with apple-growing heritage, visit the Vale of Clwyd, featured in today's image.

> The clue isn't the tracks in the snow—it's the frosted faces peeking out like they've just discovered winter. Estonia is one of Europe's best places to spot Eurasian otters, thanks to its clean rivers, wide wetlands, and snack-filled coastline. This protected species was named Estonia's Animal of the Year in 2024. While globally considered near threatened, their population here has grown substantially, reaching an estimated 2,000 in recent years, up from a historic low of just 300 before the turn of the millennium.
> 
> From Soomaa National Park's flooded forests to Matsalu National Park's calm shallows, these mammals—with their streamlined bodies, webbed feet, and long tails—weave through the country's waters with ease. Their thick fur traps warm air, allowing them to dive into cold Baltic currents without hesitation. While they look cute, their hunting skills are sharp: they track fish, frogs, and crustaceans with precision.
> 
> Unlike their sea otter cousins, Eurasian otters tend to work solo, but in Estonia's wetlands, neighbors aren't far away. They communicate with whistles, chirps, and occasional snorts. When pups arrive, the banks become playful classrooms where young otters learn to swim, eat, and master the 'oops, did I splash you?' face.

<summary>Description</summary>

> On January 11, 1944, Morocco took a bold step toward freedom. Sixty-six leaders signed the Proclamation of Independence, demanding an end to French and Spanish colonial rule and affirming the country's right to sovereignty. This manifesto, backed by Sultan Mohammed V, was presented not only to colonial authorities but also to representatives of the US, UK, and the former Soviet Union—a signal that Morocco's struggle was part of a global call for self-determination. Though repression followed, the movement endured, and by 1956 Morocco achieved full independence, marking a turning point in North African history.
> 
> Today, that spirit of resilience echoes in Chefchaouen, the 'Blue Pearl' of the Rif Mountains. Founded in the 15th century as a fortress against Portuguese incursions, the city later adopted its signature blue palette—a tradition some trace to Jewish influence and others to Andalusian roots. Wandering through its serene alleys, where indigo walls meet crisp mountain air, feels like stepping into a living canvas—a reminder that Morocco's story is painted in courage, culture, and color.

> Few sights capture the spirit of the Alps like the Matterhorn mirrored in Lake Stellisee's glassy waters. Rising 14,692 feet on the Swiss-Italian border, this legendary peak has long symbolized natural beauty and adventure, drawing climbers, hikers, and dreamers from every corner of the globe.
> 
> From Zermatt—a charming, car-free village in Switzerland—the Matterhorn dominates the horizon, its jagged silhouette etched against the sky like a work of art. At Lake Stellisee, the view turns magical, especially at sunrise when the mountain's reflection glows softly on the mirrorlike surface. It feels as though time stands still, as if nature paused just for you to savor the moment.
> 
> Whether you're trekking alpine trails, photographing the shifting light, or simply breathing in crisp mountain air, this scene offers a quiet reminder of why the Alps have inspired travelers for centuries. The Matterhorn isn't just a mountain; it's a reflection of everything that makes Switzerland unforgettable.

> Step into the realm of giants. Try embracing a BFG (Big Friendly Giant) as you wrap your arms around a thousand years of wisdom in a single tree trunk. Welcome to Muir Woods National Monument—established on this day in 1908—a majestic hall of coastal redwoods just north of San Francisco. These towering redwoods are the tallest trees on Earth—one here stretches about 258 feet, roughly the height of 43 people stacked head to toe. Most are 600–800 years old, and some have stood for over a millennium, yet they're still considered 'young' for a species that can live for 2,000 years.
> 
> How do they endure? Thick, fire-resistant bark and tannins ward off insects and disease, while their roots—though only 10 to 13 feet deep—spread outward up to 100 feet and interlock with neighbors for stability. Fog drifting in from the Pacific provides nearly 40% of their water during dry summers, and fallen trees recycle nutrients as 'nurse logs,' fueling new life. As you enter this forest, bow to the trees that rise beyond life itself. Your footsteps ripple through the river of time, flowing toward the future these giants patiently await.

<summary>Description</summary>

> When a bird is called a starling, you'd expect it to be a bit of a show-off. True to its name, this little creature knows how to steal the spotlight. From shimmering feathers that glint green and purple in the sun, to its ability to mimic sounds, the starling is the headline act. Originally native to Europe and Asia, the common starling has spread across the globe. In the 19th century, a group of them were introduced to New York's Central Park by an enthusiast of birds mentioned in Shakespeare's plays.
> 
> Brighton's West Pier may be a ruin, but when starlings gather above it, the scene is anything but broken. Each evening in autumn and winter, thousands of these small birds twist and turn in the air. The spectacle is called a murmuration, a term as musical as the sound of wings beating in unison. Scientists suggest the birds swoop and swirl to confuse predators, keep warm and share information about roosting spots. Whatever the reason, the result is a dance that has visitors gazing upward, phones in hand, hoping to catch a glimpse before the flock settles for the night.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
