<summary>Description</summary>

> On Fibonacci Day, mathematicians and scientists honor one of their own: Leonardo Bonacci, better known as Fibonacci. The medieval mathematician popularized the Hindu-Arabic numeral system, with its use of zero, decimal points, and 10 numbers instead of the ponderous Roman numeral system. He's most famous, however, for his sequence of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8... By adding the first two numbers, you arrive at the third, and adding the previous two numbers, you arrive at the next number, and so on. Disregarding the zero, the first four numbers correspond to today's date, 11/23.
> 
> The Fibonacci sequence is also related to a mathematical phenomenon called the golden ratio, an irrational number that begins 1.61803 but whose terms go on forever after the decimal point. It is found in nature, including the spiral shapes of nautilus shells, sunflower seeds, pinecones, and the leaves of the spiral aloe plant in today's image. It is also found in the relationship between adjacent numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. As successive Fibonacci numbers above 5 are divided by the previous number, the answer gets ever closer to the golden ratio. These mysterious numbers intertwine in nature, creating beautiful patterns in unexpected places.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Perched atop a sandstone outcrop high in the Sierra de Caldereros stands the Castle of Zafra. When the Christian kingdoms of northern Spain took the region from its Moorish defenders in the 12th century, they built this castle on the site of an older fortress to defend the borderland between the two powers. Over the years, it withstood countless battles of the Reconquista—the military campaigns waged by Christian kingdoms against Muslim rule in Spain—and of the Castilian Civil War of the 14th century.
> 
> When the fighting ended in the late 15th century, the Castle of Zafra was no longer strategically important and began to fall into ruin. In 1971, Don Antonio Sanz Polo, a descendant of the castle's last warden, bought the site from the Spanish state. He then spent the next 30 years restoring the castle. These days, you're more likely to see the Castle of Zafra on the screen than in a history book—it doubled as the Tower of Joy in the sixth season of 'Game of Thrones.'

> Curious about what it's like to be a lion cub living in the wild? Let's explore their life. African lion cubs like those featured here, sunbathing in the wilderness of South Africa, start life tucked away in a secluded den. Blind at birth, these little ones are vulnerable in the first few weeks of their lives and depend entirely on their mothers. At around 8 weeks old, they meet the rest of the pride and learn to socialize so they can find their place in the group. After they hit 6 months, they begin to go out hunting with adults, learning essential skills through real-life adventures.
> 
> Lions enter adolescence around 2 years old, and they reach maturity by 3 or 4. At this point, young males leave their mothers and group with other males, while females remain to hunt and breed in the same pride. For the lion cubs in today's image, their early experiences will lay the foundation for their place in the wild.

<summary>Description</summary>

> What's more creative than a young mind? This World Children's Day, let's celebrate the boundless imagination of kids and the ideas they bring to life. A UNICEF initiative, this day is a global day of action for children, by children, which marks the UN's adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Kids are raising their voices on issues ranging from conflict and climate change to mental health and discrimination, in a bid to influence the future.
> 
> Featured in today's image is the giant land art painting 'Beyond Crisis' in Leysin, Switzerland. It was created by French contemporary artist Saype in 2020 in response to the pandemic. Saype is renowned for his ultra-realistic giant nature paintings—this fresco spanned over 32,000 square feet—made using biodegradable paint. Through the eyes of a little girl gazing at the horizon, the artist envisioned a more united and humane world. The arc of figures she draws serves as a powerful reminder that, in times of crisis, we must focus on what lies ahead together.

> Tasmans Arch, Tasmania, Australia (© Gary Bell/Minden Pictures)

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Ready for a coastal adventure? Welcome to Tasman National Park in Tasmania, an island state of Australia about 150 miles off its southeastern coast. Spanning more than 41 square miles, this park features dramatic cliffs and distinctive columns of dolerite rock. Tasmans Arch, seen in today's image, is a standout example. Shaped over time by the Tasman Sea, it was once the roof of a massive sea cave. The sea's pressure, combined with air, sand, and stones, slowly pried open the vertical cracks in the cliff, dislodging chunks of rock. The cave kept growing, deepening, and lengthening, until it eventually gave way, leaving behind this towering natural bridge. Tasmans Arch is named after the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman, who also lends his name to the state of Tasmania.

> Porthcawl Lighthouse, Wales (© Leighton Collins/Alamy)

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> With waves crashing against its sturdy base and a stormy sea swirling around, this lighthouse in Porthcawl, on the south coast of Wales, has been standing resilient since 1860. At 30 feet tall, Porthcawl Lighthouse, designed by the eminent engineer James Walker, is often pictured being battered by waves when storms hit. The town's rugged coastline, with its hidden rocky coves, has always posed a perilous challenge to sailors. Porthcawl Lighthouse was built to help guide the increasing maritime traffic along the Bristol Channel. This cast-iron lighthouse was the last one in the UK to be powered by coal and gas. Although it was converted to electric power in 1997, the lighthouse still maintains its historical charm.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Striking appearance, strong presence, and impressive antlers—meet the red deer, photographed in the ancient forests of Glen Affric, one of Scotland's most beautiful valleys. Found across Europe, Asia, and parts of North Africa, this species is Britain's largest land mammal and an integral part of the Caledonian pinewoods, Scotland's coniferous forests. From featuring in cave art found throughout Europe to medieval hunting traditions, red deer have always held a special place in the human imagination. In many parts of the world, their image is synonymous with the wild, free spirit of nature. Glen Affric, with its lochs, moorlands, and mountains, provides the perfect habitat for these magnificent creatures. This national nature reserve is also popular with hikers, climbers, and nature enthusiasts.
> 
> The Scottish red deer is a subspecies that is slightly smaller than its counterparts in continental Europe. This species exhibits insular dwarfism, a process where large animals evolve to have smaller bodies over many generations.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
