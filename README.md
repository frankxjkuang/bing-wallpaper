<summary>Description</summary>

> If you want to take in a soccer game and the grandiose beauty of the Norwegian Sea at the same time, this place is pitch perfect. Squeezed into a small Norwegian fishing village, it's fair to say that Henningsvær Stadion's grounds will probably never host a UEFA Champions League. But, while it lacks stands for spectators, there's still plenty of atmosphere to soak up in this striking location. Those who play here do so surrounded by the sound of waves, seabirds, and the smells of salt air and cod, drying on the racks surrounding the pitch.
> 
> Cod fishing is central to the economy here in Henningsvær, in the Lofoten Islands–but partly due to drone photography, this scenic pitch has become an important tourist attraction. Resting on a rugged island, surrounded by bare rocks and deep blue waters, watching a game here can make for a surreal and unforgettable experience.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Built between 1584 and 1611, the Cordouan Lighthouse is France's oldest working lighthouse and the only one in the country that is still inhabited by keepers. For centuries, this maritime marvel has watched over the Gironde Estuary, on France's Atlantic coast, a treacherous area where shipwrecks were once common.
> 
> Designed by engineer Louis de Foix and remodeled in the 18th century, this stunning lighthouse with its stained-glass windows and Renaissance architecture is sometimes known as the Versailles of the Seas, after the famous French palace. Others call it the King of Lighthouses.
> 
> A visit to this historic landmark will take you on a journey to a bygone era, concluding with a climb up more than 300 steps to the lighthouse's pinnacle, where you can enjoy a commanding view of the coast and Atlantic Ocean.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Peeking out above the trees in the Făgăraș Mountains of Romania is Poenari Castle, a fortress steeped in history and legend. In the 15th century, this castle was occupied by the notorious ruler Vlad III, aka Vlad the Impaler, aka Vlad Dracula.
> 
> Vlad wasn't a vampire, but he had a reputation for cruelty towards his enemies. His bloody resistance to Ottoman encroachment made him a national hero and the subject of much folklore—some of it gruesome. These tales are likely what inspired author Bram Stoker to name his fictional vampire Count Dracula.
> 
> Poenari Castle was abandoned decades after Vlad's death in 1476. Over the centuries, it fell into ruin as earthquakes and landslides sent parts of the building down the cliff and into the Argeș River below. Visiting the ruins today requires a bit of stamina. It's a 1,480-step climb to the citadel walls, unless you can change into a bat and fly to the top.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> This stunning structure is Delicate Arch, the most famous of 2,000 stone arches scattered around Arches National Park in Utah. It is made up of Entrada Sandstone, the grains of which once formed a massive desert. They were cemented together by minerals, forming sandstone riddled with tiny holes. Over millennia, the rain seeped in and slowly dissolved the rock from the inside, forming these eye-catching sculptures. Most of the arches in the national park are formed from Entrada Sandstone and were once buried by other rock layers. They won't last forever, but over time, new shapes will emerge from the layers of rock below to replace them. Every year, close to 1.4 million people visit the park to see Delicate Arch and this slowly shifting landscape for themselves.

> Vast colonies of royal azaleas paint the sides of South Korea’s Hwangmaesan Mountain a vibrant purple as summer approaches. Sightseers flock to see this striking pink and purple carpet of flowers which was created gradually as dairy cows and sheep ate the grass and plants, but left behind the poisonous azaleas which spread across the mountain.
> 
> For those who want to climb it, Hwangmaesan also features massive rock formations, stunning views, and a legend that anyone who prays at the summit will have their wish granted. It reaches an altitude of around 3,650 feet and offers a peaceful escape from city life for hikers and campers. Those who want to walk among the azaleas should head there in May, when they come into bloom. But dress appropriately, it still gets chilly up at the summit.

> Contrary to what many people believe, Cinco de Mayo is not Mexico's Independence Day, which is celebrated on September 16. Instead, May 5 marks Mexico's victory over better-equipped French forces at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. Although the French Empire would counterattack and take the city a year later, the unexpected victory was a morale boost which still has symbolic significance. While in the US, Cinco de Mayo is a popular festival celebrating Mexican American culture, celebrations in Mexico are relatively quiet and focused mostly on Puebla.
> 
> In Mexico, the celebration became known as Battle of Puebla Day after President Benito Juárez declared it a national holiday in 1862. Today, the people of Puebla celebrate with parades, speeches, and battle reenactments. The Church of Nuestra Señora de los Remedios in Puebla, pictured here, was already nearly 300 years old when the 1862 battle was fought. And human history is just the blink of an eye to ancient Popocatépetl, the smoking volcano which towers over Puebla in the background of our homepage image.
