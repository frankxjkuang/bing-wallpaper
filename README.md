<summary>Description</summary>

> For more than 400 years the city of Strasbourg, France, has transformed into a Christmas wonderland in December. Including displays such as this miniature village decorated for the holidays. Craftsmen and merchants sell ornaments and other gifts at Strasbourg's famous Christmas market. And there are plenty of satisfied customers—over 2 million visitors flock to the city every year to take in the festive sights and sounds. An immense Christmas tree is erected and decorated in Place Kléber, the central square, and the scents, songs, and twinkling lights of Christmas fill the city. It's no wonder that Strasbourg proudly calls itself the 'Capital of Christmas.'

<summary>Description</summary>

> This isolated cove on 'the Last Frontier' is the least likely place you'd expect to find a Christmas tree decorated from head to toe with lights aglow. Amalga Harbor lies about 15 miles north of Juneau (one of the few coastal state capitals in the US) and shows that the public expression of Christmas cheer knows few limitations–and may include use of a small barge. This photograph was taken from nearby Ernest Gruening State Historical Park, which was named for the former governor of the Alaska Territory. Gruening led the territory from 1939 to 1953 before becoming one of the state's first US senators when Alaska became a state in 1959. After his political career ended, he and his wife lived in a cabin that was preserved as part of this historic site.

<summary>Description</summary>

> For the uninitiated, the origins of the made-up holiday Festivus can be traced back to an episode of the hit '90s show, 'Seinfeld.' Based on the real family tradition of one of the show's writers, Festivus has taken on a life of its own in the real world and provides fans with a fun, tongue-in-cheek way to celebrate the holiday season while ignoring its pressures and commercialism.
> 
> And with today's photo, it appears these Gentoo penguins in Antarctica are well aware of Festivus, as they seem to be engaging in one of the holiday's main traditions—the 'Airing of Grievances.' As far as Gentoos go, it's not uncommon for them to have plenty of grievances to air. Whether excommunication for infidelity, or jealousy of their neighbor's nesting stones, Gentoos can be salty. Maybe that's to be expected, though, as their diets are so loaded with the stuff that they literally leak highly concentrated saline from their beaks.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Surely one of the grandest stores found in any city is the Galeries Lafayette in Paris. It's not just a place to shop but a destination as popular as any in the City of Light. At a time when department stores are fading and the entire retail industry is shifting, the Galeries Lafayette holds fast. It has survived financial crises, wars, and now the internet, remaining a celebrated part of life in Paris. Like Macy's or Rockefeller Center in New York, the Galeries Lafayette is synonymous with the holidays. A giant fir is decorated every holiday season under the store's signature stained glass dome—a ritual of Christmas cheer that Parisians have embraced for generations.

> The days only get longer from here! The Northern Hemisphere marks the beginning of winter today, but the winter solstice is also the shortest day of the year. The rainbow that encircles the sun in our image, a sun halo, is above Lake Antermoia, in the Dolomite Mountains of northern Italy. Sun halos form when sun or moon light shines through ice crystals suspended in the upper atmosphere. When the light of the sun hits the crystals they serve as a prism, separating the light into individual colors of the spectrum, the same way rainbows occur after a rain shower.

> Christmas markets win the holiday trifecta: You can buy interesting, often handcrafted gifts, they are set in picturesque, romantic towns and villages in Europe, and they tempt you with mulled wine and local delicacies. What's not to like? Christmas markets, or 'Weihnachtsmärkt,' are one of Europe's oldest Advent events.

> Our photo shows Austria's Belvedere Christmas market from across the Danube River, outside Upper Belvedere, one of two palaces on the property. If you visit a Christmas market, make the time to stroll, taking in all the sights and smells of the season. In Vienna, the architecturally impressive city goes all out for the holidays, with lights, decorations, and music, and the Belvedere Palace is a suitably dramatic backdrop.

> This scarlet winterberry shrub is the perfect hiding place for the northern cardinal. What better spot for singing in the winter holidays? Winterberry is a deciduous holly that's native to North America and can be a modest shrub or a tree reaching up to 15 feet. The yellow and green flower clusters that bloom in spring give way to bright red berries in winter.
> 
> Cardinals winter in the Midwest and the Eastern US, brightening the dreary winter months with flashes of bold scarlet. It's only the male cardinal that sports the crimson plumage. Female cardinals are mostly light brown, with a bit of red. Some people believe sighting a cardinal is good luck or a message of support from a lost loved one.

The mile-thick ice sheet that covers Antarctica accounts for 70% of the planet's supply of fresh water. To put that in perspective, if it all melted, sea levels would rise by 200 feet.

Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
