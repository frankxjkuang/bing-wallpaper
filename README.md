<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to the ancient temple of Al-Khazneh in the desert city of Petra, Jordan. Carved out of a single sandstone rock about 2,000 years ago by the Nabataean people, it is believed to have been a mausoleum for King Aretas IV. Standing 141 feet tall, its massive doorway is framed with towering columns and intricate carvings. It is the most recognizable structure of this 'rose city' of temples and tombs carved from pink sandstone.
> 
> The Nabataeans, the original inhabitants of Petra, were skilled architects who built an impressive network of cisterns and water channels here. Once a thriving center, Petra is thought to have been largely abandoned around the 8th century and was 'lost' to the Western world until the 19th century. Only the Bedouin people, who lived in the surrounding desert, knew of it, and it is they who are thought to have named it Al-Khazneh, believing it contained treasures.

> It's lunch time for these beautiful monarch butterflies, which like to feed on clusters of colorful wildflowers. While they dine out on nectar, they get a light dusting of pollen, which is then spread to other flowers they land on. This process is pollination, transferring pollen from the male part of a flower to the female part, and is crucial for growing many of our fruits and vegetables. It improves the quality and quantity of crops and increases harvest yields. Nearly $20 billion of goods are produced in the US alone each year, because of pollination.
> 
> Pollinators are a critical part of food systems and ecosystems, but their numbers have declined due to various threats including loss of habitats, pesticides, and climate change. Pollinator Week, held in June each year, aims to raise awareness of pollinators and what we can do to protect them. You can mark the week by avoiding using pesticides and creating a pollinator-friendly habitat for butterflies, bees, and other pollinators, helping them continue to play their essential role in plant reproduction.

> Welcome to the largest tropical rainforest on Earth. Our homepage image was taken in Peru, home to about 13% of the Amazon rainforest. Most of it, about 60%, is in Brazil, while 10% is in Colombia. Bolivia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela also have sections within their borders. Covering nearly 40% of South America, the rainforest is teeming with life, including endangered species like jaguars and giant otters, more than 40,000 plants, and thousands of birds and butterflies. Millions of people also live in the Amazon.
> 
> As well as sheltering thousands of species, rainforests absorb a substantial amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping to combat global warming. But they are threatened by climate change and deforestation. World Rainforest Day was created in 2017 to celebrate these critical natural resources and to raise awareness of their plight. Its founders, the Rainforest Partnership, also hosts a summit to hear from experts and discuss how individuals and communities can help protect rainforests.

> The ancient monument of Stonehenge has fascinated people for centuries. Estimated to have been built between 3000 and 2000 BCE in the English county of Wiltshire, its large standing stones remain an enigma. Exactly why and how this massive stone circle was built are still debated. What we do know, is that it was done without metal tools or the use of wheels—and some of those stones were moved more than 150 miles.
> 
> On the summer solstice, the longest day of the year, the sun rises directly over the largest stone, the Heel Stone, creating a captivating spectacle. On the winter solstice, the shortest day, the sunset aligns with the stones, casting an enchanting glow upon the ancient site. Stonehenge's precise alignment with astronomical events suggests its importance in ancient ceremonial practices, making it an iconic symbol of human ingenuity and our connection to the cosmos.

> Bald eagles are a symbol of strength, determination, and courage. The powerful bird is celebrated every year on June 20, the day it was made the national symbol of the United States in 1782. President Bill Clinton commemorated this date by declaring it American Eagle Day in 1995. The bald eagle, named for its white-feathered head, was once an endangered bird, but conservation efforts and the Endangered Species Act have helped boost its numbers.
> 
> Today's image was taken in the Tongass National Forest in southeast Alaska, which has the highest nesting density of bald eagles in the world. Eagles are picky when it comes to selecting a tree in which to nest. They like tall ones that offer a good view of their surroundings. This majestic bird stands as a proud reminder of the principles of liberty and independence that the nation was founded upon.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Juneteenth is here, a day celebrating the freedom of enslaved African Americans shortly after the end of the Civil War. While Abraham Lincoln's final Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863 freed slaves in Confederate states, certain areas did not abolish slavery until months after Confederate forces surrendered. Texas issued an order on June 19, 1865, that 'all slaves are free.' This act was the origin of Juneteenth, which combines the words June and nineteenth. However, slavery did not fully end in the US until the 13th Amendment was ratified on December 6, 1865.
> 
> The holiday has been recognized in every state since 1979. Modern celebrations and jubilees include concerts, marches, fairs, and buildings lit up with red, black, and green like we see in our photo. Juneteenth offers us the opportunity to celebrate progress while also challenging ourselves to identify the ongoing work that needs to be done.
