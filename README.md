> The grass truly is greener on the other side—especially when that side is Château de Villandry. While the Loire Valley in France is packed with stunning châteaux (French for castles), Villandry stands apart, not for its towering turrets or medieval might, but for its gardens. Built in the 16th century by Jean le Breton, a minister to King Francis I, Villandry was always meant to impress. Unlike fortified castles built for war, it was designed for comfort, featuring large windows and an open, welcoming layout. Its gardens are arranged across terraces with distinct themes. The ornamental garden showcases geometric patterns like the one pictured here. The water garden offers a serene retreat, and the vegetable garden turns everyday crops into artistic displays.
> 
> After a challenging period, the dilapidated Château de Villandry was purchased in 1906 by Spanish doctor Joachim Carvallo and his wife, Ann Coleman, an heiress to an American steel empire. Their passion for history and horticulture led to a full restoration, and their descendants continue to maintain the estate today. These gardens change with the seasons, ensuring that no two visits are exactly alike. Whether you have a green thumb or not, it's hard not to admire the precision at play.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Here's a place where the wild rules and nature moves at its own pace. Moremi Game Reserve stretches across the eastern side of Botswana's Okavango Delta, covering 1,900 square miles. Established in 1963, it became Africa's first reserve created by local people—the Batawana, a Bantu ethnic group native to Southern Africa—to protect the region's wildlife from uncontrolled hunting. The combination of permanent water and dry land makes it one of the best places in Africa to observe wildlife in its natural habitat.
> 
> One animal you're almost certain to spot is the impala. These medium-sized antelopes are active mainly during the day. Males fight fiercely for dominance during the breeding season, or rut, locking horns in dramatic battles. After a six-month gestation period, females give birth to a single fawn. Outside the mating season, they stick together in herds—the territorial males, bachelor herds, and female herds—always on the lookout for predators. When danger strikes, they freeze, only to explode into a sprint when the moment demands. They can leap up to 10 feet high, cover nearly 30 feet in a single bound, and change direction mid-sprint. Whether grazing quietly or launching into a sudden dash, impalas are among Moremi's most adaptable residents.

> As National Park Week wraps up today, let's explore a park in a land sculpted by fire and time—Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island. The Halema'uma'u Crater is an intermittent lava lake in Kīlauea, one of Earth's most active volcanoes. Since it was first documented in 1823, volcanic activity has caused the crater to fill with lava, partially collapse, erupt in fountains of lava, expand to twice its size on two occasions, and at times fill with groundwater. All this activity demonstrates the unpredictable raw power that lies below the surface of the Earth. The natural and cultural importance of this site led to the establishment of Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park in 1916, and to it being named a UNESCO International Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site in the 1980s.

> Step into a world where trees touch the sky. The redwood groves of Redwood National and State Parks (RNSP) in California are home to some of the tallest trees on Earth, soaring over 370 feet high. The combined RNSP contain Redwood National Park, Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park, Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, and Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park. Some of these redwoods were alive when the Mayans built their temples, and the Great Wall of China was under construction. Protected since 1968, the park preserves nearly half of the world's remaining old-growth redwoods.
> 
> Walk through Stout Grove in Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park or Lady Bird Johnson Grove in Redwood National Park for a quiet stroll among the redwoods. You can also hike the Tall Trees Trail, a permit-only path where you can closely witness the tallest trees. The RNSP ecosystem is home to many animals, including Roosevelt elk, black bears, banana slugs, and the endangered marbled murrelets. Ferns and moss thrive beneath the leafy canopy, while coastal fog provides essential moisture to the trees. Whether hiking beneath these towering giants or simply standing in their shadows, the experience is humbling.

> Cute, clumsy, and completely captivating, penguins steal the show today. World Penguin Day is all about celebrating these flightless birds while raising awareness about their habitats. This day originated at McMurdo Station, an American research center on Ross Island in Antarctica, where scientists observed Adélie penguins starting their yearly migration around this time. Inspired by this natural event, the observance was created to shed light on penguins' role in the ecosystem, the threats they face, and the urgency of protecting their habitats.
> 
> Among the many remarkable species of penguins are Magellanic penguins, featured in today's image. A species native to South America's coastal regions, these birds breed along Patagonia's shores in Argentina, Chile, and the Falkland Islands. Named after Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, these medium-sized penguins were first documented in 1520. They can grow up to 30 inches tall and weigh around 15 pounds. Skilled hunters, they thrive on a diet of small fish, squid, and krill, efficiently filtering seawater with their specialized salt-excreting glands. With the abundant marine life along South America's Atlantic coast, they have a reliable food source. While these flightless creatures may not soar in the skies, they certainly capture hearts.

> As National Park Week rolls on, let's turn our attention to Kenai Fjords National Park, a gem on Alaska's Kenai Peninsula. Stretching over 1,000 square miles, this landscape features fjords, river valleys, and alpine landscapes. More than half of the terrain is blanketed in ice. Throughout the 20th century, the park's glaciers have receded, uncovering new land for plant and animal life to take root. From ancient Sitka spruces to delicate fireweed shoots and moss carpeting the forest floor, plant life in Kenai Fjords flourishes. The park is also home to diverse terrestrial and marine mammals, including timber wolves, porcupines, Canadian lynxes, and cetaceans like orcas and fin whales. It also hosts a variety of birds, such as bald eagles and Peale's peregrine falcons.
> 
> Kenai Fjords isn't just about stunning landscapes and flourishing wilderness—it's also a place rich with human history. For thousands of years, Alaska Natives have called this region home, leaving behind traces of their lives in the land. Within the national park, the past still lingers—from the camps left by Alaska Native Sugpiaq people once scattered along the coastline to the remnants of old mining camps in Nuka Bay.

> 'All the world's a stage ...' and only a few have shaped that stage like William Shakespeare. Every April 23, we celebrate Shakespeare Day, honoring one of England's greatest playwrights and poets. This date is special as it marks both his birth and death. Born in 1564, Shakespeare revolutionized English literature with unforgettable works like 'Hamlet,' 'Macbeth,' and 'Romeo and Juliet.' Four centuries after his death, his influence remains undeniable—his stories continue to captivate, challenge, and inspire.
> 
> With today's image, we can step inside Shakespeare's Globe in London, a faithful reconstruction of the original 1599 theater where the Bard's plays once thrilled Elizabethan audiences. The original Globe, built by Shakespeare's acting company, the Lord Chamberlain's Men, was destroyed by fire in 1613 when a cannon misfired during a performance of 'Henry VIII.' With an open-air stage, wooden benches, and a standing 'groundlings' area, the modern Globe is as close as one can get to experiencing Shakespeare's plays as his audience did.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
