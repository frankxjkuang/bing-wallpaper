<summary>Description</summary>

> On September 11, Patriot Day is observed as a national day of service and remembrance to honor the 2,977 people who died in the attacks on the United States in 2001. Congress established the day in 2002 with bipartisan support, and ever since, US government buildings, both domestic and abroad, fly the American flag at half-staff. Many citizens and businesses do the same in remembrance. Patriot Day also honors the hard work and sacrifice of the first responders who bravely put themselves in harm's way in the hours and days after the attacks.

> Today's image is of the Brooklyn Bridge with 'Tribute in Light' in the background, a display of 88 searchlights arranged in two columns that represent the Twin Towers that fell. Originally a temporary display, the annual installation illuminates the sky with columns of light from dusk until dawn. It is a stark reminder of the lives that were tragically lost in Manhattan, Pennsylvania, and at the Pentagon.

> Have you called your nana, abuela, pop-pop or lolo lately? No matter what you call them, there's no better time to pick up the phone than Grandparents' Day, held on the Sunday after Labor Day. Grandparents play a special role in our lives, helping to raise new generations, passing down family history and sharing the wisdom of their experience. Wisdom is not always indicated by a thick Wilford-Brimley-esque mustache, but whiskers do lend a certain esteemed quality. Perhaps that's why these Atlantic walruses look like they're about to tell you why they voted for Hubert Humphrey.

> When the sun sets over Thailand, the Wat Chaiwatthanaram Buddhist temple lights up to welcome the night at the Ayutthaya Historical Park. These ruins are evidence of the area's rich history as the capital of the Ayutthaya Kingdom, which grew in power between the 14th and 18th centuries to rule Siam, or present-day Thailand. Around 1630, Wat Chaiwatthanaram was built on the orders of the dynasty's King Prasat Thong, to symbolize the center of the universe and connote his aspiration to become the future Buddha.
> 
> From the temple, the Historic City of Ayutthaya, a UNESCO World Heritage site, can be reached by boat or road. Three rivers link the once-metropolitan city to the sea. Now a historical ruin, Ayutthaya was an important point of commerce and diplomacy, with its surrounding rivers serving as a natural defense.

> Desert-dwelling camels have been central to lives in the United Arab Emirates for thousands of years. A key mode of transportation for Bedouins, camels long helped them traverse the sweltering sands in search of water and supplies. These dromedaries were also used as currency to fulfill obligations such as dowries or zakat, an annual charitable fee in Muslim communities. Camel milk is a valuable and nutritious ingredient in many recipes in the region, while camel racing keeps people entertained to this day, illustrating the versatility of these hardy creatures.
