> Grand palaces and towering forts shape the landscape of the Indian state of Rajasthan. Among the most prominent is Amber Fort, also known as Amer Fort or Amber Palace, which is perched on a small hill about 7 miles from the main city of Jaipur. Within its regal walls lies the Sattais Katcheri, which means 'court of 27 pillars,' featured in today's image. Amber Fort was built in 1592 and it served as the residence of the maharajas, or rulers, of the area. Famous for its unique blend of Hindu, Rajput, and Mughal architectural styles, it is constructed from pale yellow and pink sandstone alongside white marble. This masterpiece is spread across four levels, each with its own courtyard. Part of the wider Hill Forts of Rajasthan UNESCO World Heritage Site, Amber Fort invites visitors to explore a rich blend of history and royalty.

> Have you ever experienced the awe of seeing an Alaskan moose? The largest moose species, these creatures can weigh 1,400 pounds and reach heights of up to 6 feet at the shoulder. Male moose are called bulls, females are known as cows, and their young are referred to as calves. One thing that really sets moose apart is their incredible antlers, which are only sported by the males.
> 
> Pictured here is a cow in Denali National Park, where around 1,800 moose roam the forested areas near lakes and marshes north of the Alaska Range. Denali's largest herbivores, these mammals feast on willow, birch, and aspen twigs during the winter. When summer rolls around, they enjoy a diverse diet of flowering plants, pond vegetation, and deciduous leaves. While moose aren't usually aggressive, they can turn hostile if bothered by people, dogs, or traffic—especially when they're tired or hungry in winter, struggling through deep snow. Bull moose may also become quite aggressive during mating season in autumn and winter. So, best to admire these giants from a safe distance!

> Today, Antarctica Day shines a spotlight on one of the world's most remarkable international agreements—the Antarctic Treaty. Signed in 1959 by 12 nations, this treaty designated the entire continent as a demilitarized zone, with a special focus on promoting scientific research and collaboration.. This day honors the spirit of global cooperation, reminding us of the collective responsibility to protect the planet's last great wilderness.
> 
> The name 'Antarctica' is derived from the ancient Greek word 'antarktikos,' meaning opposite the Arctic. The concept of an 'Antarctic region' was first mentioned by Greek philosopher Aristotle around 350 BCE. Despite this early reference, it wasn't until the 19th century that humans actually laid eyes on Antarctica. It is the coldest, driest, and windiest of the Earth's continents, with temperatures plunging as low as -112 degrees Fahrenheit. Vast ice sheets and glaciers found here hold about 70% of the world's fresh water. The waters are dotted with icebergs, as seen in today's image, which drift across the Southern Ocean and gradually melt over time. Species like Emperor and Adélie penguins, along with seals, mites, roundworms, and moss piglets, have made this icy habitat their permanent home.

> Put on your tartan and let the bagpipes play—it's St. Andrew's Day! Scotland's national day is a public holiday there—though not everyone takes the day off. A fisherman by trade, St. Andrew—also the patron saint of several other countries including Greece, Barbados, Romania, and Ukraine—was one of the 12 apostles and a key figure in Christianity. Though he never set foot in Scotland, his influence is immortalized in the country's flag, a white saltire on a blue background, said to represent the cross on which he was martyred.
> 
> Festivities on St. Andrew's Day range from traditional folk music to high-spirited cèilidhs—social gatherings that involve music, dancing, and storytelling. Food plays a central role in celebrations, too. Expect hearty servings of Scottish staples like haggis, neeps and tatties (mashed rutabaga and potatoes), smoked salmon, and oatcakes. The day also serves as a warm-up to Scotland's winter festivals, leading into Christmas, Hogmanay, and Burns Night. To mark this day, we're visiting Kilchurn Castle, a historic landmark in the Scottish Highlands. Perched on the banks of Loch Awe, the fortress was built in the mid-15th century by Sir Colin Campbell. Though this castle now stands in ruins, it still offers a glimpse into the country's medieval past and the powerful Clan Campbell.

<summary>Description</summary>

> A tidal marvel and a slice of medieval life all rolled into one rocky outcrop—welcome to Mont-Saint-Michel in Normandy, northern France. The story of this 'Wonder of the West' goes back to the early 8th century, when Archangel Michael was said to have appeared to the bishop of Avranches in a vision. The divine message was clear: build a sanctuary on this rock. Taking this angelic advice seriously, the bishop laid the foundations of what would eventually become the abbey that dominates the island today. Over the centuries, this UNESCO World Heritage Site grew in size and reputation, attracting monks, pilgrims, and invaders alike.
> 
> One of the things that makes Mont-Saint-Michel such a striking place is its dramatic tidal range. When the tide is low, you can stroll across the sandy flats and approach the island on foot. But when the tide rushes in, the sea encircles the mount, turning it back into an island that can only be reached over a bridge. It's easy to see why it attracts over 3 million visitors a year.

> Today, many Americans will spend time with friends and family, giving thanks and enjoying what some consider to be the best meal of the year. The tradition dates back to English colonists who celebrated the first Thanksgiving in Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1621. Their treacherous journey from England the year before and their first winter claimed half of the colonists, and the rest might have died too if not for the generosity of the Wampanoag people. To celebrate their first corn harvest and thank the Native Americans who helped them, the colonists held a three-day feast.
> 
> The centerpiece of today's feast for many will be the turkey, which wasn't part of early celebrations. Turkey only became a tradition in the mid-1800s after President Abraham Lincoln and writer Sarah Hale popularized the holiday and meal as a way to heal post-Civil War America. Wild turkeys like the toms (males) seen in today's image are native to North America, where they have been evolving for 20 million years. Hunted to near extinction in the 19th century, the wild turkey population has rebounded to more than 7 million birds today, thanks to conservation programs.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Tombeau du Géant in Bouillon, Belgium, offers a picturesque panorama for those who make the journey to see it. The Giant's Tomb, as the hill is known in English, resembles a giant resting in the crook of the 130-mile-long Semois River. The name originates from a local legend about a Gallic giant, Treviso, who chose to leap off the cliffs of Rocher des Gattes rather than be captured by Roman soldiers. This vantage point, popular among hikers and road-trippers, provides a view that shifts dramatically with the seasons. During autumn, the landscape dons warm colors, as seen in today's image, making it an ideal spot for nature enthusiasts and photographers.
> 
> While here, you might want to visit Bouillon, a town that invites you to step back in time. It's famous for its medieval castle, Château de Bouillon, once home to Godfrey of Bouillon, a leader of the First Crusade. Visitors can explore the tunnels and towers of the castle, imagining what life was like during the Middle Ages.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
