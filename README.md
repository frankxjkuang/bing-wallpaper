<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to Iguazu Falls, the largest waterfall system in the world. The name 'Iguazu' has its origins in the regional languages Guarani or Tupi, meaning 'big water.' These epic waterfalls are formed by the Iguazu River, on the border of Argentina's Misiones province and Brazil's Paraná state.
> 
> The Iguazu Falls have long attracted admirers. Spanish explorer Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca is thought to have been the first European to see them in 1541. In 1907, businessman Domingo Ayarragaray saw their potential and built a hotel and roads nearby. The falls became such a sensation that they were designated as national parks in both countries—Argentina's Iguazu National Park in 1934 and Brazil's Iguaçu National Park in 1939. UNESCO made the parks World Heritage Sites in 1984 and 1986, respectively. Surrounded by the rainforest, the falls are made up of hundreds of cascades and channels carved over millions of years by the Iguazu River, the tallest of which is the U-shaped Devil's Throat, at 269 feet high.

> 'Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope.' These words by former UN chief Kofi Annan capture the essence of International Literacy Day, celebrated every September 8. Established by UNESCO in 1966, it promotes the importance of literacy as a matter of dignity and a human right. The UN estimates that at least 765 million adults worldwide cannot read and write, and millions of children are failing to learn basic literacy skills. We are marking the day with an image of the Stockholm Public Library in Sweden, or 'Stadsbiblioteket' as it is known to locals.
> 
> Here, more than 2 million volumes wait to unfold stories in over 100 languages. Designed by architect Erik Gunnar Asplund in the 1920s, the building is a towering cylinder inside a cube. The main lending library, pictured, is in the round room at the center, inviting readers into a literal circle of knowledge. On this day, let's join in a collective turning of pages in the pursuit of greater knowledge for all and creating a fairer and more literate society.

<summary>Description</summary>

> On the first Saturday in September, National Hummingbird Day celebrates these tiny, agile birds and their role as pollinators in our ecosystem. Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed; they can flap their wings up to 80 times per second, allowing them to hover and fly backward. Their high metabolism requires them to eat constantly, so they spend their days flitting from flower to flower, sipping nectar and catching insects. These birds can remember which flowers they've visited and how long they will take to refill with nectar.
> 
> Let's meet the Anna's hummingbird, seen in today's image. Named after Anna Masséna, Duchess of Rivoli, it's one of an estimated 366 hummingbird species, and it's among the most common hummingbirds on North America's west coast. With its shimmering emerald feathers and sparkling rose-pink throat, this little bird is a sight to behold. So, today, let's spread our wings of awareness and protect these birds—one garden at a time.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This storybook setting is Glenariff Forest Park in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, which spans nearly 3,000 acres of woodland and waterfalls. Among its popular walking trails is the Waterfall Walkway, a 3-mile trail that passes through a national nature reserve and past the Ess-na-Crub and Ess-na-Larach waterfalls. Glenariff is home to a rich diversity of wildlife including red squirrels, pine martens, and badgers. Birdwatchers will be delighted by willow warblers, chiffchaffs, and kingfishers. The flora is just as impressive, with trees like the old beech pictured here, oaks, birches, and rowans creating a lush canopy. It's the perfect spot for a bit of soul-searching beneath ancient branches in this beautiful landscape known as the 'Queen of the Glens.'

<summary>Description</summary>

> As daylight fades, dusky eagle-owls, the silent hunters seen in today's image, emerge from their nests. These primarily nocturnal raptors were snapped in Pakistan and can be found in the forests and scrublands across South and Southeast Asia. An impressive wingspan of 15–17 inches, piercing yellow eyes, and exceptional hearing help them to catch small mammals and birds with precision in dim light. Measuring up to 2 feet tall, these feathered predators can also be spotted hunting in the daytime when the weather is cloudy. They often live in the abandoned nests of other birds or in natural crevices. Dusky eagle-owls breed in December and January, usually rearing their young in the safety of tall trees or cliff ledges. Nature lovers and bird watchers are captivated by their solemn gaze and elegant stature.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Sometimes it's nice to get away. Thanks to environmentalist Howard Zahniser, Americans can do that in one of the country's many wildernesses—sheltered from human activities. While the protection of national forests and parks began in the late 1800s, untamed wilderness had dwindled to only 2.5% of US land by the 1960s. To reverse this trend, Zahniser wrote most of what became the Wilderness Act. Signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson on September 3, 1964, today it protects more than 109 million acres—5% of the land in the US.
> 
> Pictured in today's image, Crystal Lake, in the Enchantments, Washington, is in one such protected area. Located in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, the Enchantments region has more than 700 lakes and ponds and some of the best rock climbing in the Western US. It's also home to mountain goats, ptarmigan, pikas, and many alpine flowers. If you want to see Alpine Lakes Wilderness yourself, however, be prepared to wait. Few permits are granted for day hikes, and of the 40,000 people who entered last year's lottery for overnight permits, only 2,558 received one.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
