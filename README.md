<summary>Description</summary>

> Some towns live in the present. Miravet in Spain politely declined. Clinging to a cliff above the River Ebro, this Catalan village offers a living glimpse into the Middle Ages. A castle keeps its perch, potters spin like it's the 1300s, and the local ferry still refuses to join the motor age. Welcome to the village where even the river seems too relaxed to rush. As Spain's longest river, the Ebro winds through tales of Iberians, Romans, Moors, and Knights Templar. Locals once relied on its waters for trade, transport, and even defense. Today, you'll spot kayakers, ferry boats, and visitors drifting through the same currents where Crusaders once crossed.
> 
> Perched above the village, the Miravet Castle dates to the 12th century. Built by the Moors and later fortified by the French military order Knights Templar, this fortress was made to last. Thick walls, strategic towers, and a commanding view of the river made sure of that. With a population of less than 700, the village is a quiet maze of stone houses and narrow lanes, built to confuse invaders and, coincidentally, modern tourists. There's a former Jewish quarter, viewpoints that deliver postcard-worthy angles, and plenty of silence—broken only by birds, bells, and the occasional clay jug clinking into place.

> They slip through the water like furry torpedoes, roll on riverbanks like children on a playground, and hold hands while they nap. Otters are nature's playful pranksters, but their future isn't all smooth sailing. Many species are threatened by habitat destruction, pollution, and illegal wildlife trade. But it doesn't have to be that way. On World Otter Day—the last Wednesday of May—let's shine a light on the challenges these lovable mammals face and help protect their place in the wild.
> 
> Otters belong to the Mustelidae family, a diverse group that includes weasels, badgers, and minks, and are found on every continent except Australia and Antarctica. With 13 species worldwide, including the European otter, giant otter, and sea otter—pictured here—these semi-aquatic animals are adapted for life in water. Their webbed feet, dense fur, and strong tails make them excellent swimmers. Beyond their cuteness, otters play a vital role in ecosystems. As top predators in freshwater and coastal habitats, they help maintain healthy fish populations and keep aquatic environments balanced. Without otters, food chains could become unstable, leading to ecological problems. Whether it's through education, conservation efforts, or simply spreading the word, every action helps keep them afloat.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Ever wanted to swim in the ocean without accidentally drinking half of it? Enter Mona Vale Rockpool in Sydney, Australia—a watery paradox where the ocean is wild beyond the walls and well-behaved within its calm, contained edges. Perched in Sydney's Northern Beaches area—this rock pool feels more like a natural wonder than a human-made one. Built in the 1930s during the Depression, it was carved out of a natural rock shelf as part of an unemployment relief scheme. Upgraded over time, the pool is nearly 100 feet long and flanked by a smaller children's pool. The pools are free, open year-round, and cleaned regularly by both council crews and the ocean itself. So next time you are in Sydney, make a splash where the waves meet the wall. It's a shore thing.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we're honoring Americans who gave their lives in military service. Originally known as Decoration Day, the tradition began in the late 1860s after the American Civil War. Communities held springtime tributes by decorating the graves of fallen Union soldiers with flowers. Over time, it expanded to commemorate all US military personnel who died in wars. Locals observe the day with ceremonies and parades across the country.
> 
> One of the most powerful symbols of this remembrance is Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. The cemetery was established during the American Civil War on the grounds of Confederate General Robert E. Lee's former estate. The Union Army started burying its dead at Arlington in 1864, turning the land into a national cemetery. Currently more than 400,000 veterans and eligible family members are buried here. One of the most-visited sites in the cemetery is the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, guarded 24/7 since 1937. It honors three unidentified service members with a solemn changing of the guard ceremony. Notable graves in the cemetery include former presidents William Howard Taft and John F. Kennedy. Spanning over 600 acres, it continues to hold funeral services every weekday.

<summary>Description</summary>

> What was a depleted quarry over a century ago now transforms into a living color wheel each spring. Butchart Gardens in Brentwood Bay, British Columbia, knows how to put on a bloom show. In spring, roses scent the air, tulips line the paths, and something new blooms around every turn. But it didn't always look this way. In the early 1900s, Robert Pim Butchart operated a limestone quarry here. His wife, Jennie, saw potential in the depleted pit and began planting flowers in 1904. Now spread across 55 acres, the garden is home to more than 900 plant species—and each spring, almost 300,000 bulbs bloom.
> 
> While visiting the Butchart Gardens, take a stroll through the Sunken Garden, site of the former quarry, and explore the Japanese Garden, designed in 1906 by landscape architect Isaburo Kishida. If you stop by the Rose Garden, be sure to check out the Italian Garden—it replaced the family's tennis courts. There's more: ride the Rose Carousel, which comprises 30 hand-carved wooden animals. You'll also find quiet swings and bronze statues like the Three Sturgeons Fountain. Wrap it up with seasonal dishes or afternoon tea at the on-site dining room.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today, European Day of Parks celebrates the national parks and conservation areas that shape a country's natural identity. Created by the EUROPARC Federation in 1999, this day commemorates the founding of Europe's first national parks—a set of nine parks established in Sweden in 1909. It promotes efforts to protect natural habitats, wildlife, and cultural heritage while encouraging sustainable tourism and outdoor activities.
> 
> Jotunheimen National Park in Norway is a prime example of protected natural landscapes. Established in 1980, it covers over 400 square miles of mountains, glaciers, and deep valleys. It is home to the country's highest peaks, including Galdhøpiggen, the highest in Northern Europe at 8,100 feet. The name 'Jotunheimen' translates to 'Home of the Giants,' a nod to its dramatic terrain and Norse mythology. The park shelters red foxes, Arctic foxes, lemmings, and red deer, while its flora includes hardy alpine species adapted to extreme conditions. The Gjende lake is famous for its striking green color, caused by glacial sediments. Stretching about 11 miles in length and less than a mile at its widest point, the lake sits at around 3,280 feet above sea level. It's the launch point for the famous Besseggen hike—which attracts thousands each year—made famous by Henrik Ibsen's play 'Peer Gynt.'

> No need to hurry, because today marks the 25th anniversary of World Turtle Day. The American Tortoise Rescue (ATR) established World Turtle Day to raise awareness and conservation efforts. ATR has helped rehabilitate, rescue, and rehome thousands of turtles and tortoises, working to protect them and their disappearing habitats.
> 
> Here we see a fascinating phenomenon—a Julia butterfly on the nose of a yellow-spotted river turtle in Ecuador's Amazon River region. Butterflies in the Amazon are known to sip the tears of turtles, which provide a vital source of sodium, a mineral in short supply. The yellow-spotted river turtle is one of the largest river turtles in South America. While these turtles are well-adapted to water, they face a range of threats from humans and a variety of animals. In the 1960s, they were heavily exploited for the American pet trade, leading to strict regulations on their importation. Today, a self-sustaining population exists in the US, with some living over 30 years in captivity.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
