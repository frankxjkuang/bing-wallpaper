<summary>Description</summary>

> Huddled beneath these pink-gray stone monoliths is the pretty village of Agüero, in Huesca province, northern Spain. The textured cliffs known as the Mallos de Agüero act as a 660-foot-high backdrop to this picturesque village, drawing both climbers and photographers keen on capturing the perfect shot. This hidden gem in the foothills of the Pyrenees has about 130 residents and is popular with tourists, thanks to the 12th-century Church of Santiago. A national monument with intricate stone carvings of beasts and religious scenes, the church was never finished but is considered one of this region's most beautiful Romanesque temples. If you consider yourself a history buff, a rock climber, or both, put Agüero on your travel list.

> Today we're observing Pi Day with a bird's-eye view of the hedge maze at Cyherbia Botanical Park near Ayia Napa in Cyprus. It's the day we celebrate the mathematical constant π. Today's date, March 14, was chosen because when expressed numerically, it matches the first three digits of pi: 3.14. You remember pi from geometry class—it's the ratio of the distance around a circle to the distance across it. Pi is used to compute a circle's area and circumference. The circular labyrinth at the Cyherbia Botanical Park brings the ratio to life and is a must-visit for people who love to solve puzzles. If you're ready for a challenge, give it a go.

> It's tiring losing that hour of sleep as the clocks 'spring forward,' so let's relax for a while with these champion nappers, in Tanzania's Serengeti National Park. One of the most spectacular wildlife ecosystems on the planet, the park is home to rhinos, leopards, elephants, giraffes—and a huge lion population. The grassland here is dotted with rock formations that stick out like islands, the largest of which, the simba kopjes, are popular hangouts for lions and are said to have inspired Pride Rock in 'The Lion King.' In the heat of the Serengeti, lush trees provide the perfect shelter for lions to take a nap and reenergize. We hope you are as cozy as you curl up and recuperate on National Napping Day.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The Lucian Blaga National Theater, in the Romanian city of Cluj-Napoca, is a cultural icon. Built between 1904 and 1906, it was designed by the famous Austrian architects Ferdinand Fellner and Hermann Helmer in the Neo-Baroque style, popular in the late 19th century. This opulent style nodded back to the grandiosity of the Baroque movement, which began in Rome in the 1600s and flourished across Europe. The building houses both the national theater and the Romanian Opera and plays host to a wide array of cultural events here in Romania's second-largest city.

> Lit by bright New England sunshine, the salt-tolerant grass growing here really stands out against the turquoise sea water lapping against it. Salt marshes are important coastal wetlands that protect shorelines from erosion, are major contributors to the aquatic food web, and provide nurseries for birds, fish, and other wildlife.

Tourists frequenting the tranquil summer vacation spot enjoy freshly caught seafood, stunning beaches, museums, and boating. Though Gloucester may have a sleepy, small-town feel, it's only 45 minutes away from Boston. Oh, and it's pronounced 'Glosster' unless you're from Massachusetts—then it's 'Glosstah.'

<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to the Vale of Edale, home to a small village which marks the starting point of one of the UK's most famous long-distance walks. Edale is one of many dales—or wide valleys—of England's Peak District National Park, a picturesque area where heather moorland and rocky gritstone landscapes sit side-by-side with rolling uplands. From here, walkers set out on the hilly and remote Pennine Way, covering 268 miles along England's wildest landscapes up to the Scottish Borders. But if you don't want to hike that far, excellent walking country surrounds the village itself, which lies to the south of the Peak District's highest point, Kinder Scout.
> 
> Edale is home to about 350 people but while it might look remote, it is easily accessible by train from the nearby cities of Manchester and Sheffield. Its tiny station handles crowds of visitors every year, keen to explore the picturesque hamlets and rolling countryside.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> The water pictured crashing down the side of Waimea Canyon, on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, has come from one of the rainiest places on Earth. Waipo'o Falls is fed by water from Mount Wai'ale'ale, a shield volcano whose name means 'overflowing water.' The mountain is often shrouded in clouds and experiences a huge amount of rainfall each year—which helps explains those spectacular rainbows.
> 
> Waimea Canyon is sometimes referred to as the Grand Canyon of the Pacific and while it is considerably smaller than its more famous cousin, it has no shortage of stunning views of crested buttes, deep gorges, and flowing falls. So, if you want to see the true variety of Kauai, leave the beach behind and take the winding Route 550 into the mountains for stunning views of the shore and canyon, before arriving at the lookout to enjoy the best view of Waipo'o Falls. Ideally under a spectacular rainbow.
