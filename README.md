> From glaciers and waterfalls to volcanoes and black sand beaches, Iceland's Snæfellsnes peninsula has 'GoT' it all. Pictured here is the 1,519-foot-high Kirkjufell, a hill often called 'Church Mountain,' as it is said to resemble a steeple. In fact, it is a nunatak, a rock formation that protrudes through an ice sheet or glacier. You might recognize it from the 'Game of Thrones' series, where it featured in a scene set north of the colossal ice wall. When it's not starring on TV, it is popular with photographers thanks to its unusual shape, coastal location, and colors that shift with the seasons. And if you're lucky, and the weather conditions align, Kirkjufell offers a magnificent view of the northern lights.

> The holiday season isn't quite over! December 26 marks Boxing Day—a popular day to get outside and enjoy a walk after a day of indulgence. Our homepage image shows a wintry sunrise over fields near the village of Dedham, in Colchester, England¬—perfect walking country.
> 
> Boxing Day is observed in the UK and some other countries including Canada and Australia. It's thought to have originated from the old British tradition of giving boxes filled with presents to servants on the day after Christmas. These days, Boxing Day is often associated with sporting events. It’s a big day for soccer in the UK and horse races are held across the country, including the historic King George VI Chase at Kempton Park Racecourse. Meanwhile in Canada, ice hockey fans gather to cheer on their favorite teams. Just like winter sunshine, the holiday season ends sooner than you think, so make the most of it!

<summary>Description</summary>

> Dashing through the snow on our homepage today, reindeer, or caribou as they are known here in North America, have been synonymous with Christmas for two centuries. American writer Clement Clarke Moore is credited with popularizing them as Santa's helpers in the poem 'A Visit from St. Nicholas,' first published in 1823. And no wonder Santa picked them. With two layers of fur and eyes that adapt to the Arctic's shifting light levels, reindeer are very versatile. You likely won't see them fly, but you might find a herd migrating from tundra to forest in the North Polar Region, North America, Northern Europe, or Siberia. Their hooves can expand or shrink according to ground conditions, keeping their heavy frame stable on soft ground in summer, ice in winter, and steep rooftops at Christmas. If you're celebrating Christmas today, we wish you a merry one.

> Family time during the holidays isn't always harmonious. Sometimes you might be tempted to channel this chinstrap penguin and give your nearest and dearest an earful. If you need a break from all the seasonal joy, Festivus might be the holiday for you. The idea was popularized in a 'Seinfeld' episode, which detailed the Costanza family's December 23 traditions, including putting up an unadorned aluminum Festivus pole and airing their year-end personal grievances. Since the episode debuted in 1997, Festivus has taken on a life of its own both among fans and people looking for an alternative way to celebrate the season. While most embrace the trappings of the holiday season, Festivus is for the rest of us.

<summary>Description</summary>

> What a lovely city! The Slavic word 'ljub' means 'to love,' and it's right there in the name of Slovenia's capital city, Ljubljana, and the Ljubljanica River that runs through it. This relatively small capital, with a population of just under 300,000, grew up on a trade route connecting the northern Adriatic Sea and the Danube region. While modern buildings skirt the city's periphery, its core preserves historic structures, some of which date back to ancient Rome. The Ljubljana Castle, pictured in the center of today's homepage image, has towered over the city for 900 years. Other sights include the Triple Bridge, the Dragon Bridge, and the historic Old Town. Keep an eye out while you stroll around; you might encounter the city's symbol, the Ljubljana Dragon.

> Frost-covered birch trees add a graceful touch to this winter landscape in the German state of Bavaria. This region is home to the villages of Uffing and Schöffau, on the shores of Staffelsee lake, and is often covered in mist and snow, creating an ethereal ambience. A winter chill is to be expected today, on the shortest day of the year. Typically falling on December 21, the solstice marks the beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere. While we're wrapping up warm, the Southern Hemisphere is celebrating the start of summer on their longest day of the year.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
