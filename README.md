<summary>Description</summary>

> Freedom is not free, and nobody understands that better than veterans. Today, America honors its military men and women for their service. The holiday originally celebrated a temporary halt in fighting between Allied nations and Germany during World War I—the official end of the war came the following year in 1919. Armistice Day, as it was later named, commemorated this respite, and it became a federal holiday in 1938. A few years later, America fought in World War II, and later, the Korean War. As a result, Congress amended the holiday in 1954, exchanging the word 'Armistice' with 'Veterans' to include veterans of all the country's wars.

Also known as 'The Forgotten War,' the three-year conflict began in 1950 and was one of America's most hard-fought wars. Near the National Mall, the Korean War Veterans Memorial honors the tens of thousands of US service personnel who died or went missing and more than 100,000 soldiers who were wounded.

> Ever seen a group of flamingos take to the skies? If you have, there's a good chance they were Caribbean flamingos, also known as American flamingos, as seen in Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico, in today's image. Flamingos are referred to as a flamboyance when in a group, but they can also be called a stand, colony, or pat. The Caribbean flamingo is the largest flamingo species in the Americas and the only one native to North America. These vibrant birds are typically found around brackish and saltwater areas, like marshes, estuaries, and along coastlines. Because of their pink color, they're often confused with roseate spoonbills. However, their long necks and bent bills distinguish them from other wading birds like the great blue heron and wood stork.
> 
> Found across regions like the southeastern United States, northern South America, the Galápagos Islands, and Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula, Caribbean flamingos are well adapted for short migrations in search of food. Using long legs and webbed feet, they hunt shallow waters for shrimp, crustaceans, mollusks, fish, and algae. Their habitats are increasingly threatened by coastal development, pollution, and rising sea levels, putting their population at risk. Yet, Caribbean flamingos still amaze us when they soar gracefully through the skies.

> Get ready for a starry Moroccan night! Stargazing here is truly magical, as the vast skies and minimal light pollution transform each evening into a dazzling display. Every star you see is part of our galaxy, the Milky Way, which appears as a creamy band of light in the darkest skies. In today's image, you can see this cosmic beauty glowing over Aït Benhaddou, a historic fortified village known as a ksar, in the Ouarzazate province of Morocco. This site was first fortified in the 11th century. It was a key stop on the ancient caravan trade route connecting the Sahara and the city of Marrakesh. Perched on a hillside by the Ounila River, this village is a cluster of buildings encircled by a protective wall, complete with towers and a gate.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Iceland's glacial rivers have shaped the landscape here in the land of fire and ice over thousands of years. The rivers seen in today's image are formed from the meltwater of vast glaciers like Vatnajökull, Langjökull, and Hofsjökull. Vatnajökull, the largest ice cap in Iceland, covers over 3,000 square miles—approximately 10% of the country's landmass. As the glaciers melt, the water carries fine sediments, creating a braided river system with a milky appearance that contrasts with the earthy tones of the volcanic terrain. Every spring and summer, the rivers swell with seasonal meltwater, continually shaping and reshaping the land. Aerial views reveal their intricate patterns, interwoven across the terrain toward the North Atlantic Ocean. The water also powers hydroelectric power stations, reinforcing Iceland's status as a leader in sustainable energy.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Amidst the mist-covered cedars and Sitka spruces of Canada's Great Bear Rainforest, the Vancouver Coastal Sea wolf roams free. These canines thrive in this ecosystem in British Columbia, which stretches from the north of Vancouver Island to the Alaskan border. This unique subspecies of the gray wolf is specific to the region and leads a semi-aquatic lifestyle, swimming between islands in search of food. Unlike other wolf species, they have a marine-based diet, consisting of fish, clams, mussels, crabs, otters, and seals. These animals live in packs, communicating with each other through growls, barks, and whines, so they're often heard before they are seen.

> Olympic National Park, established in 1938, offers an escape into unspoiled wilderness. It covers nearly 1,440 square miles on Washington's Olympic Peninsula. With a labyrinth of ecosystems that range from glacier-capped mountains to temperate rainforests, the park is a home for wildlife and an International Biosphere Reserve. Within it lies Shi Shi Beach, a serene stretch where the Pacific laps against sea stacks and sandy shores, as seen in today's image.
> 
> From here, you can follow one of the park's many trails and trek along the coast to see the beach's sea arch at Point of the Arches, an outcrop that has over 30 sea stacks, columns of rock rising from the beach. Within the park, visitors can get a closer look at Mount Olympus, spot over 300 bird species like red-breasted nuthatches, winter wrens, and spotted owls. They can also take a refreshing swim in Lake Crescent. The coastal wilderness area north of Cape Alava, including Shi Shi Beach, has been home to the Makah Tribe of the Pacific Northwest Coast for over 2,000 years. Visitors can gain an insight into their culture at the nearby Makah Reservation.

> It's time to get out and vote! In 1845, Congress designated the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November as the day Americans vote for most federal offices. Prior to this, states held elections on a date of their choosing within about a month of early December, which created issues with early and late elections. For convenience and to save money, many elections for state and local offices are also held on Election Day.
> 
> At the heart of this process is Washington DC, seat of the US federal government. Pictured here today is the National Mall, a landscaped park in the capital that is affectionately known as America's Front Yard. Within the National Mall lie some of the country's most famous museums and monuments, including the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, and the Smithsonian Institution. It also serves as a symbolic and physical link between two of the branches of government, connecting the Capitol building—home of the legislature—to the White House, headquarters of the executive branch. The US Supreme Court, representing the judiciary, sits at the eastern end of the National Mall.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
