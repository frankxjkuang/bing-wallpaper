> We're used to Santa Claus sliding down chimneys, but who knew he could ski? Thousands of Santa Clauses make a stunning downhill display to open the ski season in Verbier, Switzerland, each year. Why the costumes? Their annual descent also celebrates the feast day of Saint Nicholas, observed in Europe on December 5 and in the US on December 6.
> 
> Little is known historically of Saint Nicholas, but he's thought to have grown up under the Roman Empire, in a wealthy Greek family in what's now southern Turkey. When his parents died, he used his inheritance to help those in need, the sick, and the suffering—even tossing gifts through strangers' open windows (not chimneys) now and then. Nicholas   joined the early Christian clergy as a bishop, dedicating his life to serving others generously. It's said he loved and helped children especially, and that, of course, is at the root of the legend of Santa Claus.

> We're taking a walk with these beautiful beasts for World Wildlife Conservation Day. Tanzania's Mount Kilimanjaro, known as the Great White Mountain to local tribes, stands sentinel as these African bush elephants cross the vast savannahs of Amboseli National Park in Kenya. Habitat loss and poaching for ivory have decimated the populations of the bush elephant and its cousin the forest elephant, which roams the nearby foothills of Kilimanjaro.
> 
> Today is an occasion to recognize our planet's fragile ecosystem and the daily impact humans have on biodiversity. It's up to all of us to help these elephants keep roaming.

> Every December the center of the art world convenes not in New York, Tokyo, or London, but in a town known more for its wide sandy beaches, café Cubano, and conga rhythms. Art Basel Miami Beach, which wraps up its three-day run today, is the American leg of an international art fair also staged in Basel, Switzerland (where the festival started in 1970), Hong Kong, and Paris. The event, now 20 years old, is the most comprehensive contemporary art fair in North America, attracting thousands of artists, dealers, collectors, appreciators, and just fun-seeking tourists for this annual burst of creativity steps from the sand.

<summary>Description</summary>

> On this day in 1980, the single largest expansion of protected lands in history doubled the size of the US National Park System. As a result, Alaska now has eight national parks, plus numerous monuments and preserves that protect more than 157 million total acres. When President Jimmy Carter signed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, the public was granted the right to appreciate stunning locations like the one in today's photo: the braided river delta of the 51-mile-long Tlikakila River in Lake Clark National Park.
> 
> In the native Athabaskan language, Tlikakila literally means 'salmon are there river.' The park is known for its salmon-laden waterways and the fish are of major importance to the local economy and ecosystem. Local bear populations benefit from the excess salmon, and bear watching is very popular at Lake Clark. The abundance of salmon has also benefited a wolf pack within the park—the only one in the world known to be solely dependent on salmon.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The most isolated continent in the world is hands down the polar desert that is Antarctica, the coldest, driest, and windiest continent on Earth. Inhospitable as it sounds, Antarctica, which lies almost completely below the Antarctic Circle, is also a place of stunning beauty as evidenced by this image of Paradise Harbour, aka Paradise Bay, near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. Antarctica is also extraordinarily vulnerable to the effects of climate change, worth remembering today on Antarctica Day, which marks the anniversary of the signing of the 1959 Antarctic Treaty. The international agreement protects Antarctica as a scientific preserve.
> 
> The Antarctic Peninsula is the northernmost part of Antarctica and the closest to South America, making it relatively accessible. Paradise Harbour is one of the most-visited places on the continent, and a regular stop for cruise ships. The area is home to a thriving colony of penguins and is an excellent place to see glacial calving. While the loss of glacial ice is normal, the process has accelerated at an alarming rate due to global warming. The mile-thick ice sheet that covers Antarctica accounts for 70% of the planet's supply of fresh water. To put that in perspective, if it all melted, sea levels would rise by 200 feet. Without this land of ice, the world would look a lot different.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Beautiful, historic Rovinj dips into the Adriatic like a toe testing the water. The 200-foot-tall bell tower of the Church of St. Euphemia overlooks Rovinj's historic center. The church, which was built in the early 1700s over the remains of older Christian holy structures, acts as a beacon that welcomes home the town's fleet of fishing boats each evening.
> 
> More than 2,000 years old, Rovinj was once an island—it wasn't connected to the mainland until 1763, when the narrow channel was filled in. Today the city's economy comes from tourism, and the romantic cobblestone streets are home to numerous bars, restaurants, and museums. It's on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites and is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Istria.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The largest heron in North America, the great blue heron makes its nest in a 'basket' made from twigs, usually placed high in a tree. The herons line the interior with moss, leaves, grass, and other softer materials, and tend to return to the same nesting site each year, though not the same nest. The male heron finds building materials while the female assembles the nest, then both birds maintain and add to it. The helpful male heron shown here is presenting his mate with nesting material—he seems an apt mascot for this year's Giving Tuesday.
> 
> Always observed on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving in the US, Giving Tuesday began in 2012. It has since spread around the globe, as other countries have embraced the idea. The purpose of the observance is to encourage everyone to set aside some time to do something good for others. So this year, after you've finished your shopping, think about contributing to your favorite nonprofit, giving to someone in need, or just helping someone build their nest.
