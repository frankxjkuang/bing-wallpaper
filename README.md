<summary>Description</summary>

> Set at Corsica's southern edge, Bonifacio looks out across a narrow strait to Sardinia, its limestone cliffs towering above the waves. Bonifacio didn't begin as a picturesque tourist destination—it was originally established as a coastal fortification and has spent centuries guarding one of the Mediterranean's busiest sea lanes. Established in 828 CE by Boniface II of Tuscany, the commune gradually became a meeting point for traders, soldiers, and sailors—each group contributing to the evolution of the town's structure. Bonifacio is divided into two sections, with the 'vieille ville' (old town)—also known as 'la Haute Ville' (the Upper City)—standing on a high cliff within the original citadel walls. Below, the marine area lines the narrow inlet with harbors, waterfront homes, and a growing valley community.
> 
> While here, the Bonifacio Citadel is a must-see. First built in the 9th century and expanded over time, it invites visitors to wander through quiet passageways, old military buildings, and cobblestone streets. Nearby, you can explore the Marine Cemetery, climb the King of Aragon's Stairway, and visit the Bastion de l'Étendard, now home to a small museum.

> Planes, progress, and a whole lot of sky. National Aviation Day gives us a reason to pause and appreciate how aviation has shaped the modern world—and the innovators who dared to dream of flight. The national day was established in 1939 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to honor Orville Wright's contributions to aviation. Wright, born on this day in 1871, achieved the first powered, controlled flight in 1903 along with his brother Wilbur. The day is recognized as an opportunity to promote the advancement of aviation through public events and educational activities. Many aviation museums offer free or discounted entry, and airfields often hold open houses to engage the community.
> 
> The Solar Impulse project is a remarkable milestone in modern aviation. In July 2010, the Solar Impulse prototype completed a 26-hour test flight powered only by the sun. It flew through the day and night without using fuel—a key step in proving solar-powered flight was possible. Building on this, Solar Impulse 2, seen in today's image, successfully completed the first solar-powered flight around the world from 2015 to 2016, covering over 26,000 miles without burning fossil fuels. These flights show how aviation can push forward into cleaner, more sustainable territory.

<summary>Description</summary>

> There's no easing into the wild here—the Avalanche Lake Trail carves a bold path through rock scrambles, narrow ledges, and alpine serenity. Tucked away in New York's Adirondack High Peaks, this 9-acre alpine lake sits at nearly 2,900 feet between Mount Colden and Avalanche Mountain. Shaped by ancient glaciers, the lake is framed by dramatic cliffs and rugged terrain that echo its icy origins. Its most striking feature is the Trap Dike—a towering 1,200-foot rock canyon flanked by steep walls, making the lake one of the most awe-inspiring sights in the Adirondacks. Massive avalanches carved these cliffs, leaving behind the dramatic landscape that gave Avalanche Lake its name. The Avalanche Lake Trail begins at the Adirondack Loj, a well-known launch point for adventures in the High Peaks. Spanning about 9.6 miles round trip with a 1,350-foot elevation gain, the hike may seem manageable on paper—but it's the uneven terrain that truly tests your mettle.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Built to brave storms and steer ships to safety, lighthouses now glow as symbols of heritage, wonder, and connection. Each year on the third weekend of August, the International Lighthouse Lightship Weekend brings together people from around the globe to celebrate these coastal icons. The event was launched in 1998 by John Forsyth and Mike Dalrymple of Scotland's Ayr Amateur Radio Group. It aims to raise awareness about preserving lighthouses and lightships while also promoting amateur radio and encouraging international goodwill.
> 
> Among the many lighthouses that carry this legacy forward is the Lyngvig Lighthouse in Denmark, featured here. Standing over 120 feet tall, this tower was built in 1906 atop a 55-foot dune along the west coast of Jutland—the country's westernmost region. Made with a concrete foundation and brick walls, and finished with teak-framed windows and doors, the lighthouse originally required a team of three keepers. They maintained its light until 1965. It has been operating automatically ever since. Following a temporary closure in 2024 due to structural concerns, the lighthouse is now open to the public again.

> If you think bees are just out for a sting, think again. These tiny winged workers are running the world's sweetest gig—and they've got a whole day dedicated to their buzz-ness. Welcome to World Honey Bee Day, celebrated every third Saturday in August. About 35% of global food crop production relies on animal pollination, including honey bees. The value of crops pollinated by bees is estimated at hundreds of billions of dollars. Despite their superpowers, bees are in a sticky situation. Habitat loss, pesticides, disease, and climate change are making life in the hive less than ideal.
> 
> Today's image features a row of bright boxes in Italy—those are beehives. Bees use color to distinguish between hives, much like humans use house numbers. Blue, yellow, green, and red hives help reduce confusion and accidental hive invasions. On World Honey Bee Day, let's think outside the hive. Whether it's through colorful conservation, mindful eating, or planting for pollinators, there's always a way to 'bee' involved.

> It's a bird, it's a plane, it's … a fish! Gliding through the ocean with flapping fins and polka-dot flair, the spotted eagle ray refuses to blend in. It doesn't crawl along the seabed like its stingray cousins—it flies underwater. The species gets its name from—you guessed it—its protruding snout, which resembles an eagle's beak, and its distinctive spotted back, which is unique to each individual, much like fingerprints. Their wing-like pectoral fins can span up to 10 feet. Near the base of the long tail are venomous spines, in case a predator gets too close. These rays aren't aggressive, but they're not defenseless either.
> 
> These creatures are often seen alone, but when they travel in groups, it's a show worth watching. Dozens can glide together in perfect sync, like the ones photographed near San Cristóbal Island in Ecuador. They are also known to leap out of the water, sometimes completely clearing the surface, proving you don't need feathers to fly. Despite their elegance, spotted eagle rays are currently listed as near threatened. Their populations are declining due to various threats, including bycatch and habitat degradation.

> There's a mountain in Switzerland that's always looking down on you—but don't take it personally. At 10,026 feet, Piz Nair of the Albula Alps keeps an eye over the Engadine valley in Graubünden. Start in St. Moritz: hop on the funicular (a type of cable railway system) to Corviglia, then ride the cable car to the summit. At the top? A viewing platform and that famous ibex (an alpine goat) statue. There's also a restaurant where you can eat inside a glass cube with 360° views.
> 
> This alpine peak hosted the 1948 Winter Olympics and still boasts some of the most famous ski runs in the country. The 'Piz Nair Wall' is known for its challenging downhill skiing and events like the 2003 World Championship downhill race. Come summer, the snow clears but the trails stay hot. Hikers and mountain bikers flock here to explore alpine meadows, and soak in a different kind of silence. Guided tours and well-marked paths make it easy to find your footing. So, whether you're chasing snow, sun, or just a break from sea-level boredom, this Swiss giant will lift your spirits—literally.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
