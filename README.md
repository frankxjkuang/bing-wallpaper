<summary>Description</summary>

> This frosty scene shows Borovets, Bulgaria's oldest winter resort, established in 1896. It's a budget-friendly skiing alternative to the more expensive resorts in the Alps, especially for beginners and those looking for fun on the slopes without shelling out the big bucks.
> 
> The resort area was once used by Bulgarian royalty as hunting grounds. Borovets covers the foothills and ridge-spine of Musala Peak, the highest mountain in Bulgaria and the Balkans, in the eastern Rila Mountains, only a few dozen miles south of the national capital, Sofia.

<summary>Description</summary>

> It's that time again! Grab your binoculars and bird guide and head outside to start counting. The National Audubon Society's Christmas Bird Count starts on December 14 annually and runs until January 5. Originating as an actual hunt in the 19th century, on Christmas Day in 1900 someone had the bright idea to stop killing the birds and instead just observe them.
> 
> Conducted entirely by volunteers, the Christmas Bird Count is the largest citizen science project in the world. It helps to track the health and well-being of bird populations and is vital to conservation efforts. Without it, species like the great horned owl and the gilded flicker, seen nesting in a saguaro cactus in today's photo of Arizona's Sonoran Desert, could end up being underrepresented and possibly endangered.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This tiny, snow-dusted village is Hallstatt, in Austria's mountainous Salzkammergut region, sandwiched between the shore of Lake Hallstatt and the slopes of the Dachstein Mountains. The salt mines here are thought to be among the oldest in the world and were once the backbone of Hallstatt's economy. Today they're a popular tourist attraction—this little village draws in so many visitors that it is considered an area of over-tourism. Hallstatt has sought to limit the number of people who can visit each day.
> 
> Hallstatt's charms are so considerable that an identical recreation of the town was built in Guangdong, China, in 2011. So, if they can't squeeze you into Hallstatt, perhaps you can pop over to China's version.

<summary>Description</summary>

> It's been almost 200 years since poinsettias were first brought to the US from their native Mexico, where the Aztecs used the leaves to make dye and the sap to treat fevers. American botanist and government representative Joel Roberts Poinsett introduced the scarlet foliage to the US in 1828. Flash forward to the 1960s, when a breeding program resulted in hardier, fuller plants and many variations. The booming poinsettia wholesale trade in the US brings in a whopping $250 million a year. The House of Representatives designated December 12 as Poinsettia Day in 2002. Poinsettias are the top-selling potted plant in the US and Canada, brightening holiday tables every December.

> Jasper National Park boasts numerous breathtaking waterfalls, but the multi-tiered cascade of Tangle Creek Falls makes for a must-see spectacle. Located off the Icefields Parkway (Highway 93) in Alberta, the falls are easily accessed. Tangle Creek Falls' misty spray can be felt out on the highway itself. If you're looking to capture some breathtaking shots, it may be worth getting off the highway and going closer to the falls to truly soak in its beauty.

<summary>Description</summary>

> More than 2 miles above sea level, near the crest of the Andes, is an anomaly of the natural world, a salt flat bigger than many countries. The Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia is the largest salt flat in the world at about 4,000 square miles. The salt flat is the remains of an ancient lake that evaporated long ago leaving behind a thick mineral crust that is both a source of edible salt and a critical breeding ground for, of all things, flamingos. But for a battery-hungry world, the greatest riches might lie below the crust—a vast brine rich in lithium.

> These handsome beasts are a living legacy of primeval times—they've watched history unfold around them from the era of the woolly mammoth.  The cow and calf in our photo belong to Norway's only herd of muskoxen, and you can visit them in Dovre-Sunndalsfjella National Park. If you feel like roaming by yourself, follow the signposted Musk Ox Trail; just be aware that the massive animals are known to attack if they feel threatened, so give them a wide berth. That sound too scary? Jump on a park safari with an experienced guide who can keep you safe and help you see the muskox in all its hairy glory.
