> Nature has its tricks, and Sørvágsvatn is one of its best. World Lake Day is the perfect occasion to explore this optical illusion in the Faroe Islands, an autonomous administrative division of the Kingdom of Denmark. Also called Leitisvatn, this lake on the island of Vágar appears to float far above the ocean. In reality, it sits less than 100 feet above sea level. As the largest lake in the Faroes, Sørvágsvatn has a surface area of about 1.3 square miles and feeds the Bøsdalafossur waterfall, where its waters pour dramatically into the sea.
> 
> As we mark World Lake Day, Sørvágsvatn reminds us why lakes are so vital. They not only provide recreation but also store freshwater, regulate local climates, and support biodiversity. Yet today, many are under threat. Pollution, overuse, climate change, and fluctuating water levels are placing increasing pressure on these fragile ecosystems. So, the next time you look at a map, think of lakes not just as dots of blue but as living, breathing parts of our world that deserve our care and attention.

> If fairy tales had architects, they might've come up with something like Alberobello in Italy. But instead of magic wands, it was limestone, mortar-free masonry, and—according to some theories—a bit of tax evasion that built this town's signature homes: the trulli. These are whitewashed stone houses topped with dry-stacked limestone roofs shaped like upside-down ice cream cones. It's an ancient building technique, and in this case, a clever one. Back in the 14th century, locals were reportedly trying to avoid property taxes by constructing homes that could be quickly dismantled when the king's tax collector came around.
> 
> Alberobello's trulli aren't hidden one-offs. Entire districts—like Rione Monti and Aia Piccola—are packed with these quirky structures. Some are still lived in, while others have been transformed into cafés, souvenir shops, and pint-sized museums. You'll even find a church built in trullo style. In 1996, UNESCO gave the trulli of Alberobello the heritage stamp of approval. It's not every day that a loophole becomes a landmark.

> Today, the National Park Service celebrates another trip around the sun—and nearly 85 million acres of American beauty under its care. From geysers that spout like soda cans to ancient cliff dwellings tucked into canyon walls, the NPS has spent over a century preserving, protecting, and inviting people to take a hike—literally. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson signed the Organic Act into law, officially creating the NPS to 'conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects.' Since then, the NPS has grown to oversee more than 400 sites, including national parks, battlefields, monuments, and seashores.
> 
> What better spot to toast the occasion than the Calcite Springs Overlook in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming? This thermal-meets-canyon overlook offers front-row views of the Yellowstone River carving its way through a lava-forged canyon. Along the basalt cliffs, white mineral deposits that gave Calcite Springs its name are visible, formed by mineral-rich waters still steaming from underground. You might spot a bald eagle gliding overhead or bison lounging nearby. Yellowstone is more than just a park—it's a supervolcano with a visitor center.

> Flat antlers? Check. Spotted coat? Check. Side-eye from the bushes? Also check. Say hello to the European fallow deer. These medium-sized deer have been strutting through British woodlands and parklands for centuries. Though they look right at home, they weren't born here. The Romans likely brought them over, and the Normans later made them common in hunting parks. Now, they're regulars in landscapes from Sussex to Scotland.
> 
> In summer, these animals sport a reddish-brown coat with white spots. Come winter, they trade it for a darker, grayer version. Bucks (males) grow broad, shovel-shaped antlers, unlike the pointy racks of red or roe deer. In autumn, the bucks clash antlers in the rutting season, competing for the attention of does (females). Fallow deer graze mainly on grasses and leaves, but they won't turn their noses up at herbs, shrubs, or the occasional snack from a fruit tree. Despite their poise, they're quick to bolt if spooked. That flash of white tail you see? That's their way of saying 'time to run.' It's also a signal to the rest of the herd.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Rising like a stone hymn in the heart of Kutná Hora, a town in Czechia, the Cathedral of St. Barbara is an example of medieval grandeur dedicated to the patron saint of miners—an enduring symbol for a community whose lifeblood was silver. The miners themselves played a key role in building the cathedral that still bears her name.
> 
> Construction began in the Middle Ages but wasn't completed until the 20th century, weaving together Gothic artistry and modern details. Originally envisioned on a much grander scale—twice its current size—the cathedral's fate was tied to the fortunes of the silver mines. As the mines declined, so did the ambitions. By 1588, only the iconic three-peaked roof had been completed, and a temporary wall signaled the halt of construction. In the years that followed, the Jesuits took over, gradually introducing Baroque elements into the original Gothic design. Restoration efforts finally took shape in the late 19th century, led by architects Josef Mocker and Ludvik Labler.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Wave after wave of velvety hills stretch across the Palouse. This tranquil region lies in southeastern Washington, extending to the borders of Idaho and Oregon. The wheat-covered slopes shift in color with every passing season. In spring, the hills turn lush shades of green as young wheat and barley begin to grow, while summer transforms them into dry, golden browns as the crops near harvest.
> 
> Often hailed as one of Washington State's most serene natural wonders, the Palouse owes its signature rolling hills to an ancient and fascinating geological story. These dune-like hills were shaped over thousands of years—not by rivers or tectonic shifts, but by windblown dust and fine silt, known as 'loess,' carried from the arid Southwest. During the Ice Ages, glaciers from Canada ground rock into fine 'glacial flour,' which flowed into the prehistoric Glacial Lake Missoula. When ice dams broke, floods swept across eastern Washington, leaving behind layers of silt. Prevailing winds later carried that dust to this region, settling it into the hills we see today.

<summary>Description</summary>

> You don't need to be a bird expert to notice the wheatear darting across open ground. These ground-dwelling songbirds are known for their upright posture and habit of hopping or sprinting between perches. Despite the name, wheatears have nothing to do with wheat or ears—the name is a twist on the old phrase 'white arse,' pointing to the bird's distinctive white rump found in most species. The northern wheatear weighs less than an ounce, but travels thousands of miles between its summer homes in Alaska and northern Canada to its wintering grounds in Africa. Its migration route is one of the longest for a bird its size. Unlike many backyard songbirds, wheatears prefer wide-open spaces with low vegetation, where they can sprint and pounce on insects. And while most North American birders might only catch them in the far north, wheatears are widespread across Europe, Asia, and Africa.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
