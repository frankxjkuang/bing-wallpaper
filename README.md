> 'Art is the queen of all sciences communicating knowledge to all the generations of the world.' Let’s ponder these inspirational words by Leonardo da Vinci on World Art Day, April 15, which was also the birthday of the renowned Renaissance artist. From his iconic painting of the Mona Lisa to his detailed sketches of flying machines, Leonardo pushed the boundaries of knowledge and talent in a wide range of fields. Today's homepage shows the RedBall Project at Centraal Station in Antwerp, Belgium. Created by the American artist Kurt Perschke, this traveling public art installation is considered to be the world's longest-running street artwork. Since 2001, the 15-foot inflated red ball has been wedged into dozens of landmarks in countries from Australia to England.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to nature's bowling alley. Bowling Ball Beach on the Mendocino Coast in California is named after the striking rock formations strewn across the shore. These sandstone balls—a phenomenon known as concretions—formed over millions of years as sedimentary layers built up around a central core of sand and stone held together by mineral cements. Erosion gradually wore away the outer layers to expose the spherical shapes we see today. This created a fascinating spectacle that only appears at low tide. Concretions are rare, and there has been plenty of wild speculation about where they come from, with some believing them to be extraterrestrial debris while others wondering if they are dinosaur fossils. The answer, however, is quite simple: it is the forces of nature at play.

> If you fancy a stroll through time, Arches National Park is the perfect gateway! With over 2,000 natural stone arches, hundreds of tall pinnacles, large rock fins, and giant balanced rocks, this park is among the world's most scenic destinations. In the popular Windows Section, covering just over 2 square miles, there are spectacular rock formations including North Window, Turret Arch, and Double Arch. Others include Garden of Eden, Elephant Butte, a 5,653-foot summit, and Parade of Elephants, so visitors are never short of awesome sights to enjoy.
> 
> The region was once a vast dry seabed hidden beneath thousands of feet of earth but was gradually transformed by geological forces to become the spectacular space we see today. Humans have explored and lived in this area for millennia. Around 2,000 years ago, its nomadic inhabitants began to cultivate crops. However, environmental challenges, possibly aggravated by climate shifts, eventually led to a decline in farming activities.

Also known as Dragon Falls, the cascade featured in today's image is in a narrow niche at the southern end of the canyon that divides the mountain of Auyán-tepui. Falling from around 1,300 feet, Churún Merú is joined by a neighboring stream in the wet season. Venezuela is home to some of the world's most impressive natural wonders, including the highest waterfall on Earth, Angel Falls, found some 4 miles south of Churún Merú.

> Oh brother! April 10 is National Siblings Day, a time to celebrate the special bonds shared by brothers and sisters. From friendly rivalries to shared memories, there's nothing quite like the relationship between siblings. Siblings Day was created by Claudia Evart in memory of her siblings Alan and Lisette. Today, it is recognized by 49 states and 14 countries. Celebrations of this day can range from something simple, like phoning your siblings to let them know you're thinking of them, to giving gifts or sharing a meal.

> In today's image, we see four burrowing owls in Wyoming, standing near their burrow, looking like a band of mischievous siblings. Known for their distinctive white eyebrows and yellow eyes, these owls are active during the day, hunting insects and small mammals. Just like siblings, they often look out for each other, warning one another of predators by listening out for prairie dogs' alarm calls. So, how are you going to celebrate this Siblings Day?
