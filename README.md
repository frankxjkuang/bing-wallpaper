<summary>Description</summary>

> Somewhere in the wide prairies of northeastern Wyoming stands Devils Tower, a stone formation that rises from the open plains. Once called Bear Lodge, the butte gained its current name during an 1875 expedition led by Colonel Richard Irving Dodge, possibly after an interpreter mistranslated a Native phrase as 'Bad God's Tower.' The missing apostrophe in its official title follows standard geographic naming conventions—hence, the signs read 'Devils Tower.' In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed it the nation's first national monument; a milestone whose anniversary falls today.
> 
> As you approach Devils Tower, every curve in the road unveils a new view—whether you're arriving from the highway, winding toward the visitor center, or following the Tower Trail on foot. The site's significance stretches far deeper than its dramatic geology. For centuries, numerous tribes from the Great Plains and Black Hills, including the Arapaho, Crow, and Cheyenne, have been linked to this place. Each tribe preserves oral traditions about the Tower's creation. While many of these accounts share recurring themes, the details remain unique to every community. Devils Tower continues to embody a living chronicle of geology, heritage, and the ever-changing relationship between humans and the natural world.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Spot a flash of yellow on its chest and a bill that looks painted by an artist—that's the keel-billed toucan. A member of the Ramphastidae family, which includes toucan barbets, it is one of more than 40 toucan species. Found from southern Mexico to northern Colombia, it spends much of its day plucking fruit with a rainbow-colored bill about one-third of its total length. It also eats insects, eggs, and small reptiles when available. The bill not only helps it eat but also keeps the toucan cool by radiating excess heat—thanks to the blood vessels running through it. This social bird often moves in small groups, chattering and gliding between treetops. With each wing measuring 7–8 inches, the keel-billed toucan molts, or sheds its feathers, just once a year.
> 
> When the breeding season arrives, a pair claims a tree cavity. The female lays two to four eggs, and both parents share incubation duty. The chicks hatch featherless, with closed eyes and tiny, pale bills. Over the weeks, their colors emerge, and they begin taking short flights. So, if you catch a glimpse of one, remember: It's more than a pretty face—it's a smart, social, and well-equipped rainforest multitasker.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Fall isn't just marked by the calendar. Each September, Earth's subtle tilt brings the autumn equinox—one of two times a year when day and night are nearly equal in length. It marks the beginning of fall in the Northern Hemisphere. From solar alignments to changing leaves, nature offers its own quiet signals that the season has shifted. While for most of us it may seem like just another day, ancient cultures paid close attention to this change. Sites like Chichén Itzá in Mexico and England's Stonehenge were designed to align with the rising or setting sun during equinox days.
> 
> One of the best places to catch the change in season? Fishlake National Forest in Utah. As September rolls in, the aspen trees seen in today's image begin their annual transformation, turning vivid shades of yellow that ripple across the hills. The forest covers more than 2,300 square miles of lakes, trails, and mountains that shine with fall color. There's something grounding about watching the season change in sync with something much older than the Gregorian calendar we follow.

> Think sea otters are just about whiskers and floating naps? There's more going on behind those button eyes. Every year, Sea Otter Awareness Week highlights their role in maintaining coastal ecosystems. Launched in 2003 by Defenders of Wildlife—a nonprofit conservation organization—this week promotes education and action. In Alaska's Prince William Sound, sea otters drift on ice or crack shellfish on their bellies using their favorite rock, as seen in today's image. Less visible is how their appetite for sea urchins helps protect kelp forests.
> 
> Often seen floating in 'rafts,' holding paws to stay connected, they appear serene—but their history tells a different story. Hunted extensively for their dense fur from 1741 to 1911, sea otters were pushed to the brink of extinction before rebounding through conservation. Still, dangers remain. Oil spills, fishing gear, disease, and warming oceans continue to threaten their survival. Otters rely on clean, cold water. Their fur isn't waterproof—it traps air for warmth, and any oil contamination can be fatal. This week serves as a call to notice them—and to protect the waters they call home.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Every fall, Theresienwiese, a square in Munich, Germany, transforms into one of the world's largest festivals—Oktoberfest. First held in 1810 to celebrate a royal wedding, it has grown into a 16- to 18-day tradition attracting more than 6 million people from around the globe. The scale is staggering: The festival grounds span about 4.5 million square feet and host 14 main tents, each seating thousands. Each year, visitors consume around 7 million liters of beer, along with mountains of pretzels, sausages, and gingerbread hearts. All beer served at Oktoberfest comes from Munich breweries and meets the strict standards of the Reinheitsgebot, the German Beer Purity Law.
> 
> Beyond the drinks and food, the sprawling fairground is its own world, filled with roller coasters, games, and classic rides. Among them, the Wellenflug, the swing carousel pictured here, offers sweeping views of the festival grounds and the Munich skyline. This year, the festival begins today and runs through October 5. Whether you come for the beer, the pretzels, or the thrill of dangling your feet high above the city, Oktoberfest has a seat waiting for you.

<summary>Description</summary>

> When you hear 'Thousand Islands,' you might think of a jar of salad dressing, but the namesake of that creamy condiment is one of North America's most enchanting regions. The Thousand Islands form an archipelago in the St. Lawrence River, spanning the state of New York and the province of Ontario. It is made up of more than 1,800 islands. Some of these islands have fairytale castles; others are barely big enough for a hammock. There's also Just Room Enough Island, which lives up to its name with a single house and a lone tree.
> 
> The Thousand Islands are perfect for slow-paced exploration. Boat tours take you past grand estates and historic lighthouses, often stopping at landmarks like Boldt Castle and Singer Castle. Kayakers are drawn to the region's clear waters and serene coves. Thanks to a unique microclimate, local winemakers craft award-winning wines that are well worth sampling. Oh, and the salad dressing? Legend says a local fishing guide's wife first created it for dinner guests, including actress May Irwin, who enjoyed it so much that she asked for the recipe. The rest, as they say, is delicious history.

> This stunning view—where the sky meets the open waters of the Atlantic—is accessible only by foot. Tucked away on Ireland's wild and beautiful Dingle Peninsula, Dunquin Pier is one of the most photogenic spots in County Kerry. The small pier is famous for its winding, serpentine path that zigzags dramatically down the cliffside like a ribbon. These steep curves aren't just for the thrill—they're the only way to reach the pier below, where boats depart for the remote Blasket Islands.
> 
> The nearby village of Dunquin (Dún Chaoin in Irish) is Ireland's westernmost settlement, offering sweeping views and a deep connection to Irish heritage. With a population of just over 100, Dunquin is known for its strong Gaelic traditions, storytelling, and ties to the Blasket Island writers. Visitors often stop at the Blasket Centre, a cultural museum that tells the story of island life and emigration. Whether you're drawn by the dramatic landscape or the rich cultural heritage, Dunquin offers a uniquely Irish experience that feels both timeless and unforgettable.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
