Today's homepage star is an Allen's hummingbird, which grows to about 3.5 inches in length and is found along the west coast of North America, most commonly in California. National Hummingbird Day aims to boost the preservation of these mini marvels, by protecting them and their habitat.

> When the Mushroom Council decided it was high time to 'champignon' these versatile fungi, they settled on September as the perfect time to do so. National Mushroom Month highlights their importance and encourages you to know your mushrooms. For example, poisonous jack-o'-lantern mushrooms are sometimes misidentified as edible chanterelles. Others have medicinal properties like today's homepage species, turkey tail, used to treat lung conditions in traditional Chinese medicine. Recent research showed them exhibiting anti-tumor properties and helping fortify the immune system. Other mushrooms make great meal additions, and from portobello to shiitake mushrooms, there are thousands of edible species out there. Sautéed, stuffed, sliced, on a pizza, or in soup, it is time to bring some umami fun(gi) to your plate!

> Massive succulents against a mountainous backdrop, underneath the sun-kissed Arizona sky—it's prickly perfection. Pictured here are saguaro (pronounced 'sah-wah-roh') cacti at the Ironwood Forest National Monument in the Sonoran Desert. Even if you haven't seen one in person, when you hear the word cactus, you're probably thinking of saguaro—tall, green, cylindrical, with arms pointing upward. From tattoos to coffee cups, you'll find this iconic symbol of Arizona on almost everything. Though they are slow growers, these plants have been known to live over 200 years and reach enormous heights, with a 78-footer setting the record. Another cactus, known as 'Grandaddy,' survived in the sweltering desert for about 300 years, eventually succumbing to old age in the early 1990s. Cacti may not be for everyone, but they tend to grow on you (figuratively, of course)!

<summary>Description</summary>

> Say hello to the largest fish in the world, the whale shark. On August 30, we celebrate International Whale Shark Day to honor these magnificent marine creatures. These gentle giants are not related to whales, despite their impressive size—they can reach up to 40 feet in length. Whale sharks are calm creatures which are usually safe for divers to swim alongside. These sharks are filter feeders and consume plankton and small fish by sieving them through their gill plates. There has been a significant decline in their populations, with an estimated 63% decrease in their numbers in the last 75 years. Threats include being hit by boats or tangled in fishing gear and their habitats are being damaged by pollution, coastal development and over-fishing. Advocates work through education and community engagement to help safeguard whale sharks and preserve our oceans.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The bison is a majestic, massive creature, a true emblem of the American frontier spirit. These sturdy animals roamed North America's prairies for thousands of years in numbers estimated to be as high as 60 million. But settlement of the American West caused habitat loss, and that, combined with overhunting, nearly wiped out the species altogether by the end of the 19th century. Ranchers, conservationists, Native American tribes, and politicians worked to save the bison and today, nearly 500,000 bison can be found in North America. About 15,000 animals are in free-roaming herds that graze on US public lands, like the bison in today's image, shown at Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming.
> 
> For such large animals, bison are surprisingly agile. They're nearly 7 feet tall at their hump and weigh up to 2,000 pounds, but they can run up to 35 miles per hour, jump high fences, and are strong swimmers. In 2016, President Barack Obama paid tribute to these proud beasts by signing the Bison Legacy Act, naming bison the national mammal of the United States.

> Though you might instinctively watch out for invading fleets or dragons overhead, you're more likely to encounter a tourist than a Lannister in the Croatian city of Dubrovnik. As you may know, 'Game of Thrones' filmed here frequently throughout the run of the show, and you can scarcely blame them; Dubrovnik's Old Town is one of the best-preserved medieval cities in the world. For centuries it flourished as the Republic of Ragusa, maintaining independence through diplomacy and robust trade networks. This 'Pearl of the Adriatic' has withstood military bombardments and devastating earthquakes, yet the city has always rebuilt and persevered. While pop culture, history, and UNESCO World Heritage Site status are all big draws, they might be too effective: A recent report estimated that in 2019 there were 36 tourists for every resident.
