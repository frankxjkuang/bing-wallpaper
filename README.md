> Say hello to the largest fish in the world, the whale shark. On August 30, we celebrate International Whale Shark Day to honor these magnificent marine creatures. These gentle giants are not related to whales, despite their impressive size—they can reach up to 40 feet in length. Whale sharks are calm creatures which are usually safe for divers to swim alongside. These sharks are filter feeders and consume plankton and small fish by sieving them through their gill plates. There has been a significant decline in their populations, with an estimated 63% decrease in their numbers in the last 75 years. Threats include being hit by boats or tangled in fishing gear and their habitats are being damaged by pollution, coastal development and over-fishing. Advocates work through education and community engagement to help safeguard whale sharks and preserve our oceans.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The bison is a majestic, massive creature, a true emblem of the American frontier spirit. These sturdy animals roamed North America's prairies for thousands of years in numbers estimated to be as high as 60 million. But settlement of the American West caused habitat loss, and that, combined with overhunting, nearly wiped out the species altogether by the end of the 19th century. Ranchers, conservationists, Native American tribes, and politicians worked to save the bison and today, nearly 500,000 bison can be found in North America. About 15,000 animals are in free-roaming herds that graze on US public lands, like the bison in today's image, shown at Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming.
> 
> For such large animals, bison are surprisingly agile. They're nearly 7 feet tall at their hump and weigh up to 2,000 pounds, but they can run up to 35 miles per hour, jump high fences, and are strong swimmers. In 2016, President Barack Obama paid tribute to these proud beasts by signing the Bison Legacy Act, naming bison the national mammal of the United States.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Though you might instinctively watch out for invading fleets or dragons overhead, you're more likely to encounter a tourist than a Lannister in the Croatian city of Dubrovnik. As you may know, 'Game of Thrones' filmed here frequently throughout the run of the show, and you can scarcely blame them; Dubrovnik's Old Town is one of the best-preserved medieval cities in the world. For centuries it flourished as the Republic of Ragusa, maintaining independence through diplomacy and robust trade networks. This 'Pearl of the Adriatic' has withstood military bombardments and devastating earthquakes, yet the city has always rebuilt and persevered. While pop culture, history, and UNESCO World Heritage Site status are all big draws, they might be too effective: A recent report estimated that in 2019 there were 36 tourists for every resident.

> The South Korean island of Jeju is full of wonders. If you don't have a chance to visit its volcanic landscape, ancient stone statues, waterfalls, and rocky coastline, you can dive into the island's fascinating chronicles from the comfort of your computer. The star of today's image, Seongsan Ilchulbong (Sunrise Peak), is the island's rare tuff cone formation, created by an underwater volcanic eruption about 5,000 years ago. Tuff cones are also called ash cones, referring to the accumulated ash settling in a cone formation after the lava's forceful explosion. Seongsan Ilchulbong was added to the UNESCO World Natural Heritage List in 2007.

> As the summer is fading away, we find ourselves reminiscing about vacations and long hours of lively evenings. But let's not bury the picnic days just yet! There is plenty to look forward to, especially if you are in Berlin. The Long Night of Museums only happens once a year—on the last Saturday of August since 1997—but it shakes up Museum Island and the rest of the German capital. The event series is more than a peaceful appreciation of artifacts—quite the opposite—you can expect music, talks, workshops, cocktails, dance, and more from 6 PM into the small hours of the morning. Featured in today's image, Museum Island—embraced by the Spree River—is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it is home to a museum quintet: Altes, Bode, Pergamon, and Neues Museums, and Alte Nationalgalerie.

> Though summer is winding down, it's not too late to pack some gear and head into the great outdoors. Unsure where to go? Look no further than our 63 national parks, which exist thanks to the National Park Service, created on this day in 1916 by President Woodrow Wilson. He ordered the service to preserve the landscape, wildlife, and history of the parks 'in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.' In other words, the park service was established for all of us! Just make sure that whether you're visiting the islands of American Samoa, the glaciers of the North Cascades, the waterways of the Everglades, or the 308-foot Lower Falls of Yellowstone in today's image, that you explore them with care and appreciation so that they can be preserved for centuries to come.

> Shark Fin Cove, also known as Shark Tooth Beach, is nestled in a cove in the tiny town of Davenport on California's Central Coast. The cove is a coastal gem known for its stunning sea stack—a vertical rock formation that resembles a shark's fin. The fin used to be connected to the mudstone cliff that surrounds the beach. Over time, the relentless crashing waves and strong winds slowly eroded the rock formation. Shark Fin Cove is visible from Highway 1, where travelers can stop and look at the expansive Pacific Ocean views.
