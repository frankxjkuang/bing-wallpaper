<summary>Description</summary>

> Sea stars—often called starfish—are some of the most fascinating creatures to live in our oceans. For starters, despite their name, they aren't fish—they belong to a group of marine invertebrates called echinoderms. Like all echinoderms, sea stars are characterized by the radial symmetry of their bodies, which usually have multiple arms extending from the central disc.
> 
> Did you know that sea stars can regenerate their arms? This means if they are attacked by a predator, they can get back into shape eventually (and quite literally). In fact, some species can also regenerate an entirely new sea star from just the arm, provided it still has a bit of the central disc attached to it.

> Phlox subulata is known by many names. While some call it moss pink, others call it creeping phlox, flowering moss, or mountain phlox. No matter what name you know it by, you cannot deny the beauty and charm of these tiny perennial flowers. They bloom in spring and add bright splashes of color wherever they grow.
> 
> This plant's small flowers and carpet-like growth pattern give the appearance of moss; hence, the name. Japan's Hitsujiyama Park in Chichibu is known for shibazakura, as it's known in Japanese. When these flowers are in full bloom, they cover the rolling hills in the park and offer a breathtaking horticultural view.

> On April 12, 1961, Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin astounded the world by becoming the first person to travel to outer space. In less than two hours, Gagarin completed a full orbit of the Earth in the Vostok 3KA spacecraft. Less than a month later, Mercury astronaut Alan Shepard became the first American in space. The spectacle of looking back at Earth from space has not lost its charm, as you can see in today's picture taken from the International Space Station. Also known as the 'World Space Party,' Yuri's Night is a global celebration of astronomy and a reflection on how space exploration can unite people in a divided world.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Mossy Grotto Falls is a tiny 20-foot waterfall in Oregon's Columbia River Gorge, home to around 90 waterfalls. This winsome waterfall became popular in recent years after several renowned photographers snapped it following its discovery in 2006. Waterfalls around the world draw our attention and inspire emotions (and even themes for pop songs). In contrast to the serene, burbling Mossy Grotto Falls, Angel Falls in Venezuela is the tallest in the world, where water plunges 2,648 feet before reaching the ground. This roaring wonder is awe-inspiring and one of the top tourist-draws in the country. If you need a moment of reflection, we recommend searching for the nearest waterfall and taking a trip to connect with nature.

<summary>Description</summary>

> We're in Kenya's Amboseli National Park today to celebrate Siblings Day with these baby African elephant twins and their mom. Siblings Day is celebrated every April 10 in parts of the US and other areas of the world. In 1995, Claudia Evart, who lost her siblings at a young age, created this holiday and established the Siblings Day Foundation, which is working to get the holiday officially recognized in the US alongside Mother's Day and Father's Day. India's Raksha Bandhan is the oldest sibling holiday that is still widely observed today, usually falling in August. Hindu women commemorate this day by wrapping a band around their brothers' wrists as a sign of mutual care and respect. If this seems like too much, maybe just pick up the phone and give a loved one a call.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Humans have been decorating eggs for Easter for centuries, but decorated ostrich eggs have been found from as far back as 60,000 years ago, long before the Christian festival began. The Easter egg has long been a symbol of fertility and rebirth, but exactly why people started decorating them is unclear. One theory is that, because animal products were not eaten during the religious Lenten season, people would hard-boil the eggs and decorate them with dye and wax, until they could be eaten at Easter. A more opulent type of decorated egg, Fabergé eggs, were famously created as bejeweled Easter gifts to the Russian imperial family. Our homepage image shows eggs from Lithuania, where people use traditional methods to paint patterns with wax using sharp objects or etch patterns into dyed eggs.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Throughout history, humans have crafted legends to explain natural phenomena that defy our understanding. A prime example is the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland where some 40,000 basalt columns spring from the ground at the shore. Scientists tell us these columns developed 50 to 60 million years ago, when lava erupted from volcanic fissures, then cooled and contracted, cracking into hexagonal structures.
> 
> But Gaelic legend tells a different tale. It says the giant Fionn mac Cumhaill, anglicized as Finn McCool, built a bridge across the sea to fight his Scottish giant counterpart, Benandonner. The remains of his bridge are said to be found in the Giant's Causeway on one side, and Fingal's Cave on the Scottish island of Staffa, also formed by basalt columns. Though we understand the geology of the Giant's Causeway now, some may prefer to picture giants striding across the sea.
