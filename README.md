> El Valle de la Luna (the Valley of the Moon) is located in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. The Achaches Lookout, seen here, offers breathtaking views of volcanoes in the distance. In 1982, El Valle de la Luna was declared a nature sanctuary for its stunning, untouched habitat and its peculiar lunar-like terrain.
> 
> This desolate landscape nestled in the Cordillera del la Sal (the Salt Mountain range) boasts giant dunes, steep canyons, and unusual stone, sand, and salt formations carved by wind and water. Nothing grows here—the Atacama Desert is one of the driest places on Earth—but the sunsets are said to be spectacular.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we're celebrating Darwin Day with this blue-footed booby on the shores of the Galápagos Islands, where the famous naturalist observed wildlife and collected specimens that would inform his theory of evolution.
> 
> The distinctive, bright blue feet of these marine birds are particularly eye-catching, as is their exuberant mating dance. The male struts around showing off the blueness of his feet to prospective mates. These birds often mate for life and recognize their partner by their unique call.
> 
> What about that name? It's said to be derived, rather unkindly, from the Spanish word 'bobo,' which means stupid, as they can be clumsy on land and were easily caught by sailors. They're much more graceful in the air, however, swooping from great heights and plunging into the water at speeds of up to 60 mph to catch small fish to eat.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This iconic view of the Milky Way from Zabriskie Point in California will draw crowds of photographers and tourists this weekend, as the Death Valley Dark Sky Festival begins. Death Valley National Park offers some of the best stargazing in the US and has been awarded the highest ‘gold tier’ rating by the International Dark-Sky Association.
> 
> The geology here is another star attraction. Zabriskie Point's terrain has played a role in movies from 'Spartacus' to 'Stars Wars' and the scenic overlook is featured on the cover of rock band U2's album 'The Joshua Tree.' Weather and water carved out these badlands over eons, resulting in colorful striped rock formations while the darker material on several peaks was formed by lava from an ancient volcanic eruption. All are best enjoyed under a stunning celestial lightshow afforded by some of the darkest night skies in the country.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Hidden in the eastern hills of Greece’s Peloponnese peninsula, about 100 miles from Athens, lies the ancient theater of Epidaurus. Built in the 4th century BCE, this massive open-air venue, which could hold about 14,000 spectators, is known for its perfect architectural proportions. It sits alongside several ancient Greek monuments in the wider Sanctuary of Asclepius, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
> 
> The theater was part of a complex dedicated to Asclepius, the Greek god of medicine, and hosted music, singing and dramatic games that were included in his worship. It has the three main features of the Greek auditoria: a circular space used as the main stage, a stage building that serves as a backdrop, and an ascending row of seats in a semi-circular shape. The theater is a feat of engineering built into the hillside with such precision that it has both perfect acoustics and optimal sight lines.
> 
> This ancient masterpiece is still in use today, occasionally hosting musical events and welcoming theatrical performances for the Epidaurus Festival each summer.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we're peering up from the depths of Lower Antelope Canyon, located in Lake Powell Navajo Tribal Park near Page, Arizona. This tall, narrow channel is an entry point into Antelope Canyon, a slot canyon that was created over millions of years by flash floods carving away at the soft Navajo sandstone.
> 
> The Navajo name for Lower Antelope Canyon is Hazdistazí (spiral rock arches), but hikers have nicknamed it the Corkscrew for its twists and turns. Visitors shimmy through tight passages and climb up and down ladders to reach the bottom of the chamber. There they find themselves in an almost otherworldly environment, where sunbeams break through to the canyon floor, making the stone walls glow.
> 
> Tour guides, managed by the Navajo Nation, are mandatory for visitors to the canyon.

> With sweeping views of fjords, mountains, and the sea, this is possibly one of the most beautiful places in the world to rest when you are on the road. Ureddplassen, also known as Uredd Rest Area, provides a place for respite to travelers on a section of the Helgelandskysten national scenic route in Norway. It also serves as a WWII memorial, sharing its name with a Norwegian submarine which was lost when it hit a German mine in February 1943.
> 
> With its minimalist architecture and breath-taking scenery, Ureddplassen offers a visual experience like no other. It has marble benches and steps leading out to the open sea, and a wave-shaped public restroom with frosted glass that lights up beautifully in the dark.
> 
> Since its unveiling, the rest area has quickly become a popular tourist destination. Here, visitors and locals can witness the midnight sun in summer and feast their eyes on the northern lights in winter.

Labro, which covers about 4.4 square miles, was founded sometime between the 9th and 10th centuries and was assigned to a powerful aristocratic family by Emperor Otto the Great. Perched atop a wooded hill, the Nobili-Vitelleschi castle originally served to secure the border and control communication routes in the valley below.

> With its panoramic views and historic buildings, Labro is now a popular tourist destination, having been restored for the purpose shortly after World War II, when its existence was threatened by a mass exodus of the population.
