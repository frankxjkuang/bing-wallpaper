> Watch closely; you might catch a glimpse of the black-naped monarch. This bird is part of the monarch flycatcher family, which also includes shrikebills, magpie-larks, and paradise flycatchers. Found across tropical southern Asia, from Iran and Sri Lanka to Indonesia and the Philippines, the black-naped monarch prefers dense forests and other lush, wooded spots. It perches upright on its short legs and spends most of its time catching insects in midair. These birds occupy the dense understory of the forest canopy.
> 
> During the breeding season, the female black-naped monarch lays two or three eggs in a cozy, cup-shaped nest tucked into a tree fork, as seen in today's image. The nest is woven with filaments of spider webs and marasmius, a type of mushroom-producing fungus known for its natural antibiotic properties. This clever design may help shield young birds from harmful infections, turning the nest into a tiny, self-sustaining sanctuary. And here's another touch—Mama Bird even decorates the nest with spider-egg cases.

> Lights on, curtains rise—it's World Theater Day. Since 1961, this annual event by the International Theater Institute (ITI) has united audiences and artists in a shared appreciation of storytelling, creativity, and culture. Every year, a renowned theater figure is invited by ITI to deliver a message that resonates across the industry. Their words are translated into more than 50 languages and shared with people all over the world. These messages highlight theater's role in society—be it as a mirror to reality, an agent of change, or a refuge for the imagination. From Shakespeare's soliloquies to experimental avant-garde productions, theater has continuously evolved while holding onto its core: human connection.
> 
> So, what better place to celebrate today than at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus? Located at the foot of the Acropolis in Athens, Greece, this stone Roman theater has been setting the scene for performances for nearly two millennia. Built in 161 CE by the wealthy Roman Herodes Atticus in memory of his wife, the ancient venue has hosted everything from classical tragedies to modern-day concerts. Despite the passing centuries, its acoustics still strike the right chord.

> Manatees don't rush through life—they float. These gentle giants of the sea have been gliding through warm waters for millions of years, minding their own business and munching on seagrass. But despite their laid-back nature, they face serious threats. Hence, the last Wednesday of March is dedicated to them—Manatee Appreciation Day.
> 
> There are three species of manatees: the West Indian, the Amazonian, and the African manatee. The West Indian manatee, which includes the Florida manatee, can grow up to 13 feet long and weigh over 1,000 pounds. These peaceful creatures spend most of their time grazing and napping. They have no natural predators, but human activity poses a major risk. Boat strikes are a leading cause of injury and death, as these marine mammals are too slow to dodge speeding vessels. Habitat loss and pollution also threaten their survival. Conservation efforts, including speed limits in manatee zones and habitat protection, have helped, but these sea cows still need all the support they can get.

> Today is Tolkien Reading Day. It's a time to dust off well-worn copies of 'The Lord of the Rings' or 'The Hobbit,' and journey once more into the lands of elves, dwarves, and one particularly famous ring. But why this date? March 25 is the day the One Ring was destroyed, bringing down Sauron and ending his dark reign. The observation was launched in 2003 to encourage people to explore J.R.R. Tolkien's works. Schools, libraries, and fans worldwide take part, reading passages aloud, discussing favorite moments, and diving into the rich lore of Middle-earth. Some go all out with themed events, cosplay, and even second breakfasts—because what better way to honor Tolkien than by feasting like a hobbit?
> 
> Tolkien's writings extend far beyond Middle-earth. His academic work on language and mythology, his poetry, and lesser-known stories like in 'The Silmarillion' offer plenty for curious readers. Not sure where to start? Try reading the iconic 'All That is Gold Does Not Glitter' poem, revisiting Bilbo's riddle battle with Gollum, or even touring a hobbit-hole at Hobbiton Movie Set in Waikato, New Zealand, like the one pictured here.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Desert elephants, found in Namibia and Mali, are African bush elephants that have adapted to the harsh conditions of the Namib and Sahara deserts. These extremely arid regions receive less than 2.75 inches of annual rainfall. Compared to other bush elephants, desert elephants have longer legs, broader feet, and slightly smaller bodies. These resilient herbivores migrate between waterholes, following ancient routes based on seasonal food and water availability. Male desert elephants often roam alone over vast areas, while female-led family groups stay near rivers, where food is more plentiful. Their incredible adaptability is showcased by their ability to travel long distances, sometimes 43 miles in a single night, to find their favorite myrrh bushes.

For the annual event, the WMO places emphasis on a different pressing topic each year. The slogan of 2025, 'Closing the early warning gap together,' highlights the importance of timely weather alerts and early action.

> Pictured here is awe-inspiring anvil crawler lightning in Nebraska, a state renowned for its tornadoes and thunderstorms, typically during spring and summer. Anvil crawlers are tree-like lightning discharges that move horizontally. Nebraska's location in the Great Plains makes it a hotspot for storm activity. Thanks to the WMO's advancements in meteorology, we can better predict and respond to these dramatic weather events, safeguarding lives and property.

> March 22 is World Water Day, a United Nations initiative highlighting the importance of fresh water and its conservation. This day raises awareness about the global water crisis and promotes actions to ensure clean water for all. Fresh water is vital—not just for drinking, but for ecosystems, agriculture, and cultural heritage.
> 
> A stunning example of nature's freshwater wonders is Cenote Nicte Ha in Tulum, Mexico, seen in today's image. A cenote is a natural sinkhole that arises from the collapse of limestone bedrock, exposing groundwater. Named after the Mayan words for flower (nicte) and water (ha), this open cenote is known for its turquoise waters and abundant water lilies. Sunlight filters through its surface, supporting aquatic life. For the ancient Maya, cenotes were sacred portals to the underworld and vital water sources in the Yucatán Peninsula. With a maximum depth of approximately 32 feet, Cenote Nicte Ha is a popular spot for snorkeling and diving and offers a glimpse into an ancient and fragile ecosystem.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
