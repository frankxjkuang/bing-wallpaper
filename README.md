> In the world of birdwatching, the Christmas Bird Count, first held back in 1900, is a highlight of the year. The original bird count involved just 27 people spread over 25 locations in the US and Canada. Since then, the annual bird census has grown exponentially, with participants in more than 2,360 locations across various countries.
> 
> In North America's coniferous forests lives a tiny bird of prey—the boreal owl. The small brown and white-flecked raptor is shy and keeps well hidden from our view. Despite its compact size, it is a formidable hunter, feeding on small mammals, voles, and birds. With dark plumage and expressive eyes, it strikes a captivating figure in the moonlit canopy, intriguing bird enthusiasts and researchers. Any birder would be fortunate to spot one during their Christmas Bird Count.

> Housed in the Arctic Circle, Norway's Lofoten Islands are a crossroads of traditional life and modern industry. One of two towns in Lofoten, Svolvaer boasts a long history as a fishing village. Before it became a town of its own, it was part of the town of Vågan, where people have lived for over 1,000 years. Beyond fishing, it also serves as a sanctuary for travelers looking for a peaceful getaway, with as many as 200,000 visitors in a single year. The traditional rorbu houses, built on poles over water, add a distinctive layer of charm to the town. These cabins were once made for traveling fishermen and have now been refurbished to meet contemporary tastes.

> During the holiday season, poinsettias brighten up homes in suitably festive coloring, serving as symbols of goodwill. December 12 marks National Poinsettia Day, a special occasion to celebrate this holiday favorite. The plant was introduced to the US by Joel Roberts Poinsett, a botanist and former minister to Mexico who died on this day in 1851. Poinsettias can be found growing in the wild from Mexico to Guatemala. The ancestors of the modern, commercially available version have been traced to the Mexican state of Guerrero. The crimson-leaved plant was used by the Aztecs as a red dye and as a fever-reducing medicine.

> The Sahara spans over 3 million square miles of North Africa, covering large parts of various countries including Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Sudan, and Tunisia. Vast sand dunes, rocky plateaus, and occasional oases create a landscape like no other. Although it is the largest hot desert in the world, the Sahara supports drought-resistant plants like acacia and palm trees, and hardy animals such as camels and fennec foxes. Intriguing features include its shifting sand dunes, pictured in today's image, some of which are over 500 feet high. Ancient rock art and fossils have also been discovered here, providing insights into early civilizations and prehistoric creatures. Sandstorms are common, shaping the ever-changing scenery and adding to the mystique of this natural wonder.

> Strap on your hiking boots because it's National Llama Day! December 9 is a designated day to appreciate these intelligent and trainable creatures. You'll need to visit the Andes Mountains to see their wild cousins, guanacos. Guanacos are believed to have originated in the central plains of North America 40 million years ago, but they gradually migrated to South America. Scientists think llamas descended from guanacos and were first domesticated around 4500 BCE.
> 
> As seen in today's image, guanacos are often spotted roaming free in Los Glaciares National Park, Argentina, sporting dark cinnamon-colored wool and cartoonish-looking faces. Cute as they are, they can be a bit rude: Both guanacos and llamas defend themselves by spitting to assert dominance within their herd or to keep intrusive peers at bay. Don't let this deter you from going on an organized llama trek though—they can make for great pack animal companions!
