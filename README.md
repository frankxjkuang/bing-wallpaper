<summary>Description</summary>

> Perched high in the mountains of Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia, the thick-billed raven holds the title of the world's largest raven. At nearly 28 inches in length and weighing more than 3 pounds, it is about a quarter heavier than the common raven. Its enormous, arched bill—pale at the base and close to 3.5 inches long—is the largest among perching birds. These ravens live mostly between 5,000 and 11,200 feet above sea level, found across farmland, rocky cliffs, and even rooftops in mountain towns.
> 
> Thick-billed ravens are versatile feeders, taking carrion, insects, beetle larvae, seeds, and crops like wheat, along with scraps from people. Observers have seen them pulling grubs from dung heaps and even forcing Verreaux's eagle-owls from their nests. Often seen in pairs or small groups, they build large stick nests on cliffs or tall trees, laying three to five bluish-green eggs. Their calls range from deep croaks to wheezy notes, and rare instances of mimicry have been recorded. Their plumage gleams purple in sunlight, a striking figure of the African highlands. Classified as 'least-concern' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the thick-billed raven continues to thrive.

> Nothing says fall like spotting a field full of pumpkins waiting to be picked. These gourds have rolled their way into pies, porches, lattes, and parades, but today they get the spotlight: It's National Pumpkin Day. Some places go all out to show their affection—Morton, Illinois, calls itself the 'Pumpkin Capital of the World,' thanks to its high production and ties to canned pumpkin. New Hampshire follows closely, with pumpkin as its official state fruit.
> 
> Ever wondered why we carve this squash? The tradition comes from an old Irish story about a man called Stingy Jack. According to legend, Jack tricked the Devil multiple times and was denied entry to both heaven and hell, leaving him to wander the Earth with only a carved-out turnip and a glowing coal to light his way. Immigrants brought the tale to America, where pumpkins—larger and easier to carve than turnips—became the canvas for glowing jack-o'-lanterns. The Connecticut field pumpkin is the go-to variety thanks to its size, smooth skin, and bright orange hue. The color of pumpkins comes from beta-carotene, but not all are orange—some grow white, green, or even blue. Their utility doesn't end there—pumpkins have stood guard as scarecrows, been launched in pumpkin-chucking contests, and even hollowed out for boat races. So, have you sharpened your carving tools?

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today, we step into the Martimoaapa Mire Reserve in Finland, where wide, cold-climate wetlands and peatlands stretch across a landscape shaped over thousands of years. This reserve is more than just mires—it carries layers of history. During Finland's Prohibition era (1919–1932), smugglers hauled sacks of liquor from Sweden across these bogs, following a 'spirits' route that passed through Martimoaapa. Parts of that path can still be traced today. Imagine trekking with a heavy pack over soggy ground—would you have made it?
> 
> This is just the beginning. Here, archaeologists have discovered brackish pits once used to store meat, and a mysterious stone circle about 33 feet wide—like something out of a northern myth. Its purpose? Still unknown. More recent history lives on in the Saunasaari sauna, once part of a logging cabin built for men who worked these boreal forests. It gave them warmth, rest, and a place to dry off.
> 
> Wildlife, ever-present, completes the picture. Nearly 100 bird species nest here, from swans and cranes to owls and kestrels. Trails ranging from 1.9 to 8 miles, dotted with huts and campfire sites, invite you to explore—on foot or on skis in winter.

<summary>Description</summary>

> She was never meant to fade away. When the RMS Queen Mary sailed in 1936, she stole the spotlight across the Atlantic—an Art Deco liner that broke speed records and carried celebrities, royalty, and dignitaries. War transformed her from a floating palace into the 'Grey Ghost,' stripped of luxury and loaded with Allied troops. In 1967, after 30 years at sea, she retired to Long Beach, where her decks now serve as hotel corridors, guided exhibits, and a living monument to maritime history.
> 
> But her legend did not dock with her anchors. Over the years, guests and crew have spoken of echoes in empty corridors, footsteps reverberating on metal floors, and the laughter of a child near the deserted pool. Ghost tours highlight these eerie stories, though historians note that deaths aboard were due to natural causes, with no murders ever recorded. Today, the Queen Mary stands as both a heritage landmark and a stage for folklore. So, is she haunted? There are no records confirming it, yet the whispers keep her stories very much alive.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Ever tried spotting a snow leopard in the wild? It's called the 'ghost of the mountains' for a reason—you're more likely to see its pawprints than the big cat itself. But every October 23, the species steps into the spotlight on International Day of the Snow Leopard, a day set aside to protect this elusive predator and its rugged home.
> 
> Snow leopards roam high-altitude ranges across 12 Asian countries, from Afghanistan to China. Their thick coats and long tails are built for survival in freezing, rocky terrain. Yet even these stealthy cats can't hide from threats like poaching, shrinking habitats, and climate change. With fewer than 7,000 left in the wild, conservation is a necessity. The image of a snow leopard mother sheltering her cubs in the rocky cliffs of the Cold Desert Biosphere Reserve in India illustrates what's at stake. That's why governments, conservation groups, and local communities team up to safeguard both the animals and their ecosystems. After all, saving snow leopards also protects water sources and biodiversity for millions of people living downstream: they act as keystone species in their alpine environment, maintaining the ecological balance through predation on herbivores. That prevents overgrazing and protects vegetation that helps retain snowmelt and maintain watershed health.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In Bulgaria, on the western slopes of the Balkan Mountains, the Belogradchik Rocks stand like a natural gallery where every formation tells a tale. Shaped over millions of years by erosion, these sandstone and limestone pillars twist and tower into outlines that locals swear resemble people, animals, and even entire scenes. That's why names like 'The Horseman,' 'The Schoolgirl,' and 'The Monks' have stuck—it's a landscape where spotting shapes feels a bit like playing nature's version of charades.
> 
> The rocks, which are on UNESCO's Tentative List, stretch for more than 18 miles around the town of Belogradchik, their colors shifting from deep red to gold depending on the light. History found a use for them, too. The Belogradchik Fortress, first built by the Romans and later reinforced by Ottomans, leans on the rocks as natural defense. Why build walls when the mountain has already done the heavy lifting? Visitors today come to hike, climb, and photograph the unusual shapes, but they often leave with something extra: stories. The Belogradchik Rocks aren't just formations—they're legends frozen in stone.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Diwali is a vibrant Hindu festival celebrating hope, prosperity, and the triumph of good over evil. It commemorates Prince Rama's victorious return to the kingdom of Ayodhya after defeating the demon king Ravana. The festival also honors the goddess Lakshmi, who is believed to bring wealth and well-being into homes, while some communities worship the goddess Kali. During Diwali, families clean and decorate their homes, exchange sweets, and gather for prayers, creating an atmosphere of joy. Central to the celebration are diyas, small oil lamps whose glowing flames symbolize light overcoming darkness and the promise of new beginnings.
> 
> Experiencing Diwali at the Golden Temple in Amritsar, India, is a spectacular sight to behold. The temple glows with thousands of diyas and fairy lights as devotees celebrate the Sikh festival of Bandi Chhor Divas, which often coincides with Diwali.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
