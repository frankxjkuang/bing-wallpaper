> No doubt your eyes are drawn to the large, silver-bluish leaf in today's photo, but there's a little more to this colorful display. We're on the floor of a Mexican rainforest to examine a large Cecropia leaf and some lobster claw petals. The genus called Cecropia contains some of the most recognizable neotropical trees anywhere, but the roughly 60 different species can be hard to tell apart. All Cecropias grow fast, by tree standards anyway. On average, they'll climb about 2.5 feet per year and under perfect conditions can grow as much as 10 feet in that time, eventually reaching around 60 feet tall. When dried, Cecropia leaves shrivel into a fist-like form which displays interesting patterns and shapes. Not only are Cecropias very popular with animals like sloths, monkeys, and toucans for their fruit and leaves, many species have a symbiotic relationship with Azteca ants. Cecropias provide shelter and food for ants, and the ants in turn defend the trees from plant-eating predators.
> 
> The other striking leaves here are cup-shaped flower petals of the hanging lobster claw plant, or what botanists call the Heliconia rostrata. With its bright colors and distinctive shape, the lobster claw is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for tropical gardens. Gardeners looking to attract birds love the Heliconia because its plentiful nectar draws hummingbirds to its downward-facing flowers. Those same flowers have special recognition in Bolivia as 'patujú,' the national flower, which appears on one of the country's flags.

<summary>Description</summary>

> While not everyone would recognize this as an olive tree, most of us understand the meaning of the phrase 'extending an olive branch,' long known as a gesture of peace and friendship. That sentiment of compassion, harmony, and wisdom is at the heart of UNESCO's World Olive Tree Day, created in 2019 and observed every November 26. The intent of the day is to bring attention to the resolution of conflict worldwide and to the preservation of the olive tree itself, like this one standing in front of the Temple of Concordia in Agrigento, Italy. The well-preserved, Greek Doric temple was built on what is now the south shore of Sicily, around 440 BCE. Olive trees are native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and are cultivated today in places with similar climates, like parts of California and Israel. About 90% of harvested olives are used to make olive oil, the quintessential ingredient in Mediterranean cooking.
> 
> The cultivation of olives is about as old as human civilization itself, as are some of the trees themselves. Although olive trees do not grow very tall, usually no more than 30 feet, they live a very long time. One of the oldest known trees in the world, in Portugal, is believed to be 3,350 years old. Many live for millennia, their trunks growing thick and gnarled, and their branches bearing fruit century after century. As civilizations rise and fall around them, these hardy trees remain resilient and steadfast.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we mark Native American Heritage Day and Month with the imposing pyramid now known as Monks Mound, once the center of a city that rivaled any European city of the age in population. Built by people of the Mississippian culture, construction of Monks Mound began early in the 900s CE in present day southern Illinois. By around 1050 the area had grown into a major hub of commerce and agriculture now known as Cahokia. With a population that may have exceeded 40,000 at its peak, Cahokia was the largest urban center north of the great Mesoamerican cities of Mexico and Central America. In the 13th century, for reasons still debated by scholars, the city began to decline, and it was abandoned around 1350. Excavations in the 19th and 20th century revealed a society far more sophisticated and complex than many had believed existed north of Mesoamerica previously.
> 
> Native American Heritage Month celebrates the rich traditions, languages, and stories of Native American, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and Island communities.  Public schools are encouraged to enhance student understanding of Native Americans by providing classroom instruction focusing on Indigenous history, achievements, and contributions, while many government institutions make efforts to recognize the contributions of the first Americans.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Whether made from scratch or plopped out of a can, your cranberry sauce started in a bog like the one seen here. Cranberry shrubs are planted in beds surrounded by dikes. Once the fruit ripens in the fall, the beds are flooded with water, creating bogs full of submerged shrubs. A harvester machine dislodges the berries, which float to the top of the water. Then they're easily corralled on the surface with flexible booms.
> 
> The very sour cranberries will need to be further processed, with lots and lots of sugar, to be palatable as turkey's best friend on the Thanksgiving table. Cranberries grow wild in the wetlands of North America and were an important food for Native Americans, who used them to make pemmican, a nutritious paste of berries, dried meat, and fat. Today, the US accounts for more than half of commercially grown cranberries in the world.

> The sunflower is an eye-catcher, growing to the sky and brightly singing of summer no matter the time of year. Helianthus annuus is native to the Americas, and its flowering head is actually made up of more tiny flowers that mature into seeds (and, of course, get eaten around the world). But did you know that sunflowers also bring one of nature's mathematical wonders to life?
> 
> The gorgeous sunflower displays its seeds in two spirals that twist and curve in opposite directions, fanning out from the center to the golden petals. If you mapped either of those spirals on a graph, they would closely follow the Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21…), where you add a number to the one before it to get the next number. While the famous spiral formula is attributed to Fibonacci, the 13th-century Italian math whiz, scholars in India described the sequence centuries before him—and they probably weren't the first to figure it out either. But regardless of the origin story, each November 23 (11/23…get it?) we celebrate the infinite series known as the Fibonacci sequence.

> Today we're heading to the Netherlands to visit the red foxes at the Amsterdamse Waterleidingduinen Nature Reserve. This protected area about 8 miles west of Amsterdam is host to not only a diverse assortment of plants and animals, but also hundreds of specially designed sand dunes that help filter rainwater. The Waterleidingduinen ('water supply dunes') have been the source of the city's drinking water since the 19th century.
> 
> Maybe for almost as long, red fox sightings have been common at the Waterleidingduinen. Red foxes are the world's largest foxes and are widespread across the Northern Hemisphere. They stick together with their families, the young often helping to care for the next generation of kits. Not fully content in the woods, red foxes are increasingly colonizing urban areas. It's just the latest move in a long history of foxes sharing the planet with humans, as they appear in the folklore of Native American, Greek, Celtic, and Chinese cultures.

> Finally, after years of planning, building, and controversy, the 2022 World Cup is kicking off in Qatar. It's the biggest event on the international soccer calendar, bringing together the globe's top teams to proudly represent their countries. The prestigious World Cup tournament has been held every four years since 1930, except when WWII derailed it in 1942 and 1946. There will be fierce competition in Qatar as the champion French team seeks to defend their title, with the final scheduled for Qatar National Day, December 18. This is the first World Cup hosted by a country in the Middle East, and it's later in the year than usual due to the hot weather in Qatar.
> 
> Controversy swirled around Qatar 2022 from the get-go. Senior officials in FIFA, soccer's governing body, expressed concerns about corruption in the process of awarding World Cup hosting to Qatar, though an internal investigation didn't prove any violation. Soon Qatar's treatment of the country's invaluable 2 million migrant workers—most from Africa and Asia—was criticized, with groups like Amnesty International citing unethical labor practices. While Qatar enacted new laws to improve worker safety, conditions, and pay due to the international spotlight, Amnesty has stressed that these laws must also be effectively implemented. Perhaps the extent of the reforms will be revealed as soccer fans flood the nation and the TV cameras roll.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
