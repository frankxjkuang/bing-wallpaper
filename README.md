<summary>Description</summary>

> Greetings from tropical Costa Rica! The conical Arenal Volcano rises to an impressive height of 5,437 feet, standing tall above the surrounding rainforest and Lake Arenal, the largest lake in the country. The sleepy mountain roared to life in a massive 1968 eruption that buried about 6 square miles under rocks, lava, and ash and devastated three villages. The last significant volcanic activity there took place in 2010, and the once lava-lit peak is currently dormant. With over 500 species of birds, Arenal Volcano National Park is a must-visit location for birdwatchers. The park is also home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including red brocket deer, pumas, white-faced monkeys, orchids, heliconias, and ferns. Arenal makes for an imposing and beautiful sight, towering over the tropical trees.

> It's time to step into the wild! This year's World Wildlife Day focuses on how advances in digital technology can help to preserve wildlife, for example through research, communication, and DNA analysis. Digital platforms can also be a way to get younger people involved in protecting our planet's animals and plants.
> 
> Today's image shows a leopard perched in the branches of Kruger National Park, South Africa. Leopards are one of the five living species of the genus Panthera, which also includes lions, tigers, jaguars, and snow leopards. Leopards are known for their solitary lifestyle, especially males, who roam their territories almost entirely in seclusion. They are considered vulnerable due to habitat loss, and their numbers are in decline globally. Through conservation efforts and events like World Wildlife Day, hopefully we can turn these trends around.

> When Italy comes to mind, iconic cities like Milan, Rome, and Venice often steal the spotlight. However, on the island of Sicily lies a less famous gem—Modica. It's a city that rose from the rubble of an earthquake in 1693 to become an architectural wonderland of Baroque-style buildings. With fewer than 60,000 inhabitants, this UNESCO World Heritage Site boasts cobbled lanes, echoing with powerful footprints—from prehistoric tribes to the ancient Greeks and Romans to the medieval Arabs and Normans. Landmarks like the San Giorgio Cathedral and San Pietro Church awe visitors with their grandeur, and Modica's famous chocolate, crafted with Aztec-inspired techniques, tempts the palates of food enthusiasts. So, the next time Italy beckons, how about taking the road less traveled to Modica?

<summary>Description</summary>

> Every March, we celebrate Women's History Month, a tribute to the generations of women who have shaped our past and are inspiring our present. Today, let's take a moment to highlight a crucial step that was taken for a more representative democracy—the women's suffrage movement. This image shows a sea of determined faces in a 1915 Manhattan suffrage parade. Pioneers like Susan B. Anthony and Lucy Stone spearheaded this effort, which culminated in the historic 19th Amendment in 1920, which granted women the right to vote. Over a hundred years later, women now hold 28% of seats in Congress, a dramatic leap forward from the past and a reminder of progress still to be made.

> Are you a 'leapling'? No, not like this Eurasian red squirrel; rather, that's the term for anyone born on leap day. A leap year is a calendar oddity that exists because Earth's orbit and our usual year count are slightly out of sync. Earth takes 365.25 days to revolve around the sun. To compensate for those extra 5 hours, February gets an extra day—leap day—every four years. The concept, dating back to the ancient Romans, was refined in the Gregorian calendar, introduced in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII. While the purpose of the day is to keep our year aligned with the solar calendar, it can also serve as an extra day to prepare for spring! Cultures worldwide mark leap days and years with unique customs. In Ireland and Britain, women propose to men, in Greece, marrying during a leap year is said to bring misfortune, and in France, a satirical newspaper is published.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Bamburgh Castle perches on a crag of volcanic rock, overlooking sand dunes and the coast of Northumberland, England. The fortress, once a strategic Anglo-Saxon stronghold, evolved over centuries into the imposing structure seen today. The site was the seat of the ancient Northumbrian kingdom—an early medieval Anglo-Saxon kingdom covering present-day northern England and southeast Scotland. The original castle was destroyed by invading Vikings in 993 and a new castle was built here by the Normans. Today's castle is the result of various restorations in the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries. After surviving its share of attacks, Bamburgh Castle has made its way to the limelight due to its impressive silhouette against the North Sea, featuring in productions like 'Macbeth,' 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,' and 'Ivanhoe.'

It was set up by Polar Bears International, an organization dedicated to protecting these mammals and their habitat. The date was chosen to coincide with the time when cubs are in their dens being protected by their mothers, as this is the most vulnerable time in a polar bear's life.

When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
