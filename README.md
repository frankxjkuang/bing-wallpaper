<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> The Eben Ice Caves only exist during the freezing winters of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. For the rest of the year, there are only sandstone cliffs and cedar trees here. But when temperatures drop, water flows over the canyon cliffs and turns into these beautiful, colorful ice formations.
> 
> Visitors can walk through the space created between the cliffs and the walls of ice that stretch up to 50 feet high. Make sure to bring your crampons or hiking boots and look out for the local wildlife! Only 3% of Michigan's human population lives in the Upper Peninsula, but the area is teeming with bears, moose, wolves and other animals.

> The Great Backyard Bird Count has begun! Time to pay more attention to our feathered friends and help scientists learn about wild bird populations. The event runs over four days and will see people using apps and websites to identify local birds and share their sightings from their backyards, or other favorite spots, for as little as 15 minutes a day.
> 
> Last year, the US had the highest number of participants, followed by India and Canada, with more than 7,000 bird species identified overall from 192 countries. The event, which began in the US in 1998, is sponsored by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, the National Audubon Society, and Birds Canada.
> 
> So, whether you spot an Allen's hummingbird, like the one pictured on our homepage in southern central Mexico, a Northern cardinal, an American crow, or one of thousands of other bird species, your snapshot of local birdlife will be part of something much bigger, helping to track the movements of winter birds worldwide.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Illuminated by the setting sun on Yosemite's famous El Capitan is a rare natural phenomenon known as the 'Firefall,' which appears for just a few weeks a year. From mid to late February, the sun is at just the right angle to set Horsetail Fall aglow, but only if sufficient water is flowing and the sky is clear. Even then, the Firefall only lasts for about 10 minutes in the evening, so vantage points can be very crowded.
> 
> Horsetail Fall is a small, seasonal waterfall fed by rain and snowmelt on the eastern edge of El Capitan, the majestic granite monolith that towers more than 3,000 feet above the valley floor. We hope this year's visitors are lucky enough to see the Firefall, but, if you miss it, there are plenty of other natural wonders to enjoy here in Yosemite National Park.

> It's World Hippo Day, time to celebrate one of Earth's heaviest land animals! These African herbivores are scattered across the continent south of the Sahara Desert but, despite their wide range, hippos are listed as a vulnerable species due to habitat loss. While they spend their lives in and around water, hippos aren't good swimmers and can't float. They move about in deep water by bouncing off the bottom. Hippos can live up to 40 years in the wild and possess the largest mouth of any land animal in the world, so smiling for the camera comes naturally.

In 1982, El Valle de la Luna was declared a nature sanctuary for its stunning, untouched habitat and its peculiar lunar-like terrain.

> Today we're celebrating Darwin Day with this blue-footed booby on the shores of the Galápagos Islands, where the famous naturalist observed wildlife and collected specimens that would inform his theory of evolution.
> 
> The distinctive, bright blue feet of these marine birds are particularly eye-catching, as is their exuberant mating dance. The male struts around showing off the blueness of his feet to prospective mates. These birds often mate for life and recognize their partner by their unique call.
> 
> What about that name? It's said to be derived, rather unkindly, from the Spanish word 'bobo,' which means stupid, as they can be clumsy on land and were easily caught by sailors. They're much more graceful in the air, however, swooping from great heights and plunging into the water at speeds of up to 60 mph to catch small fish to eat.
