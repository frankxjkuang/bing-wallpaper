> The common raven is an intelligent and adaptable bird known for its striking appearance and remarkable behaviors. This elegant bird is easily identified by its characteristic wedge-shaped tail and glossy black feathers. Their keen eyesight and agile flight make them proficient hunters, often scavenging for prey or stealing from other predators. Ravens are known for their playful behavior and their omnivorous diet, feeding on a wide variety of foods, including carrion, insects, and small mammals.
> 
> Revered across various cultures, ravens have frequently appeared in literature and legends. In Edgar Allan Poe's famous poem, 'The Raven,' this bird serves as a symbol of death and melancholy, haunting the protagonist with its ominous refrain of 'nevermore.' Native American folklore often portrays the raven as a cunning and mystical trickster, with some tribes believing it possessed the power to shape-shift. Ravens also feature prominently in Norse mythology where they were considered to be wise messengers of the god Odin.

> Cemeteries are not usually tourist attractions but Bonaventure Cemetery in Savannah, Georgia, defies expectations. The city is often referred to as the most haunted in America, so devotees to all things spooky head here to test their nerves. A cemetery since 1846, the 160-acre site is perched on a bluff overlooking the Wilmington River. Its oak trees, dripping with Spanish moss, loom over walkways, monuments, and elaborate burial vaults. If it sounds like stepping into a southern Gothic novel, you're on the right track: The cemetery featured in John Berendt's 1994 bestseller 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.' Among the famous figures resting here is poet Conrad Aiken, whose grave is mentioned in the novel. His tombstone is a bench, said to have been designed to allow poetry lovers somewhere to sit to enjoy a drink in these soul-stirring surroundings.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In the Spanish town of Consuegra, echoes linger of the adventures of Don Quixote, the hero of Miguel de Cervantes' epic novel. This tourist destination in Castilla-La Mancha is famous for its rocky ridge, known as Cerro Calderico, crowned with 12 white windmills. The windmills are thought to have inspired Cervantes to write the famous scene in which Don Quixote mistakes them for an army of giants. With their stone walls and wooden blades, some date back to the 16th century, when they were built to grind grain.
> 
> Castilla-La Mancha is the third-largest region—after Castile y León and Andalusia—in Spain but one of the least densely populated. The regional capital city, Toledo, has a significant architectural and cultural legacy—including Old Town and the Catedral de Toledo—that led to its designation as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1986. So, for your next quest, let the windmills of Castilla-La Mancha whisper their timeless tales in your ear.

> The enchanting Isle of Skye in Scotland is home to the Sligachan Old Bridge, built by Thomas Telford, a prolific Scottish civil engineer, in the early 1800s. The bridge arches over a river of the same name, and carries only cyclists and pedestrians, while a modern bridge downstream serves cars. From atop the bridge's weathered, mossy stones, travelers can take in the majestic Cuillin Mountains in the distance. According to local tradition, the Sligachan River's water contains a mysterious blessing provided by fairies. Those who dare to immerse their faces in these waters are said to be gifted with timeless beauty.

> The Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument is an untamed wilderness of cliffs and canyons in the heart of southern Utah. The Grand Staircase is a sequence of five majestic sandstone cliffs, rising approximately 5,500 feet across the expanse of the monument. Each step records a different era in Earth's geological history, a vast showcase of changes over 200 million years. Archaeologists have found prehistoric artifacts, petrified wood, and dinosaur fossils which are over 75 million years old. In human history, the Ancestral Puebloan and Fremont people mastered the art of farming in this challenging terrain. They constructed granaries to store and preserve their harvests. Today, it is a popular getaway for nature enthusiasts and travelers seeking adventure.

> Hungary is a country blessed with stunning landscapes and a host of historic castles. From the opulent Buda Castle in Budapest, with its commanding views of the Danube, to Eger Castle, renowned for its heroic defense against the Turks, each site has a story to tell.
> 
> Our homepage image shows one such stronghold, Füzér Castle, which crowns the Zemplén Mountains near Hungary's northern border and dates back to the 13th century. Perched at an elevation of over 1,800 feet above sea level, this castle stands on a mountain of volcanic origin. Here, within its ancient stone walls, the crown of Hungary was hidden following the country's defeat by the Ottoman Empire in the 1526 Battle of Mohács. After years of ruin, the castle's chapel was restored in 2016, and the keep was rebuilt to its former glory.
