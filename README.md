> Playful, strong swimmers, and expert hunters—meet the otters. They come in 13 species of various shapes and sizes, from the sea otters found in coastal waters to the river otters frolicking in freshwater habitats. Seen in today's image is a Eurasian otter on the beautiful Isle of Mull off the west coast of Scotland. With webbed feet, streamlined bodies, and dense fur coats, otters are built for speed and agility underwater. They can dive deep and hold their breath for several minutes.
> 
> From habitat loss and pollution to being hunted for their fur, these whiskered wonders are struggling to survive out in the wild. That's where World Otter Day, on the last Wednesday in May, comes in. It's our chance to raise awareness about the challenges otters face and what we can do to help protect our environment.

> Welcome to the Roussanou Monastery, nestled amidst the towering cliffs of the Meteora rock formation in Thessaly, northern Greece. Roussanou is one of the six monasteries that remain active in this UNESCO World Heritage Site. Despite the construction difficulties, 24 monasteries were founded on these 'columns of the sky' in the 14th and 15th centuries.

> Once you've conquered the climb, you'll be greeted by stunning panoramic views, but the real treasures lie within the monastery itself—a world of Byzantine art and architecture. This style emerged in the Eastern Roman Empire, which lasted from the 4th century CE until the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Are you ready to take the climb?

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today, as we observe Memorial Day, we pay tribute to the courageous individuals who gave their lives to defend our nation and uphold its values. The origins of this day date back to the 1860s, in the years following the Civil War and the first national observance was held in 1868. However, one of the earliest accounts is from October 1864, when three women in Boalsburg, Pennsylvania, placed flowers at the graves of two Union soldiers. They decided to decorate the graves of all the fallen soldiers and returned to do the same the following year.
> 
> While Memorial Day is a moment to remember the sacrifices of our armed forces, it also marks the unofficial beginning of the summer season. The long weekend offers families the perfect opportunity to get together for picnics, barbecues, and beach trips. Memorial Day is a celebration of patriotism, unity, and gratitude and reminds us that freedom is not free.

> Are you looking for sandy charms? Come to Aït Benhaddou, Morocco, on the old caravan route linking the Sahara to Marrakesh. This UNESCO World Heritage Site showcases Moroccan earthen clay architecture, made using sun-dried mud. Although none of the buildings here are believed to predate the 17th century, they are constructed using techniques and styles that are much older. Located on the gentle slopes overlooking the Asif Ounila (Ounila River) the Ksar of Aït Benhaddou is a fortified village, clustered within a defensive wall with corner towers. The ksar's communal landscape includes a public square, a mosque, grain-threshing areas beyond the fortifications, and a caravanserai—a type of roadside inn, among other features. So, if you are seeking a journey off the beaten path, Aït Benhaddou awaits you.

> 
> Today, we know of more than 350 species of turtles, living on all continents except Antarctica. Did you know that these animals originated around 200 million years ago, which means that they are one of the oldest reptile groups on the planet? Or that some species can live up to 150 years? So let's respect and protect these shelled creatures—some of them are older than our grandparents.

When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
