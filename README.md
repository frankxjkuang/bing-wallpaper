> A breathtaking maze of sandstone formations and awe-inspiring views awaits you at Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah. People have lived in this area for at least 10,000 years, including the Anasazi, Pueblo, and Paiute Peoples. The hoodoos—tall, thin spires of rock formed by erosion—in the park inspired Paiute mythology: they believed them to be the Legend People turned to stone by the trickster Coyote.
> 
> The first European Americans arrived in the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and some eventually settled there in the 1850s. Bryce Canyon was named after Ebenezer Bryce, who had a homestead nearby. On this date in 1928, it was declared a national park. These days, the park is famous for its hoodoos. Every year, over 2 million visitors come to marvel at these geological formations. In fact, Bryce Canyon National Park has the highest concentration of hoodoos anywhere on Earth.

> Prepare to be amazed by the giant cuttlefish, known for its mesmerizing ability to transform its appearance in the blink of an eye. This cuttlefish is found in the temperate and subtropical waters of Australia, ranging from Brisbane in Queensland and Shark Bay in Western Australia to as far south as Tasmania.
> 
> Featured here is a group of giant cuttlefish off the coast near Whyalla, South Australia. This species holds the title of being the largest of its kind on Earth. It can reach an impressive mantle length of 20 inches and stretches up to a total length of 40 inches when its tentacles are fully extended. Weighing nearly 25 pounds, this marine heavyweight is as fascinating as it is formidable. Like all cuttlefish, this species has eight arms, two feeding tentacles, three hearts, and blue blood. However, its most spectacular feature is its skin, which is equipped with chromatophores—specialized cells that allow it to change colors and patterns.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Around 60 miles southwest of Tokyo stands one of Japan's cultural icons: Mount Fuji. The country's tallest mountain rises 12,000 feet above the surrounding landscape, with its near-symmetrical cone covered in snow for nearly five months each year. For centuries, Fujisan—as it is known in Japanese—has been worshiped as a sacred mountain. In the Shinto faith, Fuji is deified as Asama no Okami, and shrines dedicated to it are built within sight of the mountain.
> 
> February 23 is celebrated as Mount Fuji Day (富士山の日) because the word 'Fujisan' can be interpreted as '2, 2, 3.' Although it's not a national holiday, people often take the opportunity to learn more about this majestic peak. It's also a day to reflect on the future of the mountain, and how it can be preserved for future generations. Every year, more than 300,000 people climb Mount Fuji, and overtourism has become a real concern.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we are celebrating the anniversary of Gateway National Park, which was established on February 22, 2018, in St. Louis, Missouri. The park, which lies along a picturesque stretch of the Mississippi River, commemorates Thomas Jefferson’s idea of a continental nation. At its heart stands the Gateway Arch, a breathtaking 630-foot-tall structure that has become the ultimate symbol of St. Louis. Constructed of stainless steel, it holds the distinction of being the world's tallest arch and Missouri's tallest accessible structure. Finnish American architect Eero Saarinen dreamed up the design back in 1947, and by October 28, 1965, his vision had been brought to life. The arch's futuristic design has long been viewed as a symbol of the automobile era, representing the modern, urban landscape, and the promise of a technologically advanced future.

> From waterfalls to temples, Shivamogga, in the South Indian state of Karnataka, offers experiences waiting to be discovered. Steeped in timeless lore, the city is mentioned in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, epics composed as poems and set in the ancient Hindu kingdoms of India. The region's name itself holds a spiritual significance, derived from the Sanskrit words 'Shiva-Mukha,' meaning the 'face of Shiva,' the Hindu god. It is home to several temples, including the Sharavati Temple, dedicated to Shiva, and a temple in the Kodachadri hills that offers vistas of the Western Ghats mountain range.
> 
> Adding to this landscape is Champaka Sarasi, the monumental pond featured in today's image. It tells a story far beyond its waters. It was built by Venkatappa Nayaka, a member of the Nayakas of Keladi, an important ruling dynasty of early modern Karnataka. The pond was constructed in memory of the king's beloved wife, Champaka. It also has a small stone temple at its center, housing a Shiva linga, an abstract or non-figurative depiction of Shiva. Shivamogga is also renowned for its waterfalls, including Jog Falls, the second-highest plunge waterfall in India.

> Born on this day in 1902, Ansel Adams remains one of the most celebrated photographers in history, renowned for his striking black-and-white images of the American wilderness. His work immortalized the grandeur of national parks like California's Yosemite, pictured here, showcasing the raw beauty of nature with depth and clarity. A pioneer of 'pure photography,' Adams believed in capturing a scene's natural essence without manipulation, a principle he championed through his development of the Zone System—a technique to control exposure and contrast.
> 
> Adams initially aspired to be a concert pianist, but his love for the outdoors—sparked by a family trip to Yosemite in 1916—set him on a path that would redefine landscape photography. Beyond his art, Adams was a passionate environmentalist. His work often served as visual arguments for the preservation of America's wild places. He also played a crucial role in expanding the National Park system, advocating for the establishment of Kings Canyon National Park in California. Adams' legacy continues to inspire photographers and environmentalists alike, reminding us of the power of art to drive change.

> The European river otter is more than just an adorable face in the wild. Found across Europe, Asia, and parts of northern Africa, these otters thrive in clean rivers, lakes, and wetlands, serving as an important indicator of environmental health. They are built for agility, with streamlined bodies, webbed feet, and dense fur that keeps them warm even in icy waters. A single square inch of their fur can hold more than 400,000 hairs, making it one of nature's most effective insulators. River otters were once endangered due to pollution and habitat loss. Thanks to conservation efforts, their populations are rebounding in many regions across Europe.
> 
> Otters are naturally playful, often sliding down snowy or muddy banks and diving underwater to find pebbles to play with. They communicate using a repertoire of whistles, squeaks, and even scent, which also helps them mark their territorial boundaries. If you find yourself near a serene river in their range, keep an eye out—you might just spot one of these elusive river-dwellers.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
