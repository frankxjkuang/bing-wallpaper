<summary>Description</summary>

> Crete is the largest and most populous of all the Greek islands, and also the farthest from the mainland (in fact, it's just about halfway to Turkey). This big little island is small enough to drive across in a few hours but full of wonders, from mountain ranges to gorges to beautiful beaches. Take this jewel box of turquoise water near the port city of Chania, for example. Set on the easternmost of three peninsulas that stick out like horns from the northwest shoreline of Crete, Seitan Limania is one of the most photographed beaches on the island.
> 
> Seitan Limania is beautiful to behold from a distance but driving up close via the narrow switchback roads takes some nerve. And once you get to the parking lot, the rocky hike down is for only the most surefooted of beachgoers. On your way down, you'll likely meet some of the goats that populate the area. The narrow cove is flanked by steep rock walls that zig one way, then zag the other. When you reach the beach, you'll find yourself on one of the most beautiful spots on any coast—and a selfie here at Seitan Limania is hard to beat for bragging rights.

> Wildlife crossing in Wierden, Netherlands (© Frans Lemmens/Alamy)

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> It's not just chickens that cross the road. Wild creatures from frogs to elk roll the dice with death when they need to traverse the thousands of highways humans have threaded through wildlife habitat. Sadly, the dice don't fall favorably for millions of animals each year, and collisions with vehicles often cause fatalities for both them and the drivers who hit them.
> 
> Many countries now construct wildlife crossings—also called green bridges, ecoducts, natuurbrugs (like this one in Wierden in the Netherlands), and écoponts (in France). These can be either overpasses or underpasses, and they are an expensive venture. Are they worth it? Well, officials in Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada, would say categorically yes. Over 20 years they built 44 bridges and underpasses so wildlife could cross the Trans-Canada Highway, which divides the park; traffic accidents involving wildlife dropped by 80%.
> 
> France built the first overland wildlife crossings in the 1950s and continues to invest in many elaborate safe passageways. But the Netherlands leads the initiative, with an impressive 600-plus wildlife crossings, and counting. In fact, the Dutch can claim the honors for the world's longest animal crossing too—the Natuurbrug Zanderij Crailoo is an overpass that's half a mile long and 55 yards wide. Now chickens and their four-legged friends can cross the road anytime, no questions asked.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In shallow areas of the tropical Indo-Pacific, you'll come across the blue linckia sea star. Oftentimes it's found anchored to or hiding under rocks. This duo was spotted near the coast of New Ireland, an island in Papua New Guinea. Even though 'blue' is in the name, this species of sea star has also been observed in purple, pink, or orange. The vibrant colors make the linckia popular in the seashell trade, unfortunately, and intensive poaching has diminished their populations. But new research could lead to calls for their protection: Scientists have studied potential anti-tumor and antibacterial properties inherent to the blue linckia.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This idyllic road is a path to one of Italy's magnificent natural gifts. Just outside of the ancient city of Pisa in Tuscany is the Regional Park of Migliarino, San Rossore, Massaciuccoli. This immense and diverse park boasts numerous distinct environments. A visitor will discover, by turns, seaside sand dunes, marshlands, and vast forests of pine, oak, and elm. A wide array of birds can also be found in the park, along with ample wild boar, rabbits, red foxes, and the impressively antlered fallow deer. It's even been suggested that there are wolves living in the deep reaches of the woods.
> 
> While the park is popular for its beaches, forests, and wildlife, it offers cultural attractions as well. There are Roman ruins to be explored here, along with working farms, and environmental education opportunities. It's also home to the Villa del Gombo, once an official residence of the president of Italy. The villa was built in the 1950s on the site of a ruined old hunting lodge once owned by the Royal House of Savoy. Today the facility hosts conferences and tourists.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> The Baltic Sea in northeast Europe is a peculiar body of water, combining the characteristics of a sea with those of a lake and an estuary, too. Strictly speaking, it is in fact a sea and thus appropriately named, joined to the Atlantic Ocean through three straits in Denmark: the Öresund, Great Belt, and Little Belt. Technically, the Baltic is classified as a brackish sea, meaning it is not entirely fresh and not entirely saline. The Baltic Sea isn't landlocked, but it does border many countries, including Russia, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia—and it's the Estonian coast featured in today's image.
> 
> Like a lake, the Baltic is relatively shallow with an average depth of 150 feet. Its salinity is so low it nearly qualifies as a freshwater sea. That's because hundreds of rivers and streams empty into the sea, and more fresh water falls on the sea in the form of rain and snow than evaporates. The Baltic can also be described as a giant estuary, into which flow several major rivers. Sailors favor the Baltic because there is very little current and tide to contend with, and even when surface winds pick up, the seas remain relatively calm. Easy to navigate, gateway to so many lands, the Baltic has been integral to trade and commerce—and inevitable conflict—in the region for centuries. It has been known by many names, proof the Baltic is a true meeting place.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Flevoland, the 12th and newest province in the Netherlands, has only been around since 1986. Not only was it not established until this late date, but before the mid-20th century, much of the land here simply didn't exist. Flevoland was created through vast land reclamation projects in the 1950s and '60s. While the Dutch had been reforming their landscape to meet their changing needs for hundreds of years, the 20th century would see their most dramatic and ambitious projects realized. The province's anthem is the fitting 'Waar Wij Steden Doen Verrijzen' ('Where We Let Cities Arise'). It's an ode to pushing back the sea and creating a 'province that's not bad, youngest part of the Netherlands. Where it is nice to live, my beloved Flevoland!'
> 
> With its landscape of bogs, marshes, and swamps, Flevoland is a perfect nesting ground for these bearded reedlings. The reedlings are sometimes referred to as bearded tits, due to their passing resemblance to the long-tailed tit, but not only are they not tits, they don't really have beards either (though the males have something closer to a mustache). Found across Eurasia, the bearded reedling is considered a unique songbird, with no other living species closely related to it.

<summary>Description</summary>

> We're standing on the Boundary Trail at Johnston Ridge in the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument. This view of the volcano shows how the eruption of Mount St. Helens on May 18, 1980, ripped apart the once-conical summit, forever changing the Washington landscape. Forty years ago today, 110,000 acres within Gifford Pinchot National Forest were set aside to memorialize the deadliest and most destructive volcanic eruption in the United States.
> 
> President Ronald Reagan established the monument to preserve the area for research, recreation, and education. Left to recover naturally from the eruption, the land has been open to recreational users since 1986. Though scientists believe that Mount St. Helens will erupt again sometime in the next few centuries, hikers and climbers are undeterred.

> Solar Impulse 2 was the second aircraft built by Swiss aviators André Borschberg and Bertrand Piccard. Borschberg is an engineer by training, Piccard a psychiatrist and balloonist who copiloted the first balloon to fly around the world nonstop. The pair took turns piloting the aircraft, which can carry only one person, on a multi-leg, 16-month flight around the world that started and ended in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.
> 
> This image was taken during the final leg from Egypt to Abu Dhabi as Solar Impulse 2 flew over the Great Pyramids of Giza. The superlight plane was powered by thousands of solar cells mounted atop its fuselage and jumbo-jet sized wings. Batteries stored energy so it could fly at night. The going was slow by the standards of modern jet travel—Solar Impulse 2 flew at an average speed of 50 mph. Clearly, solar-powered flight on a commercial scale is still many years away, but as this photo shows, its Kitty Hawk moment is in the books.
