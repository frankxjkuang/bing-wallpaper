> Walk through a real-life canvas where vibrant blossoms paint the Earth in the shadow of Mount Vernon. That's exactly what awaits you at the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival in Washington. Founded in 1984 by the Mount Vernon Chamber of Commerce, it began as a three-day event but has since grown into a month-long fiesta. The festival runs from April to May and draws visitors from all over the world. The floral show spans multiple gardens in the valley, so make sure you explore Tulip Town, Tulip Valley Farms, Garden Rosalyn, and the 50-acre display at RoozenGaarde. You can tour the tulip gardens by bicycle and explore the local wineries, breweries, and restaurants. Among the petals, life slows down just enough for us to remember the simple joys—breathe deeply, smile widely, and revel in the spectacle that is the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival.

> Put on your solar glasses and turn your eyes skyward. Today, you can witness a rare celestial event—a total solar eclipse! As the moon perfectly aligns between the Earth and the sun, daylight will shift eerily to twilight. The total solar eclipse will be visible across North America, from Mazatlán, Mexico, to eastern Canada's Newfoundland Island, for up to four and a half minutes between 10:57 AM PST and 4:47 PM ADT. It will be the first total solar eclipse visible in the continental United States since August 21, 2017, although one occurs somewhere on Earth approximately every 18 months. Astronomers study the sun's corona, which is the outermost part of its atmosphere, its magnetic fields, and the behavior of Earth's atmosphere during the eclipse. Keep an eye on the time today and find a good spot to put on eclipse-safe solar glasses and see the golden ring emerge.

> Known as nature's engineers, beavers have been shaping the world for millions of years. Historically, North American beavers faced challenges from humans. They were hunted for their fur, and their 'nuisance' freshwater abodes were destroyed. However, these buck-toothed, paddle-tailed dam builders have been gaining new respect in recent years. These animals have beneficial effects not only on water quality but also on land. With their iron-coated orange incisors, beavers fell trees, diligently constructing not just homes but habitats. Their dams create life-sustaining wetlands for countless species. Meanwhile, their lodges are masterpieces of security and comfort, the entrance strategically submerged to deter predators and provide privacy. The rodents have no trouble getting in, as they can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes. So, 'woodn't' it be nice to give a shout-out to these creatures on International Beaver Day?

> From Strawberry Day to Cat Day and even Vegetable Day, Japan has a list of faux holidays, which are the clever results of 'dajare' or word plays. Today's date, April 6, makes up the Japanese word for castle, 'shiro' from 'shi' (4) and 'ro' (6). Hence, the celebration of castles. What better opportunity than Castle Day, to learn about the country's largest and most-visited castle, Himeji Castle? Dating back to 1333, this UNESCO World Heritage Site boasts an advanced defensive design and five National Treasure structures. The castle has also withstood time and nature's fury, surviving the bombings of World War II and the Great Hanshin earthquake in 1995. Nearly 700 years of glory, local legends, and ghost stories reverberate through the 83 rooms of this hilltop fortress. Would you care to explore?

> With their elegant leaps and graceful movements, lechwe are the epitome of agility and poise on the African savanna. These antelopes, known for their distinctive reddish-brown coats and lyre-shaped horns, are native to the wetlands and floodplains of south-central Africa, including the Okavango Delta in Botswana, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Lechwe are social animals, often found in herds of thousands. In the heart of the delta, they are an integral part of the region's rich biodiversity, coexisting with other species like elephants, lions, rhinos, and hippos, wading through the water. Their presence adds to the delta's natural allure, which draws in thousands of safari enthusiasts, and is proof of wildlife's resilience in the face of environmental challenges.
