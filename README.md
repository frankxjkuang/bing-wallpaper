<summary>Description</summary>

> Today, on the anniversary of D-Day, we reflect on one of the most defining moments in modern history. On June 6, 1944, over 156,000 Allied troops landed on the beaches of Normandy, France, launching Operation Overlord, also known as D-Day. This complex assault, involving coordinated air, sea, and land forces, marked the beginning of the campaign to liberate Western Europe from Nazi control.
> 
> One of the key sites was Arromanches-les-Bains, pictured here. Though not among the initial landing beaches, this quiet coastal town became vital in the days that followed. It was here that the Allies built Mulberry harbor B, a massive, temporary port assembled in record time to offload troops, vehicles, and supplies. In the months after D-Day, more than 2.5 million men and 500,000 vehicles landed at Arromanches. Remnants of the harbor still lie offshore, a symbol of the ingenuity and planning behind the operation. Arromanches is also home to the Musée du Débarquement, the first museum dedicated to D-Day and the Battle of Normandy, a place where history lives on through stories of courage and resilience.

<summary>Description</summary>

> A global shoutout to the planet we all call home. On World Environment Day, the world hits pause to reflect and act for a greener future. Led by the United Nations Environment Programme, this day has been observed annually on June 5 since 1973. This year, hosted by the Republic of Korea, the event focuses on ending plastic pollution. Plastic contamination has crept into every part of the world—from oceans and forests to our own bodies in the form of microplastics. This year's campaign aims to spark change at every level of society.
> 
> And that brings us to today's image, a mural that's turning heads and making a difference in Guatire, Venezuela. Local artist Oscar Olivares created one of the world's largest eco-murals, made entirely from plastic bottle caps. The over 4,000-square-foot artwork is made of 400,000 bottle caps and depicts two blue macaws spreading their wings across a once-plain cement wall. Children, seniors, and everyone in between rolled up their sleeves to glue caps, piece by piece, converting waste into something meaningful. Through this project, Olivares not only crafted something beautiful, but also sparked conversations about sustainability and showed people the power of collective action. Because sometimes, a big change starts with something as small as a bottle cap.

> The island of Sardinia in Italy, with its rugged cliffs, secret beaches, and endless shades of blue, is undeniably a Mediterranean treasure. On the island's eastern coast lies Cala Luna, featured here—a beach in the Gulf of Orosei. Rising at the mouth of Rio Illune, this beach is at the end of the Codula di Luna canyon. It is a haven of golden sand, surrounded by white cliffs that rise more than 950 feet into the sky—perfect for rock climbing.
> 
> Here, the waters are shallow at first, before deepening into clear depths ideal for snorkeling, diving, and fishing. In the local Nuoro dialect, the word for 'luna,' Italian for 'moon', is rendered as 'elune,' a name that perfectly captures the essence of the beach's crescent shape.

> If there's one place that brings the cycling spirit to life, it's the Netherlands. For World Bicycle Day, today's image captures bicycles lined up on a bridge in the Dutch city of Utrecht. More than half the journeys around the city happen on bikes, surpassing cars and other modes of travel. Nearly everyone lives within 15 minutes of essentials—and over 90% of residents can reach key places in just 10 minutes. This wasn't always the case. It was only in the 1970s, sparked by an oil crisis, rising car-related issues, and strong social movements, that the Netherlands started prioritizing bikes over cars. Since then, cities have embraced bike-friendly streets, dedicated lanes, and traffic lights for cyclists. And thanks to the famously flat landscape, cycling here feels as natural as walking.

> This year, the first week of June marks National Garden Week—a time to celebrate the joy of gardening and the beauty it brings to our lives. Gardening not only connects us to nature but also boosts our mental health and physical well-being. Just spending time outdoors provides Vitamin D from the sun, which helps our bones stay strong and supports a healthy immune system.
> 
> Pictured here is a skipper butterfly taking a break from its quick, darting flight on a coneflower in New York's Rockefeller State Park Preserve. Native to North America, coneflowers and other members of the Echinacea genus are loved by both gardeners and pollinators for their hardy blooms and spiky centers. Whether you plant a few flowers or create a whole garden, this week is a perfect opportunity to get your hands in the dirt and enjoy the simple pleasures of nature.

> 'Life under the sea is better than anything they got up there,' Sebastian the crab once told Ariel. But are we doing enough to protect that underwater world? On June 1, we celebrate World Reef Awareness Day, a time to recognize the beauty—and fragility—of coral reef ecosystems. One magnificent example is the New Caledonian barrier reef, which wraps around Grande Terre, New Caledonia's largest island. At over 930 miles long, it's one of the longest continuous barrier reefs in the world. Its vast 9,300-square-mile lagoon is home to over 2,300 fish species, endangered dugongs, green sea turtles, and migrating humpback whales.
> 
> Reefs like this face growing threats—from pollution, mining runoff, rising ocean temperatures, and even harmful chemicals in some sunscreens. Increased tourism can also strain these fragile ecosystems. This World Reef Awareness Day, commit to reef-friendly choices: use reef-safe sunscreen, reduce plastic waste, and support conservation efforts in your community or online.

> Discover Knuthöjdsmossen, a nature reserve that covers almost 250 acres near the city of Hällefors, Sweden. This tranquil haven features a boardwalk that meanders through a bog, showcasing several small lakes, sand dunes, marshes, and pines.
> 
> The landscape is shaped by the last inland ice that melted around 10,000 years ago, leaving behind moraine and glacial river sand. The reserve's largest sand dune is the 33-foot-tall Stora Hälleforsdynen. The sand dunes are home to many unique insects. A particularly rare gray ant, Formica cinerea, is present in this area. Birdwatchers will be delighted by the diverse avian population, including the red-throated diver, northern lapwing, green sandpiper, and common goldeneye.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
