> It's time to go wild—responsibly! Today is National Wildlife Day. Let's celebrate the incredible animals that roam, fly, swim, and slither across our planet. It's also a day to honor the work of wildlife sanctuaries, conservationists, and endangered species programs that protect our most vulnerable creatures.
> 
> Among the most iconic of these is the grizzly bear, a symbol of the American wilderness. Young grizzlies like these cubs in Alaska's Katmai National Park often 'play-fight' to build strength, sharpen skills, and establish social bonds. These heavyweight champs can weigh up to 900 pounds and still sprint faster than most humans (up to 35 mph). Once widespread across the western United States, grizzlies now primarily roam Alaska and parts of the Northern Rockies. National Wildlife Day reminds us that keeping their wild spaces safe is key to their survival—and ours. So today, let's honor the wild, protect what's precious, and maybe growl a little in solidarity.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The Wilderness Act of 1964, passed 61 years ago today, established the legal definition of wilderness in the United States. Its purpose was to preserve areas 'where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man.' This landmark legislation created the National Wilderness Preservation System, protecting millions of acres from development, roads, and mechanized use.
> 
> Among the most iconic areas protected under this act is the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in northeastern Minnesota. Spanning over one million acres, it is a vast expanse of interconnected lakes, rivers, and boreal forests. The landscape is a mosaic of glacially carved waterways, rocky outcrops, and dense woodlands, offering a haven for moose, wolves, loons, and countless other species. With over 1,200 miles of canoe routes and more than 2,000 campsites, it provides a rare opportunity for solitude and immersion in nature. The Wilderness Act laid the foundation for safeguarding places like the Boundary Waters, ensuring they remain wild and untouched for future generations to experience and cherish.

> At first glance, it looks like a surreal art installation: dark trees frozen on a clay pan, backed by sand dunes and a glowing sky. But this scene from Deadvlei, in Namibia's Namib-Naukluft Park, is entirely natural. The name 'Deadvlei' means 'dead marsh'—a remnant of the wetland that once filled this basin.
> 
> Centuries ago, a river sustained this patch of life. Then the dunes shifted, cutting off the flow. The camel thorn trees that once grew here didn't collapse or vanish. The extreme aridity and high salt content in the soil stopped the natural process in its tracks. Under those conditions, even decay gave up. The trees were embalmed by the desert—sun-dried, rigid, and rooted in place for up to 900 years. Deadvlei's power lies not only in its stark beauty but in its quiet defiance. These trees, no longer alive yet not fully gone, remain like permanent witnesses in a place that chose stillness over erasure.

<summary>Description</summary>

> May 1915: Chicago buzzes with energy. Streetcars pass brick buildings, shop signs catch the morning light, and the city moves with purpose. But today, something different takes over the streets. The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, just months old, march in rows as sharp as the suits they craft. This isn't a quiet debut—it's a statement.
> 
> Formed by tailors and factory workers who broke away from more cautious unions, the Amalgamated brought together recent immigrants, skilled hands, and people tired of 14-hour shifts. In this parade, they're not behind machines—they're out front, holding banners high and showing what collective strength looks like.
> 
> Labor Day became a national holiday in 1894, but by 1915, it was still evolving—part celebration, part protest. Originally created to honor workers' contributions amid demands for fair wages, safer conditions, and shorter workdays, today, it's marked by barbecues, marches, sales, and one last summer break. It's a pause in the calendar that reminds us why time off matters—and a nod to those who keep the country moving.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Long before GPS, natural landmarks like Scotts Bluff rose high above the prairie, signaling to travelers that they were on the right path heading west. Before Gering became a town in 1887 and decades before Nebraska achieved statehood in 1867, these sandstone and siltstone formations were already guiding thousands along the Oregon, California, and Mormon Trails. Scotts Bluff National Monument is named after Hiram Scott, a fur trader with the Rocky Mountain Fur Company who died under mysterious circumstances nearby in the 1820s.
> 
> Today, the nearly 3,000-acre monument includes two main bluffs—Scotts Bluff to the north and South Bluff. It also protects five prominent outcroppings: Dome Rock, Eagle Rock, Crown Rock, Saddle Rock, and Sentinel Rock. At ground level, mule deer graze alongside black-tailed prairie dogs, while coyotes prowl and short grasses ripple in the wind. Higher up, the landscape shifts, spiny yuccas and hardy shrubs cling to rocky slopes, and bighorn sheep navigate the cliffs with ease. Though the wagons are long gone, Scotts Bluff still stands as a guide through both history and terrain.

<summary>Description</summary>

> If you've never seen a nearly 40-foot, polka-dotted fish gliding past coral reefs, you are missing out. Today is International Whale Shark Day, a reminder that these slow-motion giants need our attention. First observed in 2008, the day is used by researchers and marine advocates to spotlight conservation efforts and threats like vessel strikes, plastic pollution, and unregulated tourism.
> 
> Whale sharks are the biggest fish in the sea, but don't let the word 'shark' fool you. They're plankton-eating giants with no interest in humans. Found in warm waters from the Maldives and Mozambique to Mexico's Yucatán coast, they often show up in food-rich, calm waters. Their mouths can stretch over four feet wide, but they feed by suction, not biting. Each has a unique pattern of white spots and stripes—no two alike—used by researchers to track individuals. Their breeding patterns remain largely a mystery, but they are ovoviviparous, meaning pups hatch inside the mother before being born alive. On a day like today, their story reminds us how much ocean life remains a mystery and how vital it is to protect what we already know is at risk.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Seen from above, the uniform arcades and tiled rooftops of Plaza Mayor in Madrid—the capital of Spain—create a captivating architectural harmony. Once the site of a bustling market square known as the Plaza del Arrabal, this historic space has witnessed the city's transformation over the centuries. The shift began in 1561, when the plaza came under Madrid's jurisdiction after the royal court moved from Toledo. Inspired by a vision of order and grandeur, King Philip II reimagined the square—though construction did not actually begin until 1617, under the reign of Philip III.
> 
> Featuring a rectangular layout, the plaza is framed by three-story buildings with 237 inward-facing balconies. It has 10 entrances, nine of which are gated. At its center stands the equestrian statue of Philip III, added in 1848. Over the years, the square has hosted everything from local festivities and bullfights to beatifications and royal ceremonies. Today, it remains a vibrant gathering place, featuring Easter drum parades, outdoor concerts, an annual Christmas market, and a Sunday morning market for stamp and coin collectors.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
