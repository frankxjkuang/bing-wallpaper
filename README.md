> In 1991, logger Hồ Khanh stumbled upon something big in what is now Vietnam's Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park. During a jungle expedition, he found the entrance to a cave with a roaring underground river. It was later named Hang Sơn Đoòng, or 'cave of the mountain river' and in 2009, the British Cave Research Association led an expedition to explore it. They realized something incredible: It was the world's largest cave. Hang Sơn Đoòng's main passage is 3.1 miles long, 490 feet wide, and 660 feet high. That's tall enough to fit a 40-story skyscraper.
> 
> Inside the cave, there is a 200-foot calcite barrier called the 'Great Wall of Vietnam' and stalagmites stretching as tall as 260 feet. It even has its own weather system; clouds form inside due to temperature differences between the cave air and the outside air. Moreover, an underground river links Hang Sơn Đoòng to the nearby Hang Thung cave, suggesting undiscovered depths. Given its fragile ecosystem, strict regulations are in place to preserve Hang Sơn Đoòng's pristine condition. Tours of the cave are limited to 1,000 visitors per year.

> From mythology to movies, lizards have often been portrayed as scary reptiles. But they're not as dangerous as stories might lead you to believe. World Lizard Day is the perfect time to learn about these cold-blooded creatures. With more than 7,000 species, lizards have adapted to a wide range of environments—from deserts to rainforests. Take geckos—these little climbers have toe pads that let them scale walls and walk on ceilings. Then there are chameleons with their color-changing skin. While many think it's all about blending in, this ability is also used to communicate and regulate temperature.
> 
> Now let's focus on the peculiar creature in today's image, trekking across the arid landscape of Australia's Watarrka National Park. Meet the thorny devil, also known as the thorny dragon or moloch. With clever hydrophilic skin that channels moisture to its mouth, this reptile can hydrate just from the dew on its body. This allows it to thrive in extreme desert conditions where others would perish. On World Lizard Day, let's take a moment to appreciate these scaly wonders of the animal kingdom.

> Get ready to celebrate elephants, the largest living land animals. There are three elephant species alive today: African bush, African forest, and Asian. All three species are endangered, and World Elephant Day is dedicated to highlighting the challenges they face, like the ivory trade and habitat loss.
> 
> Today's image features a herd of African elephants roaming the vast expanses of Amboseli National Park in Kenya. Elephants live in groups made up of several families led by a matriarch, an older female elephant, while males leave to live alone or in bachelor herds.
> 
> Thanks to conservation work and the support of the Maasai people, Amboseli is one of the best places in Africa to view large herds, against the dramatic backdrop of Mount Kilimanjaro.

> Discover the beauty of Vancouver Island, Canada. The wooden pathway in today's image, surrounded by ancient pine and cedar trees, leads to Kennedy Lake, the largest freshwater body on the island. The lake covers a surface area of 16,000 acres. It is part of the ancestral lands of the Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation where the Clayoquot and Kennedy Rivers meet. Tofino, over 24 miles away, has a real surf vibe. This small coastal town is a sanctuary for hikers, bird watchers, artists, and dreamers. Famous for its mild winters and pleasant summers, it has been a filming location for movies like 'The Twilight Saga: New Moon' and 'One Week.'

<summary>Description</summary>

> California's Joshua Tree National Park has a history that began way before it was made a national monument on August 10, 1936. Located where the Mojave and Colorado Deserts meet, it has been home to various cultures for thousands of years. Its earliest known residents were people from the Pinto Culture, who lived here from 8000 to 4000 BCE. Centuries later, this land was inhabited by the native Cahuilla, Serrano, and Chemehuevi peoples. The park's namesake, the Joshua tree, grows in a landscape covering 1,242 square miles. Despite their name, they are not really trees, but rather a kind of succulent. Native to southwest US and northern Mexico, they can grow up to 40 feet tall.
> 
> Today, Joshua Tree National Park invites adventurers to explore its terrain. Whether it's hiking through Hidden Valley, visiting the Cholla Cactus Garden, or marveling at Skull Rock, this national park has a lot to offer. By night, it becomes a stargazer's paradise, as seen in today's image. Whether you seek adventure or a moment of tranquility, Joshua Tree awaits with open skies.

> Today we are celebrating the heritage and culture of native populations worldwide. There are some 5,000 Indigenous cultures in 90 countries around the world, from Samoa and Greenland to New Zealand and Nepal. One of the major challenges they face is the loss of their languages: It's estimated that of the 4,000 Indigenous languages in the world, around 2,600 are in danger of becoming extinct.
> 
> In the city of Cusco, Peru, the stone walls of Sacsayhuamán, seen in today's image, murmur tales of the mighty Inca civilization. The Quechua word Sacsayhuamán means 'the place where the hawk is satisfied.' The citadel's walls, which extended over 1,000 feet, were built in the 15th century CE. The boulders used to make them were carved and placed without mortar. After the Inca Empire was defeated at a battle here in 1536, Sacsayhuamán was dismantled by the Spanish and the rest of the structure was covered in earth. It was rediscovered in 1934 when the site was excavated. On this day, let's learn the importance of preserving Indigenous cultures and wisdom, as we honor the Indigenous peoples.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
