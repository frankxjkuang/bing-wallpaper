> Picture 21 square miles of open land, wildlife on the move, and a stag flaunting its crown of antlers. In 1909, husband and wife Anton Kröller and Helene Kröller-Müller began building a private estate in Gelderland, Netherlands—what we now know as De Hoge Veluwe National Park. Their vision? To merge art and nature. They brought it to life by placing artwork within the landscape, like 'Three Upright Motives' by English sculptor Henry Moore in the Pampelse Zand and the President Steyn stone bench by Belgian architect Henry van de Velde, among others.
> 
> Today, the park's forests, woodlands, sand dunes, and heathlands shelter wild boar, roe deer, mouflon, wolves, and countless birds. Yet red deer stags steal the show. Adult males weigh 350 to 530 pounds and stand about 40 to 50 inches at the shoulder. They graze on grass, leaves, and shoots, but also won't say no to fruit or acorns. During the rut, stags display their antlers and bellow to claim territory. They may not travel far, but their search for food and mates keeps the park alive with movement.

> Think Thanksgiving weekend is just about turkey and leftovers? Think again—today is Native American Heritage Day. Established in 2009, it celebrates the voices, art, and achievements of Indigenous peoples across the United States. This day is a reminder to look beyond parades and sales and learn from the experiences of those who first shaped this land. Communities host cultural events, storytelling sessions, and feasts featuring dishes like Three Sisters soup, wild rice, pemmican, beans, squash, and buffalo stew—each carrying centuries of legacy.
> 
> Among the many traditions that shine today is the concho belt. Developed by Navajo artisans in the late 1860s, these belts combine skill and style. Originally made from Mexican silver pesos melted down and formed into ingots, they are now also crafted from nickel silver or German silver. The oval discs are stamped with designs that often represent natural elements like water, the sun, or butterflies, and some are adorned with turquoise stones. More than a fashion accessory, they are symbols of identity—stories worn proudly and passed down through generations like treasured heirlooms.

> The wild turkey's iridescent plumage, seen here at Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in Texas, isn't just striking—it carries the shimmer of history. Today is Thanksgiving, when many Americans gather around the table, enjoying roast turkey stuffed with savory bread dressing, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, and pumpkin pie. Football games hum in the background, parades march down city streets, and kitchens buzz with the familiar aromas of holiday cooking.
> 
> Accounts trace Thanksgiving back to 1621, when the Wampanoag people, the Indigenous stewards of the region, shared a meal with English settlers in Plymouth, Massachusetts and helped them survive their first harsh year. Yet the practice of giving thanks through feasting stretches much further back. Across North America, Indigenous communities held seasonal gatherings to honor the land, harvest, and social bonds—often including wild turkeys on the menu, long before the Pilgrims arrived.
> 
> Thanksgiving became a national holiday in 1863, proclaimed by President Lincoln amid the Civil War as a call for unity. Today, let's savor each bite, recognize the hands and labor that brought it to our plates, and embrace the rich histories intertwined in this tradition.

> Ancient yet vibrant, twisted yet resilient, olive trees can live for over a thousand years. Even when scarred or hollowed, their trunks still send out fresh leaves each season—a living record of survival through drought, wind, and fire. In 2019, UNESCO established November 26 as World Olive Tree Day, recognizing these trees that have been cultivated by humans since about 6,000 BCE. Olives have carried both practical and symbolic weight through the ages: their oil was pressed for anointing, medicine, and daily sustenance; crowns of their leaves graced Olympic victors; and their branches became a lasting emblem of peace.
> 
> Nestled in the Balearic Sea, the Spanish island of Mallorca embodies this long story, flourishing with groves like those in the Serra de Tramuntana, photographed here. Some trees across the island are older than its medieval cathedrals. Here, olives are gently picked, pressed within hours, and transformed into an oil prized for its fruity, almond, and herbal notes. Each harvest continues a legacy: the fruit nourishes, the wood fuels fires, and the roots stabilize steep slopes. Across millennia, these companions of civilization have witnessed our progress as we witness their endurance—remaining unyielding, persistent, and remarkably green.

> Ever heard coins clinking louder than applause? That's the Trevi Fountain in Rome, Italy, for you—a spot where history, hope, and selfie sticks collide. Completed in 1762, it marks the endpoint of one of ancient Rome's earliest aqueducts, the Aqua Virgo, which still supplies water today. The name 'Trevi' comes from Tre Vie—'three roads'—signifying the junction where it stands. Designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi and finished by Giuseppe Pannini, this 86-foot marvel is the largest Baroque fountain in the city and one of the most famous in the world. Its sculptures show Oceanus, the god of the sea, surrounded by Tritons and horses.
> 
> Visitors come for the view but stay for the ritual: toss a coin over your left shoulder and make a wish. Legend says one coin guarantees a return to Rome, two bring love, and three lead to marriage. Around $3,000 to $4,000 worth of coins are thrown daily—roughly $1.5 million a year—all donated to charity. From the iconic 1960 film 'La Dolce Vita' to LEGO's Trevi Fountain set, and even a replica near Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, this masterpiece still inspires. So, what would you wish for?

<summary>Description</summary>

> Gwalior, in Madhya Pradesh, is not just a city; it is a chapter of India's history. Towering over the skyline, Gwalior Fort is a 6th-century hill fort shaped by generations of rulers and wrapped in legend. Nicknamed 'the Gibraltar of India,' this fort was praised by Mughal emperor Babur as the 'pearl among the fortresses of Hind' for its strength and grandeur. The fort has seen rulers from the Tomars to the Mughals and is linked to battles, royal intrigue, and hidden treasures.
> 
> The fort has six palaces, two of which were built by Raja Man Singh Tomar, who reigned from 1486 to 1516. The architecture reflects a blend of Hindu and Mughal styles. Key landmarks include the Man Mandir Palace, with its turquoise-tiled exterior, and the Sas-Bahu Temples, dedicated to Lord Aniruddha and Lord Shiva. Teli Temple, a rectangular shrine without pillared pavilions, stands out among other such structures. Secret passages and hidden vaults hint at treasures long rumored to be stored inside.
> 
> As the sun sets behind the walls, a sound and light show brings the fort alive, narrating stories of kings, warriors, and dynasties. The majestic Gwalior Fort draws visitors into history that lingers long after they have left.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Look closely at this ammonite fossil. Its swirling shell, once home to a prehistoric sea creature, holds a mathematical secret—a spiral pattern. Each new chamber is proportionally larger than the previous one, maintaining a consistent growth ratio, often associated with the Fibonacci sequence.
> 
> Each November 23, we celebrate Fibonacci Day, named after the 13th-century Italian mathematician Leonardo Bonacci (Fibonacci), who introduced the concept to Europe. The pattern 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8…—where each number is the sum of the two before it—was, however, first described in India as early as 200 BCE by the ancient poet-mathematician Pingala. The Fibonacci sequence appears widely in nature, including pineapples, artichokes, pinecones, and the arrangement of leaves on a stem.
> 
> Ammonites were mollusks that lived between 400 and 66 million years ago, gliding through ancient seas inside coiled shells that protected their soft bodies. When ammonites perished, sediment buried their shells, and minerals slowly turned them to stone, preserving this natural geometry for millions of years. Today, the ammonite fossil is a striking reminder that math and nature speak the same language.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
