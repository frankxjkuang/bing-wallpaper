<summary>Description</summary>

> Since the first pictures arrived from the James Webb Space Telescope this July, the world has been mesmerized by the vividness, resolution, and literally otherworldly nature of the telescope's infrared images. The JWST's technology will revolutionize the fields of astronomy and cosmology, allowing observation of the first stars in the universe and the formation of the first galaxies. The telescope's high infrared resolution and sensitivity may even allow it to reveal potentially habitable exoplanets.
> 
> Today marks the first day of World Space Week, a UN-recognized event that runs each year from October 4, the anniversary of the launch of Sputnik in 1957, to October 10, the anniversary of the Outer Space Treaty going into effect in 1967. We're celebrating with this iridescent image of an early star-forming region called the Cosmic Cliffs in the Carina Nebula, captured in infrared.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In Belgium's largest city, the Antwerp Port Authority is housed in a century-old building that sports a gleaming new addition. The update to the building, known as the Port House, was the vision that Zaha Hadid created with her team at Zaha Hadid Architects, which won a 2009 competition to build the new structure around a 1911 firehouse. Work was completed in 2016, the same year the famed architect died. The expansion is intended to resemble the hull of a sailing ship with a protruding bow glimmering with diamonds, recalling Antwerp's longtime trade in precious stones.
> 
> Today we celebrate World Architecture Day and its 2022 theme of 'Architecture for well-being.' Architecture that preserves historic buildings by combining them with modern structures is becoming more prevalent as cities seek to retain the spirit of their earlier incarnations while creating new, modern spaces and never-before-seen constructions. Some famous examples of this style include the Brooklyn Museum in New York City, the Museum of Military History in Dresden, Germany, and another Hadid design, St. Antony's College in Oxford, England.

<summary>Description</summary>

> October means pumpkin fields, Halloween, leaf-peeping, and the World Series. But in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the beginning of October means a skyful of hot air balloons. The 50th Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta is the largest gathering of balloonists in the world, with more than 500 hot air balloons going aloft this week. The now nine-day event got its start by launching 13 balloons from a shopping mall parking lot in 1972 to celebrate the birthday of a local radio station. It has easily become the biggest event of the year in Albuquerque, whose entire populace can view balloons in flight simply by stepping outside their homes and looking up.
> 
> The event is staged from the 365-acre Balloon Fiesta Park, on the northern outskirts of Albuquerque with the Sandia Mountains a few miles away. The Balloon Fiesta claims to be the most photographed event in the world, and it's easy to understand why. The highlight of the week is a mass ascension, in two waves, of all the balloons, decorated with every color and some shaped like animals or cartoon characters. In the age of jets and helicopters and rockets, this mass celebration of nearly silent flight reminds us that the magic of flying is not about speed, but simply reaching the sky.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> There are thousands of waterfalls in Yosemite National Park, but perhaps none are as well known as Bridalveil Fall. First things first: Don't call it 'falls' because then someone may think you were in Utah where another waterfall bears the surprisingly similar name, Bridal Veil Falls. Bridalveil, as seen in the photo, is often the first waterfall visitors to Yosemite encounter. It plunges 617 feet and flows year-round, fed with water from Ostrander Lake nearly 10 miles away. When the flow is light, brisk winds blow the water sideways. That's why the Ahwahneechee Native Americans, who have lived in the Yosemite Valley for centuries, traditionally called the waterfall Pohono, or 'Spirit of the Puffing Wind.'
> 
> When Yosemite was made a national park on this date in 1890, it not only preserved this jewel of the Sierra Nevada from being turned over to sheep grazing, it was also pivotal to the continued idea of protecting natural areas for the future. Scottish American environmentalist John Muir is credited with convincing President Benjamin Harrison to preserve the Yosemite Valley, and that success kicked off a string of conservation efforts that would eventually lead to the creation of the National Park System. Today, Yosemite's pristine wilderness is internationally known for mountains, granite cliffs, giant sequoia groves, and, of course, waterfalls.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The end of September in the Southern Hemisphere means warming weather and the nearing of summer. For southern right whales like this one off the coast of Argentina, it's time to migrate southward toward Antarctica and rich feeding grounds. Southern right whales are a subspecies of right whale that inhabit the oceans below the equator. They feed on krill at the surface of the water, holding their mouths open as they swim through clouds of the tiny crustaceans.
> 
> Right whales got their name because they were the 'right' whale to hunt, desirable to whalers because they were relatively slow and floated when they died. Right whales are easily identifiable by the thick white calluses on their heads. They tend to be social and curious creatures and sometimes have close encounters with humans. They spend the southern winter in warmer waters closer to the equator. The whale featured today surfaced off the Valdes Peninsula, home to the largest breeding population in the world, and a fitting location for the Southern Whale Natural Monument, created in 1984. In these protected waters, thousands of whales will mate and give birth, staying until October or November, when they will begin their great migration south.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Clothes used to be animal hides and fur. Art used to be stick figures painted on cave walls. Times have changed. Now fashion is a major industry and art can be a lucrative field, too. Today we're celebrating 'wearable art,' which blurs genres and has passionate devotees. Curious? Well, check out the World of WearableArt (WOW), which is WOW-ing (sorry) fashion and art fans with its awards show in New Zealand right now. The competition runs till October 16 and features work by global designers, artists, and costumers—it's New Zealand's largest theatrical production. The competition is just part of the event, though—there are dancers, musicians, and aerialists, too.
> 
> Our photo shows Infini-D, a 2019 winner that is, according to a press release, 'a homage to Yayoi Kusama—a meditation on geometry, dimensionality, and cinematic postmodern gothic,' by Australian designers Tara Morelos, Ahmad Mollahassani, and Nelia Justo. It's not just the look that's unconventional: The outfit was created using electronics, acrylic, cardboard, and fabric. We suspect it's not designed to be worn in the rain.
> 
> WOW is the brainchild of Dame Suzie Moncrieff, a sculptor who envisioned art displayed on the moving human body rather than static, dull gallery walls. She organized the first event in 1987, in the rural New Zealand area of Nelson, where she lived. Now it's held in New Zealand's capital, Wellington, and it's become a worldwide phenomenon, with 103 designers from around the globe delighting audiences this year.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> At one point in history, the United States had upwards of 14,000 wooden covered bridges. Most of them were built between 1825 and 1875 to cross a stream or river and were intended to withstand the elements. An uncovered wooden bridge may have a life span of only about 20 years while a covered bridge could stand for more than 100. Even still, they don't fare well without upkeep and restoration costs can be high. That's why iron replaced wood as the preferred bridge-building material in the mid-1800s. These days, fewer than 900 of the original wooden covered bridges are believed to still be standing. The A. M. Foster Bridge, seen in today's photo, can be found in Cabot, Vermont.
> 
> Named after Alonzo Merrill Foster, the inventor of a type of spout for collecting maple tree sap to be made into syrup, the bridge is located on Spaulding Farm. Don't be deceived—the Foster Bridge is actually a 1990s replica of a 'farm bridge' that was built in 1890 and known as the Orton Bridge. Despite being a replica, the Foster Bridge was authentically constructed by hand, in collaboration with Foster's great-grandson, with spruce lumber and salvaged granite. Spanning 45 feet across a pond and literally bridging the gap between two farms, it took less than six weeks to complete. Unfortunately, the bridge was found to be too narrow for modern farm equipment, a miscalculation that its constructors found amusing. Still, it works well as a photo opportunity and frequent venue for weddings.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
