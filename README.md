> As Christmas Eve arrives, millions embrace customs that connect us to our roots—or introduce us to entirely new cultures. In snowy regions like the Bavarian Alps in Germany—a frost-kissed landscape seen in today's image—festive lights glow against winter's chill. Elsewhere, the sun blazes brightly: think of the Caribbean, Australia, or Brazil, where Christmas often means golden beaches instead of frosty mornings.
> 
> In Germany, you might wander through a festive market with a steaming cup of Glühwein (mulled wine) in hand, weaving from one stall to the next. In Caracas, Venezuela, you'll join crowds rollerblading to Christmas Mass. Head to Mexico, and you'll find quirky radish sculptures from the Night of the Radishes festival, left over from the night before. For those drawn to mystery, Ukraine decorates trees with spider webs, and Wales celebrates Mari Lwyd—a horse's skull adorned and paraded door to door. The list of traditions is endless. What feels ordinary to one may be an entirely new world to someone else. So tonight, open your heart—and maybe your door—someone might be eager to discover your holiday tradition.

> Few creatures evoke the magic of the holidays quite like the reindeer. Also known as caribou, they are the spirit animals of Christmas lovers—and they rock it. Sturdy and sure-footed, they've been pulling Santa's sleigh ever since Clement Clarke Moore cast them in the role in his 1823 poem 'A Visit from Saint Nicholas.' And they were born for it. Their hooves shrink in winter to expose a gripping rim, then expand in warmer months for better traction. Still not impressed? Consider this: reindeer don't have an internal clock. Instead, their melatonin—the hormone that regulates sleep—adjusts to light and darkness, helping them stay awake through endless nights of gift delivery.
> 
> Reindeer carry Santa through the air, excel on land, and move effortlessly through icy waters, thanks to their strong swimming skills. Their robust bodies—males can weigh up to 550 pounds—bear antlers stretching over 55 inches, sometimes crowned with 44 proud points. Today's image comes from Finland, where reindeer outnumber people, roaming a land as timeless as the holiday spirit they embody.

> As Christmas approaches, each sunset gives way to a glow of festive lights, bringing a touch of wonder and preparing us for the holiday season. One of the world's most beloved stage works, 'The Nutcracker,' is rooted in this very sense of magic. The story unfolds on Christmas Eve, in the midst of holiday cheer, when Clara receives a nutcracker as a gift. As night falls and the household drifts into sleep, the little girl and her nutcracker embark on a fantastical journey—battling the Mouse King and wandering through the Land of Sweets. Among its most famous moments is the dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy—the ruler of the Land of Sweets—accompanied by music that has become iconic. Tchaikovsky composed these enchanting melodies for the celesta, an instrument often called the bell-piano.
> 
> Based on the book 'The Nutcracker and the Mouse King' by E.T.A. Hoffmann, the ballet premiered in 1892 in Russia and has since been reimagined countless times—from grand productions by leading ballet companies to musicals and family adaptations. Today's image captures the Turkish State Opera and Ballet's Ankara performance, where snow-dusted silhouettes evoke a fairy-tale world, gently heralding the holiday season.

> Ever felt as if the night just wouldn't end? That's the winter solstice working its magic. It is the shortest day and longest night of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, occurring around December 21 or 22. In the Southern Hemisphere, the same happens around June 21 or 22. It marks the moment when one of Earth's poles tilts farthest from the sun. From that instant, daylight slowly begins to lengthen again.
> 
> This celestial event has fascinated people since the Neolithic era. Sites like Newgrange in Ireland and Stonehenge in England were built to capture the solstice sunrise or sunset. In ancient Egypt, temples such as the Temple of Amun-Ra at Karnak and the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut at Luxor were aligned with it. For the ancient Romans, December 25 marked the solstice, ushering in Saturnalia, a lively festival of revelry, feasts, and gifts. Across cultures, the solstice has become a celebration of light's return. In Iran, Yalda Night honors the triumph of light over darkness, while in Scandinavia, St. Lucia's Day brightens winter with candlelit processions.

> As Christmas draws near, star lanterns begin to appear everywhere—twinkling from balconies, shining in shop windows, and lighting up market stalls. Their shimmer cuts through the long winter nights, filling streets and homes with joy, color, and a sense of togetherness. But behind these festive decorations lies a story as captivating as their glow.
> 
> The first of these stars emerged in Niesky, Germany, in the early 1800s. Students at a Moravian Church boarding school crafted what we now call the Herrnhut Star, or Moravian Star, during a geometry lesson. That 26-pointed marvel, crafted from paper and cardboard, soon came to symbolize the Star of Bethlehem and the spirit of Advent. By 1897, Pieter Verbeek, a former student of that school, began producing and selling them. His son Harry later continued the tradition, founding the Herrnhut Star Factory in 1925.
> 
> From that humble beginning, the tradition spread across Europe and the world. Today's Christmas star lanterns, whether handmade or electric, simple or ornate, echo that same idea. Each one reminds us that even a single spark of light has the power to uplift hearts and brighten the season.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Bormio is a mountain town in northern Italy's Lombardy region, nestled in the Alps near the Stelvio Pass. This location has connected communities across mountain valleys for centuries, shaping how people live and move through the region. Today's image features Bormio's winter landscape, a reflection of its high-altitude setting and enduring bond with the surrounding peaks.
> 
> Its strategic position helped Bormio develop a strong civic identity. For many years, it was one of the 'Three Magnificent Communities,' which held local autonomy and served as an administrative center for nearby settlements. The medieval town layout remains visible in its stone buildings and public spaces, including the Kuerc Square, where community decisions were once made. These structures reflect how governance and daily life adapted to the challenges of a mountain environment.
> 
> Bormio is also known for its natural hot springs that have been documented since Roman times. Historic bathhouses, such as the Bagni Vecchi, show how thermal waters supported health, social life, and resilience during harsh winters. Today, the town is part of Stelvio National Park, where its history, landscape, and culture continue to be preserved.

> Rock layers formed over millions of years and a massive bend in the Earth's crust give this desert a rare window into geologic history. This is Capitol Reef National Park in Utah, where sandstone cliffs and canyons preserve a striking record of the planet's past. December 18 marks the anniversary of its designation as a national park in 1971. Today's featured image highlights the sandstone monoliths of Cathedral Valley, including the Temple of the Sun, part of this extraordinary, protected landscape.
> 
> Capitol Reef takes its name from two defining features: rounded Navajo sandstone domes—within the Waterpocket Fold—that resemble the US Capitol building, and the Fold's ridges that form a 'reef,' which blocked early travel across the desert. Before becoming a national park, the area was designated as a national monument in 1937.
> 
> This anniversary also honors the human history linked to this region. Indigenous communities lived along the Fremont River long before pioneer orchards appeared, leaving petroglyphs carved into canyon walls.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
