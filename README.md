<summary>Description</summary>

> If you're looking for a Halloween destination that combines history with a hefty dose of hauntings, Edinburgh Castle is the place to be. Positioned high on an extinct volcano, the castle's royal connections go back nearly 1,000 years, and its walls have witnessed wars, royal births, executions, and other dramas. But what really sets it apart, is its reputation as one of Scotland's most haunted spots.
> 
> Legend has it that the Grey Lady, Janet Douglas, roams the castle's corridors. Also known as Lady Glamis, a noblewoman accused of witchcraft by King James V, she is believed to still lament her fiery execution in 1537. Others say the Grey Lady might be the ghost of Marie de Guiseâ€”mother of Mary, Queen of Scotsâ€”mourning her lost power amid the turmoil of religious reform. Then there's the Dung Man, a prisoner who attempted to escape in a wheelbarrow full of excrement. He died from the fall when the cart was emptied from the castle wall. The lost piper, who vanished into underground tunnels, continues to play a haunting melody beneath the city. And in 2001, the shadowy figure of a man in a leather apron emerged during a paranormal research project, leaving volunteers with a chilling memory. Spooked yet?

<summary>Description</summary>

> The Halloween season is upon us, so let's meet one of the holiday's icons: the great horned owl. With its keen vision, eerie vocalizations, and silent flight, this owl has historically been revered and feared. In folklore and mythology, owls were considered symbols of wisdom and omens of death. On Samhain, the Celtic precursor to Halloween, the owl was believed to be the kin of roaming spirits.
> 
> The owl in today's image is far more than a character in ghostly tales. Often called the 'tiger of the air,' the great horned owl, named for its signature feathers that look like horns, is one of the most fearsome and adaptable predators in the ornithological world. Primarily active at night, the owl has large, powerful talons that exert around 300 pounds of pressure, which it uses to grab prey like small rodents and skunks. It has incredible night vision, but its eyes are fixed, so it must turn its head a whopping 270 degrees to see everything. So, whether you hear it hooting from treetops or see it flying in the night, this owl proves that not all scary apparitions are supernatural.

> As fall covers the landscape with amber hues and the chill of Halloween approaches, it's time to start carving some spooky jack-o'-lanterns. Originally from Ireland and Scotland, this craft was brought to America by immigrants who initially made lanterns from turnips and potatoes but later found pumpkins more plentiful and easier to carve. Once hollowed out and lit with candles, the gourds were transformed into flickering defenses against evil spirits.
> 
> Today's image shows a pumpkin field in Victoria, British Columbia in Canada, full of blank canvases awaiting their ghoulish and whimsical creations. As people gather to scoop, carve, and light their pumpkins, they take part in a shared ritual passed down through generations. As well as gracing porches to welcome trick-or-treaters, pumpkins fill pies and spice up lattes, adding a tasty element to the season that many anticipate all year long. Once merely a fruit, the pumpkin now enjoys a revered place in Halloween celebrations.

> Polar Bear Week champions the Arctic's majestic predator, one of nature's greatest hunters. Established by Polar Bears International, it highlights the challenges they face due to climate change, particularly the rapid loss of Arctic Sea ice. At this time of year, polar bears gather in Churchill, Canadaâ€”known as the 'polar bear capital of the world.' Here, bears wait for Hudson Bay to freeze so they can start hunting for seals, their primary food source.
> 
> Despite their huge size, these marine mammals are remarkably good swimmers, often covering more than 90 miles at a time. With their thick fur and a generous layer of fat, polar bears perfectly adapt to cold environments. Yet, they now navigate a fragile line between survival and decline. As the ice melts, their hunting grounds disappear. Polar Bear Week aims to make sure these noble giants of the North have a secure future.

<summary>Description</summary>

> On Germany's Baltic coast lies the Gespensterwald, which means 'Ghost Forest,' seen in today's image. This spine-tingling forest covers about 445 acres, with its gnarled beech, hornbeam, ash, and oak trees twisting toward the sky. The salty sea air, wind, and the moist climate helped mold the trees' distorted shapes, which look particularly haunting at night. Visitors to this forest in the Mecklenburg-West Pomerania region, can brave the trails alone or sign up for a storytelling session where actors dressed as ghosts bring local legends and folktales to life. Photographers and nature enthusiasts alike find inspiration in the eerie silhouettes etched against the sky, immortalized in countless pictures.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Picture yourself at the highest peak in the Alps, where the air is crisp and the views are breathtaking. The towering presence of Mont Blanc has left an indelible mark on literature, most notably on Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein.' The last Friday of October is Frankenstein Friday, honoring Shelley's literary genius and the fascinating creature born from her imagination. 'Frankenstein' was conceived during a ghost story challenge. In 1816, an 18-year-old Shelley, along with fellow writers Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Polidori, and Lord Byron, spent a stormy summer in Switzerland. Forced inside by incessant rain, she penned the tale of Victor Frankenstein and the Creature. A pivotal scene in the novel takes place on a glacier near Mont Blanc, where Victor is confronted by his monstrous creation. This setting, with its surreal beauty and treacherous terrain, perfectly captures a sense of awe and terror.
> 
> 'Frankenstein,' also known as 'Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus,' was first published anonymously in 1818. Shelley's use of the epistolary formâ€”a novel told through lettersâ€”and her blend of Gothic and early science fiction made 'Frankenstein' a timeless classic.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> In the ghostly silence of Bodie, California, it feels like time stands still. This mining camp became a booming gold rush town in the 1870s, after a cave-in revealed a rich vein of gold. Bodie was named after W.S. Bodey, a prospector who died in a blizzard before seeing the town's rise. When large deposits were found there, it grew to nearly 10,000 residents, with saloons, dance halls, and breweries lining its streets. But as the gold ran dry, so did the town's fortunes. The mines closed, the population dwindled, and by 1915, the place was abandoned. Bodie's streets are now empty, its wooden buildings frozen in decay.
> 
> Today, Bodie is one of America's best-preserved ghost towns. Wandering through the streets, you can peer into dusty homes and storefronts, and even find small artifacts like shards of china and square nails from the glory days. Legend has it that Bodie's ghosts fiercely guard the town, and those who take souvenirs risk being cursed with bad luck. Taking items home is also strictly against the park's rules. So, be sure to leave with nothing but memoriesâ€”lest the town's spirits follow you home.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
