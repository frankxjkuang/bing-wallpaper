> It would be pretty tough to live on Mars. It's cold, dry, and the conditions are harsh. The planet's average temperature is about –81 degrees Fahrenheit, but it can get as low as –243 at the poles. But with many canyons, extinct volcanoes, and ice caps, it's beautiful to look at from afar. Most photos of the red planet highlight its rusty color, caused by high levels of iron oxide.
> 
> This photo from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is an enhanced-color view of sand dunes and ripples in the Gamboa Crater. 'False color' technology was used to reveal subtle variations of the Martian surface that our eyes wouldn't be able to see on their own. These added details show the effects of wind inside the crater, providing a glimpse of the spectacularly complex features of this planet.

> For St. Patrick's Day, we're enjoying this stunning rainbow over Ireland's southeast coast. Shamrocks, parades, and all things green will be the order of the day as we celebrate the patron saint of the Emerald Isle. While many countries recognize the holiday today, the first celebration was held in Ireland more than 1,000 years ago, remembering the 5th-century missionary and bishop credited with bringing Christianity to the country.
> 
> Our homepage image shows a jewel of Ireland's spectacular southeast coastline, Copper Coast Geopark, a UNESCO site in County Waterford. This magnificent stretch of undulating cliffs and sandy coves is named after the 19th-century copper mines that once operated there. It is dotted with historical sites, including ruined medieval churches, Iron Age forts, and ancient inscribed stones. And, with a little Irish luck, you might just find a pot of gold at the end of that rainbow.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Giant pandas are loved the world over but nowhere more than in China, where they are considered national treasures. On March 16, we celebrate these distinctive bears, which live mainly in forests in the mountains of western China and subsist almost entirely on a diet of bamboo. These black-and-white giants start off small—a newborn panda is about the size of a stick of butter—but after eating their way through between 26 and 84 pounds of bamboo a day, male adults can weigh in at up to 300 pounds.
> 
> China's Chengdu Panda Base, pictured on our homepage, houses one of the world's largest populations of giant pandas bred in captivity. Their journey started with six rescued giant pandas in the 1980s, and the base is now home to about 150 of these beautiful animals. In the wild, panda numbers are rebounding after years of decline thanks to conservation efforts. The species has been upgraded from 'endangered' to 'vulnerable' but they still require our help—and events like Panda Day—to raise awareness of the need to protect these loveable giants.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Huddled beneath these pink-gray stone monoliths is the pretty village of Agüero, in Huesca province, northern Spain. The textured cliffs known as the Mallos de Agüero act as a 660-foot-high backdrop to this picturesque village, drawing both climbers and photographers keen on capturing the perfect shot. This hidden gem in the foothills of the Pyrenees has about 130 residents and is popular with tourists, thanks to the 12th-century Church of Santiago. A national monument with intricate stone carvings of beasts and religious scenes, the church was never finished but is considered one of this region's most beautiful Romanesque temples. If you consider yourself a history buff, a rock climber, or both, put Agüero on your travel list.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we're observing Pi Day with a bird's-eye view of the hedge maze at Cyherbia Botanical Park near Ayia Napa in Cyprus. It's the day we celebrate the mathematical constant π. Today's date, March 14, was chosen because when expressed numerically, it matches the first three digits of pi: 3.14. You remember pi from geometry class—it's the ratio of the distance around a circle to the distance across it. Pi is used to compute a circle's area and circumference. The circular labyrinth at the Cyherbia Botanical Park brings the ratio to life and is a must-visit for people who love to solve puzzles. If you're ready for a challenge, give it a go.

> It's tiring losing that hour of sleep as the clocks 'spring forward,' so let's relax for a while with these champion nappers, in Tanzania's Serengeti National Park. One of the most spectacular wildlife ecosystems on the planet, the park is home to rhinos, leopards, elephants, giraffes—and a huge lion population. The grassland here is dotted with rock formations that stick out like islands, the largest of which, the simba kopjes, are popular hangouts for lions and are said to have inspired Pride Rock in 'The Lion King.' In the heat of the Serengeti, lush trees provide the perfect shelter for lions to take a nap and reenergize. We hope you are as cozy as you curl up and recuperate on National Napping Day.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The Lucian Blaga National Theater, in the Romanian city of Cluj-Napoca, is a cultural icon. Built between 1904 and 1906, it was designed by the famous Austrian architects Ferdinand Fellner and Hermann Helmer in the Neo-Baroque style, popular in the late 19th century. This opulent style nodded back to the grandiosity of the Baroque movement, which began in Rome in the 1600s and flourished across Europe. The building houses both the national theater and the Romanian Opera and plays host to a wide array of cultural events here in Romania's second-largest city.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
