> Odds are this very focused puma has its eyes locked on a guanaco, a relative of the llama that's firmly at the top of its daily menu. In this case, dinner will be served in Torres del Paine National Park in the Patagonia region of Chile, the sprawling park recognized as one of the most famous places in the world to watch and photograph wild pumas. While tourists will sometimes see the big cats on their own, trained guides take visitors on hikes or all-terrain vehicle tours to look for the stealthy pumas. The wild cats have been officially protected for the last few years, bolstering their population, and there are abundant guanacos in the Patagonian steppes, which also helps.
> 
> The puma (which is the same big cat you might call a mountain lion or cougar) is the fourth-largest cat in the world, following the lion, tiger, and jaguar. Pumas don't roar like their large cousins—instead, they purr like house cats. That might explain why people in Patagonia simply call pumas gatos ('cats' in Spanish). With their characteristic slim build and impressive camouflage coloring, these canny hunters can live 10 years in their remote Patagonian home.

<summary>Description</summary>

> We're kicking off Hispanic Heritage Month with this beautiful mural celebrating the contributions made to the Buffalo, New York, region by the Hispanic and Latinx communities. Artist, community activist, and educator Betsy Casañas, with the assistance of many local artists, created this mural called 'Homeland, Perhaps It Is Because I Wish to See You Fly, That My Flight Continues to Be Yours.' Its subjects highlight local cultural heritage, including portrayals of agricultural production and industrial work. Through conversations with members of the community, Casañas incorporated symbolism inspired by the mixed and integrated Latinx community of Buffalo.
> 
> Hispanic Heritage Month, a celebration of Hispanic and Latinx contributions to the United States, takes place each year from September 15 to October 15. Why doesn't it start at the beginning of the month? Because September 15 and 16 are important dates for many Hispanic communities in the Americas. On September 15, 1821, five Central American nations (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua) declared their independence from Spain, almost 11 years to the day (September 16, 1810) after Mexico had declared its independence. These countries were specifically mentioned when US President Lyndon Johnson proclaimed the enactment of what was then Hispanic Heritage Week. In the 1980s, the week became a month, and Belize (which had declared independence from the UK on September 21, 1981) was added to the list of celebrated nations.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In the late 1800s, pioneers in Utah who wanted to expand their settlements south into Arizona were confronted by 600 miles of deep canyons carved by the Colorado River. By 1873 a ferry was established to cross the Colorado at the mouth of Glen Canyon—Lees Ferry, as it was called, remained vital to settlers in the area for more than 50 years, until authorities decided a bridge would provide more reliable and safer crossing. Construction began in 1927 of a span across the 834-foot gap of Marble Canyon, at the head of the Grand Canyon. When Grand Canyon Bridge opened to traffic in 1929 it was hailed as a 'modern marvel' and 'the biggest news in Southwest history.'
> 
> But as time passed, the bridge, which was officially renamed Navajo Bridge in 1934, saw heavier vehicles and more traffic. Debates raged over the traffic’s impact on Native land and endangered plants, and the likelihood of debris falling into the river below. The solution was a new, nearly identical but wider second bridge just downstream from the original bridge. It was dedicated on September 14, 1995, to much fanfare. Both bridges, collectively known as Navajo Bridge, are about 470 feet above the river below. The original span serves as a path for humans and horses while the new bridge carries vehicles.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we celebrate the birthday of Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve, which boasts 750-foot (and higher) sand dunes that cover more than 30 square miles. But the towering hills of sand—the tallest in North America—are just one feature of an eye-popping Colorado landscape that includes conifer forests, alpine lakes, and wetlands. The 150,000-acre park and preserve even encompasses stretches of tundra at the higher elevations, where it edges up against the base of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.
> 
> Initially proclaimed a national monument in 1932 by President Herbert Hoover, the territory was redesignated as Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve on September 13, 2004, and the size of the park was quadrupled. The protected landscape provides ample opportunities for visitors to enjoy a wide range of activities, from sandboarding and sand sledding down the steep dunes to hiking, camping, horseback riding, and fat-tire biking.

> Today we're following our nose to the Pantanal in Brazil to visit this member of the toucan family named for the brownish plumage around its ears. What, you've never heard of a chestnut-eared aracari? That could be because aracaris don't really stand out among toucans at a glance: They have long, colorful bills, and they mate for life, always laying eggs in the same nest year after year. But aracaris are much more social nesters: Up to six aracari adults and all their babies might live in one nest.
> 
> Toucans are found in tropical climates in Central and South America, mainly in rainforests—our chestnut-eared friend tends to live in the southern Amazon Basin. Known frugivores, or fruit eaters, toucans have also been spotted eating the occasional lizard or even rival bird. They tend to be friendly with humans and have been successfully kept as pets—but probably prefer the wild life.

> Patriot Day is held each September 11 to honor the people who were killed in the terrorist attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001. US government buildings throughout the world fly the American flag at half-staff on this day, as do many private homes and establishments. Although schools, government offices, and businesses typically remain open on Patriot Day, communities throughout the country hold remembrances and events to honor the 2,977 people who died.
> 
> Patriot Day is also a time to honor thousands of first responders who worked tirelessly and put themselves in harm's way in the horrific aftermath of the attacks. Tribute is also paid to the many men and women who fought in Afghanistan in the months following the attacks.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Many people in Asia celebrate the fall harvest season with the Mid-Autumn Festival—and since the moon is the, um, star of the show, it's also known as the Moon Festival. The holiday falls on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month each year and coincides with the full moon. Our photo features a moon installation from the festivities in Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia. The city is known for its colorful decorations and lively activities during the festival: Crowds flood the city to watch puppet shows, dragon dances, and parades lit by lanterns.
> 
> Of course, no festival is complete without food. Mooncakes are the most abundant treat at the Mid-Autumn Festival. These small, tasty pastries vary in style and flavor depending on the country where you're celebrating. Here in Kuala Lumpur, you can find traditional Chinese mooncakes but also unique local varieties, like some made with durian (a prickly tropical fruit known for both great flavor and ghastly smell) and cubilose (said to be delicious despite being made from dried bird spit).
> 
> But even if you're not keen to sample every kind of mooncake, you can come together with people of all races and creeds to celebrate Mid-Autumn. After all, the moon lights the way for us all.

> Solar Impulse 2 was the second aircraft built by Swiss aviators André Borschberg and Bertrand Piccard. Borschberg is an engineer by training, Piccard a psychiatrist and balloonist who copiloted the first balloon to fly around the world nonstop. The pair took turns piloting the aircraft, which can carry only one person, on a multi-leg, 16-month flight around the world that started and ended in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.
> 
> This image was taken during the final leg from Egypt to Abu Dhabi as Solar Impulse 2 flew over the Great Pyramids of Giza. The superlight plane was powered by thousands of solar cells mounted atop its fuselage and jumbo-jet sized wings. Batteries stored energy so it could fly at night. The going was slow by the standards of modern jet travel—Solar Impulse 2 flew at an average speed of 50 mph. Clearly, solar-powered flight on a commercial scale is still many years away, but as this photo shows, its Kitty Hawk moment is in the books.
