<summary>Description</summary>

> The clue isn't the tracks in the snow—it's the frosted faces peeking out like they've just discovered winter. Estonia is one of Europe's best places to spot Eurasian otters, thanks to its clean rivers, wide wetlands, and snack-filled coastline. This protected species was named Estonia's Animal of the Year in 2024. While globally considered near threatened, their population here has grown substantially, reaching an estimated 2,000 in recent years, up from a historic low of just 300 before the turn of the millennium.
> 
> From Soomaa National Park's flooded forests to Matsalu National Park's calm shallows, these mammals—with their streamlined bodies, webbed feet, and long tails—weave through the country's waters with ease. Their thick fur traps warm air, allowing them to dive into cold Baltic currents without hesitation. While they look cute, their hunting skills are sharp: they track fish, frogs, and crustaceans with precision.
> 
> Unlike their sea otter cousins, Eurasian otters tend to work solo, but in Estonia's wetlands, neighbors aren't far away. They communicate with whistles, chirps, and occasional snorts. When pups arrive, the banks become playful classrooms where young otters learn to swim, eat, and master the 'oops, did I splash you?' face.

<summary>Description</summary>

> On January 11, 1944, Morocco took a bold step toward freedom. Sixty-six leaders signed the Proclamation of Independence, demanding an end to French and Spanish colonial rule and affirming the country's right to sovereignty. This manifesto, backed by Sultan Mohammed V, was presented not only to colonial authorities but also to representatives of the US, UK, and the former Soviet Union—a signal that Morocco's struggle was part of a global call for self-determination. Though repression followed, the movement endured, and by 1956 Morocco achieved full independence, marking a turning point in North African history.
> 
> Today, that spirit of resilience echoes in Chefchaouen, the 'Blue Pearl' of the Rif Mountains. Founded in the 15th century as a fortress against Portuguese incursions, the city later adopted its signature blue palette—a tradition some trace to Jewish influence and others to Andalusian roots. Wandering through its serene alleys, where indigo walls meet crisp mountain air, feels like stepping into a living canvas—a reminder that Morocco's story is painted in courage, culture, and color.

> Few sights capture the spirit of the Alps like the Matterhorn mirrored in Lake Stellisee's glassy waters. Rising 14,692 feet on the Swiss-Italian border, this legendary peak has long symbolized natural beauty and adventure, drawing climbers, hikers, and dreamers from every corner of the globe.
> 
> From Zermatt—a charming, car-free village in Switzerland—the Matterhorn dominates the horizon, its jagged silhouette etched against the sky like a work of art. At Lake Stellisee, the view turns magical, especially at sunrise when the mountain's reflection glows softly on the mirrorlike surface. It feels as though time stands still, as if nature paused just for you to savor the moment.
> 
> Whether you're trekking alpine trails, photographing the shifting light, or simply breathing in crisp mountain air, this scene offers a quiet reminder of why the Alps have inspired travelers for centuries. The Matterhorn isn't just a mountain; it's a reflection of everything that makes Switzerland unforgettable.

> Step into the realm of giants. Try embracing a BFG (Big Friendly Giant) as you wrap your arms around a thousand years of wisdom in a single tree trunk. Welcome to Muir Woods National Monument—established on this day in 1908—a majestic hall of coastal redwoods just north of San Francisco. These towering redwoods are the tallest trees on Earth—one here stretches about 258 feet, roughly the height of 43 people stacked head to toe. Most are 600–800 years old, and some have stood for over a millennium, yet they're still considered 'young' for a species that can live for 2,000 years.
> 
> How do they endure? Thick, fire-resistant bark and tannins ward off insects and disease, while their roots—though only 10 to 13 feet deep—spread outward up to 100 feet and interlock with neighbors for stability. Fog drifting in from the Pacific provides nearly 40% of their water during dry summers, and fallen trees recycle nutrients as 'nurse logs,' fueling new life. As you enter this forest, bow to the trees that rise beyond life itself. Your footsteps ripple through the river of time, flowing toward the future these giants patiently await.

> When a bird is called a starling, you'd expect it to be a bit of a show-off. True to its name, this little creature knows how to steal the spotlight. From shimmering feathers that glint green and purple in the sun, to its ability to mimic sounds, the starling is the headline act. Originally native to Europe and Asia, the common starling has spread across the globe. In the 19th century, a group of them were introduced to New York's Central Park by an enthusiast of birds mentioned in Shakespeare's plays.
> 
> Brighton's West Pier may be a ruin, but when starlings gather above it, the scene is anything but broken. Each evening in autumn and winter, thousands of these small birds twist and turn in the air. The spectacle is called a murmuration, a term as musical as the sound of wings beating in unison. Scientists suggest the birds swoop and swirl to confuse predators, keep warm and share information about roosting spots. Whatever the reason, the result is a dance that has visitors gazing upward, phones in hand, hoping to catch a glimpse before the flock settles for the night.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today is a day that puts time into perspective. Old Rock Day highlights the vast geological processes that have shaped our world since its earliest eras. In Arches National Park, Utah, Turret Arch—seen through North Window—offers a striking reminder: landscapes can take hundreds of millions of years to assemble. The Entrada Sandstone that forms these arches began as shifting dunes and shallow seas long before erosion carved today's shapes. Even so, these formations are relatively young. Most rocks on Earth disappear over time because plate tectonics, erosion, and volcanism continually recycle the crust. Only the planet's ancient continental shields preserve truly old material. Canada's Acasta Gneiss, about 4 billion years old, is the oldest known rock still rooted where it formed.
> 
> Old Rock Day also remembers the pioneers of geology. Theophrastus and Pliny the Elder recorded early mineral studies, while Ulisse Aldrovandi helped establish the term 'geology' in 1603. One hundred fifty years later, William Smith drew the first geological map. And in 1785, James Hutton revealed the Earth's immense age, providing insights that continue to shape our understanding of the ground beneath our feet.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Picture a city where your daily commute offers views of fjords, drifting ice, and the Northern Lights. That's everyday life in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland—a small yet spirited Arctic hub blending Inuit heritage with Nordic modernity. Founded in 1728 by Danish-Norwegian missionary Hans Egede, it began as a small settlement called Godthaab—'Good Hope.'
> 
> Nuuk preserves 18th-century landmarks like the Hans Egede House and the red wooden Nuuk Cathedral. The Greenland National Museum displays Inuit artifacts and the well-preserved Qilakitsoq mummies, offering a glimpse into the island's deep past. This city is also home to the world's only Arctic golf course. But it's not just the sights that define Nuuk—it's how people come together when the cold sets in.
> 
> Winter brings short days and snowfall, yet the city buzzes with life. People head out for cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, boating, or dog sledding along the fjords. Indoors, friends gather for 'kaffemik'—a cozy coffee-and-cake tradition with strong Greenlandic coffee topped with whipped cream. Nuuk shows that life in the cold isn't about endurance—it's about balance, community, and finding color even in the depths of winter.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
