<summary>Description</summary>

> Is there a simpler joy than flying a kite on a windy day? The date of this magical invention is unknown, but the first written documentation of kite flying comes from China in 200 BCE. There they were initially used to measure distance, but over the years they have been tapped for fishing, sport, science, celebration, communication, and recreation. Kites can take many shapes and be made of various materials, but all of them have a wing surface, a tether, and a bridle that keeps the surface at an angle to the wind. In fact, you can easily make your own, and there's no better time than today: Go Fly a Kite Day.

<summary>Description</summary>

> 'Life imitates art far more than art imitates life.' There is perhaps no better day to ponder these iconic words by Oscar Wilde than World Art Day. Celebrated each April 15, it marks the birthday of Renaissance luminary Leonardo da Vinci. The celebration, which started in 2012, continues to be a beautiful reminder of the power of art and its ability to heal, strengthen, and inspire society. The sculpture in today's image, Italian artist Lorenzo Quinn's 'Together,' displayed near the Great Pyramids of Giza, serves as a fitting commentary on this inimitable power of art and also a symbol of the unbreakable human connection.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Sea stars—often called starfish—are some of the most fascinating creatures to live in our oceans. For starters, despite their name, they aren't fish—they belong to a group of marine invertebrates called echinoderms. Like all echinoderms, sea stars are characterized by the radial symmetry of their bodies, which usually have multiple arms extending from the central disc.
> 
> Did you know that sea stars can regenerate their arms? This means if they are attacked by a predator, they can get back into shape eventually (and quite literally). In fact, some species can also regenerate an entirely new sea star from just the arm, provided it still has a bit of the central disc attached to it.

> Phlox subulata is known by many names. While some call it moss pink, others call it creeping phlox, flowering moss, or mountain phlox. No matter what name you know it by, you cannot deny the beauty and charm of these tiny perennial flowers. They bloom in spring and add bright splashes of color wherever they grow.
> 
> This plant's small flowers and carpet-like growth pattern give the appearance of moss; hence, the name. Japan's Hitsujiyama Park in Chichibu is known for shibazakura, as it's known in Japanese. When these flowers are in full bloom, they cover the rolling hills in the park and offer a breathtaking horticultural view.

<summary>Description</summary>

> On April 12, 1961, Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin astounded the world by becoming the first person to travel to outer space. In less than two hours, Gagarin completed a full orbit of the Earth in the Vostok 3KA spacecraft. Less than a month later, Mercury astronaut Alan Shepard became the first American in space. The spectacle of looking back at Earth from space has not lost its charm, as you can see in today's picture taken from the International Space Station. Also known as the 'World Space Party,' Yuri's Night is a global celebration of astronomy and a reflection on how space exploration can unite people in a divided world.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Mossy Grotto Falls is a tiny 20-foot waterfall in Oregon's Columbia River Gorge, home to around 90 waterfalls. This winsome waterfall became popular in recent years after several renowned photographers snapped it following its discovery in 2006. Waterfalls around the world draw our attention and inspire emotions (and even themes for pop songs). In contrast to the serene, burbling Mossy Grotto Falls, Angel Falls in Venezuela is the tallest in the world, where water plunges 2,648 feet before reaching the ground. This roaring wonder is awe-inspiring and one of the top tourist-draws in the country. If you need a moment of reflection, we recommend searching for the nearest waterfall and taking a trip to connect with nature.

<summary>Description</summary>

> We're in Kenya's Amboseli National Park today to celebrate Siblings Day with these baby African elephant twins and their mom. Siblings Day is celebrated every April 10 in parts of the US and other areas of the world. In 1995, Claudia Evart, who lost her siblings at a young age, created this holiday and established the Siblings Day Foundation, which is working to get the holiday officially recognized in the US alongside Mother's Day and Father's Day. India's Raksha Bandhan is the oldest sibling holiday that is still widely observed today, usually falling in August. Hindu women commemorate this day by wrapping a band around their brothers' wrists as a sign of mutual care and respect. If this seems like too much, maybe just pick up the phone and give a loved one a call.
