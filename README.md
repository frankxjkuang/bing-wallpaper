<summary>Description</summary>

> Some months arrive quietly, but February knocks on the door, flips on the spotlight, and says, 'Let's give credit where it's long overdue.' That's the spirit of Black History Month—a time to celebrate African American achievements, confront hard truths, and honor those who shaped the country. It began in 1926 when historian Carter G. Woodson launched Negro History Week. The week grew, spread through schools and communities, and by 1976 it officially expanded into a month.
> 
> February isn't only about icons like Martin Luther King Jr. or Rosa Parks—it also highlights stories that rarely made headlines. One example comes from World War II: in 1944, a US Army Signal Corps photograph captured Black military nurses arriving at the port of Greenock, Scotland. Their overseas service was historic, especially for nurses who had fought to serve beyond segregated bases at home.
> 
> Today, this month feels like a mix of classrooms, concerts, and community meetups. Museums curate exhibits, and schools highlight inventors, thinkers, and trailblazers who never made it into older textbooks. Modern voices also take center stage—scientists pushing boundaries, athletes rewriting records, artists reshaping culture, and entrepreneurs building what comes next.

> Some animals whisper their way through the wild. Zebras don't. They show up in high-contrast stripes, act like it's the most practical outfit ever invented—and somehow, it is. International Zebra Day, celebrated on January 31, gives these black-and-white originals their moment to step out of the herd and into the spotlight.
> 
> These African equines come in three species. Plains zebras—featured in today's image from Namibia's Etosha National Park—wear bold stripes, mountain ones sport pinstripes, and Grévy's go for the ultra-fine, designer look. No two patterns match, turning every individual into a walking fingerprint. Scientists believe those stripes help confuse predators, deter biting flies, and even cool the body by creating tiny air currents.
> 
> Watch a herd—technically called a dazzle—and you'll see how social they are. They groom one another, babysit foals, and communicate through brays and barks. Foals recognize their mothers by memorizing patterns within hours of birth. These mammals are built for speed—up to 40 mph—and teamwork, forming tight circles when threatened. However, shrinking habitats, poaching, and competition with livestock continue to threaten them, making this day essential for raising awareness.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Picture a small island rising from the Cornish sea, connected to the mainland only when the tide retreats. For a few hours a day, you can wander across a centuries-old granite causeway made smooth by pilgrims and fishermen. This is St. Michael's Mount, just off the coast of Marazion, in Cornwall, England. Managed by the National Trust and home to the St. Aubyn family since the 1600s, the mount blends myth, medieval history, and sweeping coastal views.
> 
> The island is filled with stories: from the Archangel Michael guiding sailors to safety in 495 CE to tales of Jack the Giant Killer defeating the fearsome Cormoran. At the summit stands a castle that began as a 12th-century priory, later transformed into a Gothic-inspired fortress with regal drawing rooms, hidden staircases, and panoramic terraces.
> 
> Below, the harbor's cobbled lanes wind through a historic fishing village once busy with boats and trade. Whether you are exploring the gardens clinging to the granite cliffs or wandering the battlements imagining battles of the Civil War and the Spanish Armada, St. Michael's Mount is a rare place where past and legend feel equally alive.

<summary>Description</summary>

> If you've ever wandered through downtown Milwaukee and looked up in awe, chances are you were staring at the iconic Milwaukee City Hall. Completed in 1895, this towering Flemish Renaissance Revival masterpiece doesn't just dominate the skyline; it defines it. For nearly eight decades, it stood as the city's tallest building, a title it proudly held until 1973. Designed by architect Henry C. Koch, this hall blends German-inspired architecture with Milwaukee's own historic influences. That connection isn't accidental—its design pays tribute to the city's strong German heritage, which shaped much of the surrounding neighborhood as well.
> 
> One of the building's most fascinating features lies beneath your feet: its foundation rests on more than 2,500 white pine piles driven deep into the marshy banks of the Milwaukee River. Inside, visitors are greeted by a soaring eight-story atrium crowned with a glass skylight, seen in today's image.
> 
> Recognized for its significance, Milwaukee City Hall earned a spot on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and was named a National Historic Landmark in 2005. Today, it's still the beating heart of Milwaukee's civic life and a must-see for anyone curious about the city's story.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Whanganui National Park showcases one of New Zealand's most distinctive river landscapes. Established in 1986, the park covers about 286 square miles across the central North Island, with the Whanganui River tracing long, quiet bends through dense forest. Although the river is not officially within the park's boundaries, it shapes nearly everything around it, including the Whanganui Journey—one of New Zealand's designated Great Walks.
> 
> Much of the terrain is wrapped in lowland podocarp–hardwood forest anchored by native trees like kahikatea, rimu, and tawa. Wildlife is common along the river valley, where visitors may see the North Island brown kiwi, the endangered blue duck, and other native birds that depend on stable forest cover. The region's broad ridges, steep drop-offs, and uninterrupted greenery make the park feel larger and more remote than its boundaries suggest.
> 
> History appears in small but striking features, including the Bridge to Nowhere—a concrete bridge built for a former settlement that was later abandoned and reclaimed by forest. Access points and river routes reveal how the area blends natural scenery with traces of earlier communities.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Winter at Lake Kerkini in Greece delivers some of Europe's clearest views of Dalmatian pelicans. Their large silhouettes move in tight, steady groups across the still water, making their scale hard to miss. With wingspans stretching over 10 feet, they rank among the world's largest flying birds. Lake Kerkini's predictable winter conditions offer reliable, close-range views of their size, grace, and coordinated movement.
> 
> As the season advances, the pelicans begin shifting into breeding appearance. Their throat pouches turn a bright orange-red, standing out sharply against pale winter plumage. Regular gatherings at Lake Kerkini allow these changes to be observed week by week, revealing feeding habits, social interactions, and the physical changes that signal the start of the breeding season. The open landscape keeps attention fixed on the birds and their daily routines without distraction.
> 
> Despite their strong winter presence, Dalmatian pelicans remain classified as near threatened. Habitat loss, disturbance, and collisions with power lines continue to slow recovery. Protected wetlands like Lake Kerkini are essential for maintaining stable breeding groups and supporting long-term conservation.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
