> Horns up, heads high! Featured here is a group of gemsboks, a large antelope, reigning over the sprawling savannas in southwestern Africa. Indigenous to the arid territories of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and parts of Zimbabwe, they thrive mainly within the Kalahari and Namib Deserts. They can survive in extremely dry conditions and can go without water for weeks, getting moisture from the food they eat. Moreover, gemsboks are adept runners, achieving speeds of up to 37 miles per hour. Their distinguishing trait is their notably elongated, straight horns. Although both genders possess these formidable defenses, the females' horns tend to be slightly longer and sleeker while the males' horns are thicker with broader bases. So, if you ever find yourself in the sandy plains of the Kalahari, keep an eye out for these desert gems.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In the heart of Japan, where the past and future intertwine, lies a city pulsating with life and culture—Osaka. Traditionally an economic hub, Osaka has twice served briefly as the imperial capital, once in the 7th and once in the 8th century. It flourished culturally during the Edo period (1603–1867) and became a major industrial center after the Meiji Restoration in1868, which restored imperial rule to Japan.
> 
> Known as the 'Nation's Kitchen,' Osaka boasts a culinary scene that tantalizes taste buds with dishes like takoyaki, a ball-shaped fried cake stuffed with chopped octopus, and okonomiyaki, a savory pancake loaded with cabbage, meat, and various toppings. But the city's charm isn't just in its gastronomic delights. Step into the past's embrace at Osaka Castle, a majestic relic of Japan's rich history and a symbol of unwavering resilience. Wander through the gardens of Shitenno-ji Temple, one of the oldest Buddhist temples in the country and an oasis of tranquility amidst the bustling city. Explore Dōtonbori, a district known for its dazzling neon billboards, including the famous Glico Running Man and the towering mechanized crab sign of Kani Dōraku restaurant. Every corner of Osaka is a journey through time and flavors.

> The lush greenery of June is here, and so is National Rivers Month, a 30-day tribute to the veins of our planet that was created by Canadian activist Mark Angelo. Just like the confluence featured here today, where Alaska's Easter Creek and Killik River unite in a beautiful display, we too come together every year to help preserve the nation's rivers. With increasing threats such as pollution, habitat destruction, and overuse, it's more important than ever to advocate for the protection of our waterways. Whether you're paddling down a gentle stream, casting a line for some fishing fun, or simply enjoying a leisurely stroll along the riverbank, there are countless ways to connect with these flowing wonders. The US alone boasts a vast network of over 250,000 rivers that stretches more than 3 million miles across diverse terrains. Which one are you heading to?

> Today, let's embark on a watery adventure as we celebrate World Oceans Day. This day is about honoring and protecting the world's oceans and serves as a reminder of the critical role oceans play in supporting life on Earth. These gargantuan water bodies, after all, teem with wonders, from the tiniest plankton to the grandest whales like the humpbacks we see here. The oceans also produce almost half of the oxygen on our planet thanks to the photosynthesis of plankton—tiny plants, algae, and bacteria. Moreover, they absorb a significant amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping mitigate the impacts of climate change caused by human activities.
> 
> Oceans face many threats, including rising sea temperatures thanks to global warming, plastic pollution, and ocean acidification, which threatens many marine species. The theme for this year's World Oceans Day is 'Awaken New Depths.' This motto encourages us to delve deeper into the ocean's complexities and take urgent actions to ensure that these fascinating, ocean-dwelling animals continue to grace our planet for generations to come. So, are you ready to take the plunge?

<summary>Description</summary>

> Eighty years ago, on the beaches of Normandy, northern France, an event unfolded that would alter the course of history. The day was June 6, 1944, a date forever etched in time as D-Day. It marked the launch of Operation Overlord, the ambitious Allied invasion that became a turning point in World War II. The audacious assault by sea, air, and land involved nearly 160,000 troops.
> 
> Today, on this 80th anniversary, we are featuring Les Braves, a sculpture that pays tribute to the courageous troops who landed here. One such symbol is Les Braves, a sculpture gracing Omaha Beach. French artist Anilore Banon's design features three sections called 'Wings of Hope,' 'Rise, Freedom!,' and 'Wings of Fraternity.' In addition, across the ocean in Michigan, its twin, 'Les Braves II: At Water's Edge,' resonates with the same spirit at The War Memorial. These sister sculptures stand as guardians of memory, inviting a moment of silence from a world that benefited from the bravest of the brave.

> Happy World Environment Day! First celebrated back in 1973, this UN event is now celebrated in more than 143 countries. This year's theme focuses on land restoration, desertification, and drought resilience.
> 
> Pictured here is Madagascar's Masoala National Park, part of the Rainforests of the Atsinanana UNESCO World Heritage Site. This park, which covers nearly 930 square miles, is a wildlife haven harboring hundreds of species including mammals like red ruffed lemurs and aye-ayes, birds like red owls and helmet vanga, reptiles like Madagascar day geckos and tomato frogs, and butterflies, coral species, fish, and sea turtles. The park has been at the forefront of conservation efforts to combat illegal logging, particularly of its rare rosewood trees. So, let's take inspiration from Masoala and champion the planet that cradles us all. After all, there is no planet B.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
