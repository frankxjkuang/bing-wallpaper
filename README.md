<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> For the first day of Women's History Month, we've come to the Capitol Rotunda in Washington, DC, to view the Portrait Monument, which depicts three founding mothers of the 19th-century women's rights movement. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and Susan B. Anthony are particularly known for their efforts to gain American women the right to vote.
> 
> Artist Adelaide Johnson sculpted the Portrait Monument in 1920, the same year that US women finally got the vote, and it was unveiled on Feb 15, 1921 in the Rotunda. The next day, it was moved into storage in the Capitol Crypt. Although the move was supposed to be temporary while a permanent home was selected, it would take 76 years and an act of congress before the Portrait Monument was returned to the Rotunda.

> With its red clay roofs and pastel buildings Atrani shines above a sparkling sea on the Amalfi Coast in southwest Italy. Just 800 people get to call Atrani home, the rest of us can only hope to visit one of the country's smallest towns, walking its narrow roads as we admire the small houses perched above the beach. The traditional fishing village is part of the Costiera Amalfitana UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it has kept its traditional characteristics alive. It is a perfect Mediterranean getaway to soak up the sun and enjoy local seafood at a waterfront cafe.

<summary>Description</summary>

> February 27 marks International Polar Bear Day—an effort to raise awareness of the enormous threats polar bears face due to climate change. Polar bears need Arctic pack ice to hunt on, but that ice is shrinking as the planet warms. While polar bears are excellent swimmers—so much so that they're classified as marine mammals—the Arctic ice is still a crucial part of their survival. Let's take this day to think about what we can do to help reduce climate change and protect polar bear habitats.

> Those brave enough to step out over this suspension bridge will be treated to a macaw's-eye view of the Amazon rainforest, on which the survival of life on Earth depends. The vast Amazon biome, which spans 2.6 million square miles—an area twice the size of India—stores enormous amounts of carbon and supports approximately 10% of all known animal and plant species on Earth.
> 
> The Amazon River discharges more water than any other river on Earth, and almost 20% of all water that flows into the ocean first travels through the Amazon River basin. While almost two-thirds of the Amazon River basin lies in Brazil, it stretches across seven other countries, from the Andes Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean. This section of canopy is in Peru's Tambopata National Reserve, home to giant harpy eagles, macaws, jaguars, capybaras, sloths, and giant otters.

<summary>Description</summary>

> As the sun rises on Bryce Canyon, its snow-capped red rock formations start to glow. These slender towers are called hoodoos, and Bryce Canyon National Park has the highest concentration of them anywhere on Earth.
> 
> The hoodoos here have a soft base of sedimentary rock with a cap of more solid stone. The snow and frost of the Utah winter will eventually wear away the base, causing the cap to fall and leaving the remaining rock exposed to further erosion. Thankfully, these formations are still standing for now, allowing us to take in their natural majesty as the park celebrates its 100th anniversary.

> The cold, dreary backdrop of winter can be the perfect time to show off a little color. This male mandarin duck is doing just that with his handsome crest and vibrant plumage. Come molting season, he will look more like his brown-and-white female counterpart, except for his brightly colored beak.
> 
> Closely related to the North American wood duck, the mandarin duck is native to East Asia, but populations have been introduced to a variety of European countries as well as the British Isles. This drake is hunkering down in Richmond Park, London, a national nature reserve about three times the size of New York's Central Park, so hopefully he won't have too much trouble finding a mate come spring.
