> As spring gives way to summer in Iceland, the rugged landscape bursts into color. Lupines were introduced here in the 1940s for their soil-binding properties, to reduce erosion. The plant flourishes in sandy and salty soils and spreads rapidly, bringing hues of purple, pink, and blue. Although some consider lupine to be a threat to native plants, it is welcomed by many as a cherished part of the summer landscape. You can find lupine fields in Reykjavík, near the Skógafoss waterfall, and lining the road to the Hellissandur Church in the Snæfellsnes Peninsula, as seen in today's image.

> It's Pollinator Week, celebrating the small heroes who help plants flourish. While some plants are self-pollinating, or pollinated by wind or water, most are fertilized with the help of bees, wasps, butterflies, moths, birds—like the green-crowned brilliant hummingbird in today's image—and bats. The non-profit organization Pollinator Partnership is behind the event, which aims to raise awareness about how we can help protect them from threats including habitat loss, pollution, pesticides, and climate change. Should we care? Absolutely! From fruits and veggies to nuts, chocolate, or sugarcane, there are plenty of ingredients in our diet that are brought to us by pollinators, which are a crucial part of our agriculture and ecosystems.

> Today's all about the dads. Father's Day is the perfect time to celebrate everything they do for us, how they look after us, help us grow up, and tell the best dad jokes. There are also great dads in the animal kingdom, like the foxy father seen in today's image. Female red foxes need to stay in their dens with their young after giving birth, so males spend their time going out to bring her food. When the pups are a little older, their father takes time to play with them, teaching them survival skills they'll need in later life, like hunting and scavenging. The foxes seen here don't look red because they are melanistic, a genetic mutation causing an excess of dark pigmentation. This type of red fox is commonly called a silver fox. He might not get a card for his troubles but we're sure he is much appreciated. On Father's Day, why not call your dad, take him out for a meal, and show him how much he means to you.

> Let's hit the waves for International Surfing Day! This event both celebrates the sport and promotes protecting the ocean for wildlife and surfers alike. Surfing has a long history; around 5,000 years ago in Peru, people used reed watercraft to surf the waves when they were out fishing. Polynesians are believed to have brought their version of surfing to Hawaii, where modern surfing was born. Here, people started to stand on their boards and to surf for fun. Historians believe that surfing made its way to the US in 1885, when three teenage Hawaiian princes surfed on redwood boards while on a break from boarding school in California.
> 
> Today's image shows an intrepid surfer riding a wave at Nazaré, Portugal. This town on the Atlantic coast is known for its giant waves, which can reach over 100 feet in height. Thanks to these impressive breakers, several surf records have been broken here, including the biggest wave ever surfed—an incredible 86 feet. So, wax down your surfboards and go out and catch some waves!

> Wave our national symbol today; it's Flag Day! On June 14, 1777, by resolution of the Second Continental Congress, the nation's first official flag was approved. Throughout US history, the flag's design has changed. In its current arrangement, the 13 stripes represent the original colonies, and the stars stand for the states. The flag was last modified in 1960, when Hawaii became a state, and the number of stars increased from 49 to 50.
> 
> Some states have always celebrated the adoption of the Stars and Stripes with parades or by displaying the national flag in their homes; however, the official observance of Flag Day dates back to 1949, thanks to legislation passed by President Harry Truman. We're flying flags on our homepage to mark the 75th anniversary of the national commemoration.

> Welcome to the blue hues of the Registan, a public square at the heart of the city of Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Meaning 'sandy place' in Persian, Registan was a center of activity during the Timurid Renaissance, a period of cultural and intellectual revival in the Muslim world between the 14th and early 16th centuries.
> 
> In this grand square, citizens came together to hear royal proclamations, announced with resounding blasts from colossal copper pipes known as dzharchis. The square is encircled by three Islamic schools, namely the Ulugh Beg Madrasah, the Sher-Dor Madrasah, and the Tilya-Kori Madrasah, characterized by the Islamic architectural style, which typically features elaborate repetitive patterns and ornamental forms. Registan's architectural influence is seen far and wide, from the Safavid monuments of Persia and the Mughal buildings of India and Pakistan to the early 20th-century Saint Petersburg Mosque in Russia.

> Ready to channel your inner nature enthusiast? Let's explore Big Bend National Park in West Texas, which is celebrating its 80th birthday today. The park is the largest protected area in the Chihuahuan Desert, covering over 1,250 square miles. It was established on June 12, 1944, when the state of Texas transferred this land to the federal government.
> 
> Within the park lie landmarks like the Castolon Historic District, where US and Mexican cultures met in one rural border community, and the Hot Springs Historic District, developed in the early 1900s, but with evidence of human occupation dating back thousands of years. Here you can walk in the footprints of modern pioneers, ranchers, and miners. This land is also one of North America's premier destinations for stargazing. With little light pollution from the surrounding areas, it has some of the darkest night skies in the area. Bring your binoculars and enjoy an evening full of Milky Way vistas, meteor showers, and taking pictures of the stunning night sky.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
