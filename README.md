> If you think bees are just out for a sting, think again. These tiny winged workers are running the world's sweetest gig—and they've got a whole day dedicated to their buzz-ness. Welcome to World Honey Bee Day, celebrated every third Saturday in August. About 35% of global food crop production relies on animal pollination, including honey bees. The value of crops pollinated by bees is estimated at hundreds of billions of dollars. Despite their superpowers, bees are in a sticky situation. Habitat loss, pesticides, disease, and climate change are making life in the hive less than ideal.
> 
> Today's image features a row of bright boxes in Italy—those are beehives. Bees use color to distinguish between hives, much like humans use house numbers. Blue, yellow, green, and red hives help reduce confusion and accidental hive invasions. On World Honey Bee Day, let's think outside the hive. Whether it's through colorful conservation, mindful eating, or planting for pollinators, there's always a way to 'bee' involved.

> It's a bird, it's a plane, it's … a fish! Gliding through the ocean with flapping fins and polka-dot flair, the spotted eagle ray refuses to blend in. It doesn't crawl along the seabed like its stingray cousins—it flies underwater. The species gets its name from—you guessed it—its protruding snout, which resembles an eagle's beak, and its distinctive spotted back, which is unique to each individual, much like fingerprints. Their wing-like pectoral fins can span up to 10 feet. Near the base of the long tail are venomous spines, in case a predator gets too close. These rays aren't aggressive, but they're not defenseless either.
> 
> These creatures are often seen alone, but when they travel in groups, it's a show worth watching. Dozens can glide together in perfect sync, like the ones photographed near San Cristóbal Island in Ecuador. They are also known to leap out of the water, sometimes completely clearing the surface, proving you don't need feathers to fly. Despite their elegance, spotted eagle rays are currently listed as near threatened. Their populations are declining due to various threats, including bycatch and habitat degradation.

> There's a mountain in Switzerland that's always looking down on you—but don't take it personally. At 10,026 feet, Piz Nair of the Albula Alps keeps an eye over the Engadine valley in Graubünden. Start in St. Moritz: hop on the funicular (a type of cable railway system) to Corviglia, then ride the cable car to the summit. At the top? A viewing platform and that famous ibex (an alpine goat) statue. There's also a restaurant where you can eat inside a glass cube with 360° views.
> 
> This alpine peak hosted the 1948 Winter Olympics and still boasts some of the most famous ski runs in the country. The 'Piz Nair Wall' is known for its challenging downhill skiing and events like the 2003 World Championship downhill race. Come summer, the snow clears but the trails stay hot. Hikers and mountain bikers flock here to explore alpine meadows, and soak in a different kind of silence. Guided tours and well-marked paths make it easy to find your footing. So, whether you're chasing snow, sun, or just a break from sea-level boredom, this Swiss giant will lift your spirits—literally.

> Just outside Arches National Park in Utah lies a natural wonder that rises like a colossal doorway against the sky, drawing photographers, nature lovers, and hikers. Welcome to Corona Arch, seen in today's image, a towering Navajo sandstone formation that offers big adventure without the big crowds. The Corona Arch Trail starts off easy but packs a punch of scenery: railroad tracks, slickrock scrambles, and even a metal cable assist make it more than just a walk in the desert. After 1.5 miles of walking, the payoff is big: a massive arch that's 140 feet wide and 105 feet high. It's so large that people once swung from it on ropes, until that was banned for safety reasons. Even without the adrenaline stunts, the hike offers beautiful views and unforgettable moments in the heart of Red Rock Country. Also known as Little Rainbow Bridge, it shares visual similarities with the iconic Rainbow Bridge arch near Lake Powell—but Corona Arch holds its own in a more peaceful setting.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Big ears, bigger hearts—elephants are more than just icons of the wild. Every year on August 12, we celebrate World Elephant Day—a global movement to raise awareness about the majestic giants that roam places like Amboseli National Park in Kenya, pictured here. What makes elephants so extraordinary isn't just their size; it's their minds. These animals have incredible memories. Matriarchs, the oldest females, can recall the locations of water sources from decades past, and they use that knowledge to lead their herds through tough times. Their social bonds run just as deep. Elephants live in close-knit families, mourn their dead, and have even been observed comforting one another during hard times.
> 
> But even in protected spaces like Amboseli, elephants face threats. Habitat loss, climate change, and the illegal ivory trade continue to take a toll. World Elephant Day is more than a celebration; it's a reminder that without our help, even these mighty animals could quietly disappear. So, as you admire this African elephant herd in the image today, remember: each elephant carries a lifetime of memories and a future worth fighting for.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Tucked into the northern Italian Alps, the village of Santa Maddalena is a postcard-perfect hamlet in South Tyrol's valley of Val di Funes. With its iconic church steeple set against the jagged peaks of the Dolomites—a mountain range in the Alps—it's one of the most photographed spots in the region. The Dolomites themselves—a UNESCO World Heritage Site—rise dramatically behind the village, their pale limestone faces glowing pink at sunset in a phenomenon locals call 'enrosadira.'
> 
> Santa Maddalena is small, quiet, and deeply rooted in local Ladin and Tyrolean traditions. Wooden chalets dot the green hills, and cows graze in meadows that seem painted into place. Although it feels remote, the village is a gateway to some of the Dolomites' best hiking, including trails through Puez-Odle Nature Park. In winter, it's a peaceful base for snowshoeing and cross-country skiing. Visitors come not for crowds or nightlife, but for silence, scenery, and a sense of timelessness. Santa Maddalena is where nature and culture meet in harmony—no filter needed.

<summary>Description</summary>

> With a roar that echoes across the plains, lions have long captured the human imagination. On August 10, World Lion Day invites us to celebrate these iconic big cats while raising awareness about their declining numbers and the urgent need for conservation.
> 
> One of the best places to witness lions in the wild is Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya. Nestled in the heart of East Africa, this vast savanna is home to around 850 to 900 lions. The reserve's rich ecosystem and seasonal wildebeest migration offer a front-row seat to the drama of lion life—from territorial battles to cooperative hunts. But Maasai Mara is more than a wildlife haven; it's a model for community-led conservation. Local Maasai communities work alongside conservationists to protect both lions and their ancestral lands, showing that coexistence is not only possible but powerful. On World Lion Day, let's honor these majestic animals by supporting efforts that ensure their survival—for the health of ecosystems and the heritage of future generations.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
