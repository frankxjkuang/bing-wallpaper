> Today, on Endangered Species Day, we unite in a collective effort for conservation. Currently, there are over 44,000 species that are threatened with extinction. Among the world's most endangered animals are Javan and black rhinos, mountain gorillas, and Hawksbill turtles.
> 
> Today, let us take you to the Tarangire National Park in Tanzania, where African elephants roam freely. These gentle giants are characterized by their large, flapping ears, long trunks, and curved tusks. They live in small family groups led by a matriarch and while they are known to noisily trumpet, they also communicate over distances through low-frequency sound waves. Unfortunately, threats like habitat loss and poaching have left them on the brink of extinction. Endangered Species Day highlights efforts to protect all endangered animal and plant species worldwide, big and small.

> Happy International Day of Light! Held on May 16, it marks the anniversary of the invention of the laser by the American physicist and engineer Theodore Maiman in 1960. This pioneering creation helped revolutionize fields from communications to health care and lasers are now found in everything from printers and barcode scanners to surgical devices. Today's event also celebrates light's presence in every aspect of human existence, from art and culture to science and technology.

> Today's image features 'Feelings Are Facts,' a collaborative installation by Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson and Beijing-based architect Ma Yansong. In 2010 it filled the Great Hall of the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing with illuminated fog. A grid of lights partitioned the haze into the primary colors of red, green, and blue, blending seamlessly at intersections to create transitional hues of cyan, magenta, and yellow. Gallery visitors relied solely on intersecting hues of colored fields to navigate the fog.

> With deep rocky canyons and high ancient sea ledges, Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico boasts some of the most unique rock formations in the world. Hidden beneath its desert scenery are more than 119 caves—formed when sulfuric acid dissolved the surrounding limestone. This national park, founded on this day in 1930, is also home to North America's largest underground chamber—the Big Room. From colossal stalactite formations hanging like chandeliers to stalagmite structures reaching for the ceiling, every nook and cranny is a masterpiece crafted over millions of years. This UNESCO World Heritage Site also organizes events like bat flight viewings, which allow visitors to watch thousands of bats as they swoop in and out of the cavern. Are you ready to explore the depths?

> Mothers, the perennial source of love and comfort, may not wear capes, but they are the true heroes in our lives. In today's image, we see a mother and baby guanaco, a relative of the llama, roaming the vast grasslands of La Pampa, Argentina. Just like a human mom, a guanaco female is fiercely protective of her child, also known as a 'chulengo.'

> The modern Mother's Day originated in the US in the early 20th century. It came about thanks to the efforts of Anna Jarvis, who wanted to honor the wishes of her late mother, Ann, a social activist who had called for a day to celebrate mothers. In 1908, Anna organized the first Mother's Day service of worship and celebration. In 1914, President Woodrow Wilson officially declared the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day, making it a national holiday.
