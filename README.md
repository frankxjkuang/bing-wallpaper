> The cold, dreary backdrop of winter can be the perfect time to show off a little color. This male mandarin duck is doing just that with his handsome crest and vibrant plumage. Come molting season, he will look more like his brown-and-white female counterpart, except for his brightly colored beak.
> 
> Closely related to the North American wood duck, the mandarin duck is native to East Asia, but populations have been introduced to a variety of European countries as well as the British Isles. This drake is hunkering down in Richmond Park, London, a national nature reserve about three times the size of New York's Central Park, so hopefully he won't have too much trouble finding a mate come spring.

> As twilight turns to night, the city of Paris lights up. Streets and buildings are bathed in light, alongside grand monuments such as the Hôtel National des Invalides, whose famous dome shines out in our homepage image. It was built during the 17th century under Louis XIV, as a hospital and home for army veterans. It was also Louis XIV, known as the Sun King, who ordered streetlights to be erected throughout the city to light up dark alleys where lawbreakers might lurk. Parisians were also asked to put up lanterns and oil lamps, and place lit candles in their windows.
> 
> Today, the City of Light is a dream destination for travelers in search of museums, renowned cuisine, and a touch of romance. This beautiful city is brimming with history as well, serving up stunning gardens, world-famous monuments, and a labyrinth of catacombs beneath the city streets for those who seek to dine out on its cultural offerings.

> As Black History Month winds down, we're remembering the Freedom Sunday rally at Chicago's Soldier Field, which took place on July 10, 1966. More than 30,000 people listened to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. speak powerfully about racial injustices in the housing industry. The Chicago Freedom Movement had begun a year earlier when local civil rights groups invited Dr. King to lead demonstrations against segregation in education and housing as well as employment discrimination. The movement lasted from mid-1965 to early 1967 and is credited with inspiring the Fair Housing Act, passed by Congress in 1968.

> Welcome to Mardi Gras! This festivity marks the end of Carnival season, which is observed in many countries. Mardi Gras is especially big here in New Orleans, where it has been celebrated since the 18th century. Today, the streets of New Orleans will be filled with raucous Mardi Gras parades led by social clubs called 'krewes.' Krewe members atop the floats throw beads and trinkets to cheering crowds along the sidewalks.

> Mardi Gras means 'Fat Tuesday' in French. It refers to the enjoyment of typically decadent foods before the start of 40 traditional days of fasting that go with the season of Lent in the Christian calendar.

> Celebrated on the third Monday of February each year, Presidents Day honors and commemorates US presidents past and present.
> 
> While the holiday originally celebrated George Washington's birthday on February 22, the date was changed so that it always fell on a Monday, allowing the average working American to enjoy more long weekends during the year (and we surely aren't complaining).
> 
> Presidents Day, much like the Fourth of July, is a great opportunity to remember the country's history and revisit its past and heritage. Also, if you can't wait for July to flaunt your patriotism, this is the perfect day to bring out your favorite red, white, and blue adornments.

> If you ever want to feel insignificant, just think about the sheer size of a humpback whale. With adults growing up to 56 feet long, humpback whales are one of the biggest mammals on Earth. In February, Hawaii celebrates the return of these migrating giants with its Maui Whale Festival. This month-long event encourages people to get involved in conservation efforts and includes whale-watching tours, allowing closer views of these beautiful creatures.
> 
> A species of baleen whale, humpback whales are known for their haunting, elaborate songs, which travel vast distances through the ocean. It is only the males that sing and each whale population has its own song. Although the exact purpose is still a mystery, it is thought the songs might allow them to communicate with other whales over vast distances and help navigate new areas. These great leviathans of the deep also share a common ancestor with one of the world's biggest land mammals—they are distant relatives of the hippopotamus.

> The Eben Ice Caves only exist during the freezing winters of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. For the rest of the year, there are only sandstone cliffs and cedar trees here. But when temperatures drop, water flows over the canyon cliffs and turns into these beautiful, colorful ice formations.

> Visitors can walk through the space created between the cliffs and the walls of ice that stretch up to 50 feet high. Make sure to bring your crampons or hiking boots and look out for the local wildlife! Only 3% of Michigan's human population lives in the Upper Peninsula, but the area is teeming with bears, moose, wolves and other animals.
