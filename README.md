> As Christmas draws near, star lanterns begin to appear everywhere—twinkling from balconies, shining in shop windows, and lighting up market stalls. Their shimmer cuts through the long winter nights, filling streets and homes with joy, color, and a sense of togetherness. But behind these festive decorations lies a story as captivating as their glow.
> 
> The first of these stars emerged in Niesky, Germany, in the early 1800s. Students at a Moravian Church boarding school crafted what we now call the Herrnhut Star, or Moravian Star, during a geometry lesson. That 26-pointed marvel, crafted from paper and cardboard, soon came to symbolize the Star of Bethlehem and the spirit of Advent. By 1897, Pieter Verbeek, a former student of that school, began producing and selling them. His son Harry later continued the tradition, founding the Herrnhut Star Factory in 1925.
> 
> From that humble beginning, the tradition spread across Europe and the world. Today's Christmas star lanterns, whether handmade or electric, simple or ornate, echo that same idea. Each one reminds us that even a single spark of light has the power to uplift hearts and brighten the season.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Bormio is a mountain town in northern Italy's Lombardy region, nestled in the Alps near the Stelvio Pass. This location has connected communities across mountain valleys for centuries, shaping how people live and move through the region. Today's image features Bormio's winter landscape, a reflection of its high-altitude setting and enduring bond with the surrounding peaks.
> 
> Its strategic position helped Bormio develop a strong civic identity. For many years, it was one of the 'Three Magnificent Communities,' which held local autonomy and served as an administrative center for nearby settlements. The medieval town layout remains visible in its stone buildings and public spaces, including the Kuerc Square, where community decisions were once made. These structures reflect how governance and daily life adapted to the challenges of a mountain environment.
> 
> Bormio is also known for its natural hot springs that have been documented since Roman times. Historic bathhouses, such as the Bagni Vecchi, show how thermal waters supported health, social life, and resilience during harsh winters. Today, the town is part of Stelvio National Park, where its history, landscape, and culture continue to be preserved.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Rock layers formed over millions of years and a massive bend in the Earth's crust give this desert a rare window into geologic history. This is Capitol Reef National Park in Utah, where sandstone cliffs and canyons preserve a striking record of the planet's past. December 18 marks the anniversary of its designation as a national park in 1971. Today's featured image highlights the sandstone monoliths of Cathedral Valley, including the Temple of the Sun, part of this extraordinary, protected landscape.
> 
> Capitol Reef takes its name from two defining features: rounded Navajo sandstone domes—within the Waterpocket Fold—that resemble the US Capitol building, and the Fold's ridges that form a 'reef,' which blocked early travel across the desert. Before becoming a national park, the area was designated as a national monument in 1937.
> 
> This anniversary also honors the human history linked to this region. Indigenous communities lived along the Fremont River long before pioneer orchards appeared, leaving petroglyphs carved into canyon walls.

> Who could resist that squishy face? A Eurasian red squirrel perches on a snowy pine branch, paws clutching a pine cone like it's the last snack on Earth. These little acrobats stay busy collecting nuts, seeds, and fungi—feasting on fresh finds in summer and on stored cones through winter.
> 
> Once common across Britain, their numbers have fallen sharply due to competition from gray squirrels and the spread of the squirrelpox virus. Today, these red squirrels are mostly found in northern England and Scotland, with refuges like Kielder and Harwood Forests in Northumberland helping sustain their populations.
> 
> Their bright fur and quick movements have made them favorites in art and children's tales—most famously in Beatrix Potter's 'The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin.' Spotting a red squirrel in the wild feels like seeing a classic winter illustration come to life—tiny paws, a twitching nose, and a tail that seems to have a mind of its own. So the next time you see one, remember that protecting small creatures helps keep the stories they inspire alive.

> They've got long beards, red hats, and a knack for stealing a tad bit of Santa's thunder every Christmas. Meet the gnome—known as 'tomte' in Sweden and 'nisse' in Norway—whose traditions vary across regions. Rooted in Scandinavian folklore, these tiny guardians watch over homes and farms, keeping families safe through long, dark winters. But there's a catch: treat them kindly, or they may play tricks. A warm bowl of porridge on Christmas Eve is their favorite reward. Said to bring luck and laughter, they might even befriend your garden gnomes, since they often resemble them.
> 
> Gnomes are also believed to possess deep knowledge of nature and the secrets of the earth, which explains their role as loyal protectors. Over time, these helpers have swapped their work clothes for red hats and festive charm, evolving into the Christmas gnomes we know today. Handmade with wool, felt, and faux fur, they now fill Christmas markets with color and character. Look closely and you'll notice no two are the same—some mischievous, others sweet, all with stories woven into every seam. So, the next time one catches your eye at a Christmas market, take it as a quiet offer of protection.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Have you ever wondered how canals changed the way cities developed? For thousands of years, people have built canals to transport goods, control water flow, and connect places. From ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt to medieval Europe, they transformed cities like Venice and Bruges into trade hubs. The Netherlands took this even further—by the 17th century, they were designing waterways that shaped cities such as Amsterdam.
> 
> It's no wonder Amsterdam is nicknamed the 'Venice of the North.' The city's 60-mile-long network of canals forms part of the UNESCO-listed Canal District. Mostly flanked by roads on both sides, these routes are now used for tourism and recreation. In the center of the city is the Spiegelgracht canal seen in today's image. It is famous for its art galleries, antique shops, and serene reflections that inspired its name, 'Mirror Canal.' As night falls, bridges and trees glow with festive lights, their reflections shimmering across the calm water. With Christmas just around the corner, these canals resemble glowing strings of history—proof that the past still shines bright in the present.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Each December, thousands swap wrapping paper for binoculars and step outside for a different kind of holiday tradition: the Audubon Christmas Bird Count. Instead of hunting for bargains, they hunt for birds—with pencils, rather than pellets. Started in 1900 by ornithologist Frank M. Chapman, the count offered a peaceful alternative to the Christmas 'side hunts,' where people competed to shoot the most animals. Chapman had a better idea: count them instead. Over a century later, that simple shift has grown into the world's longest-running citizen-science project.
> 
> Between December 14 and January 5, volunteers across the Americas head into designated 15-mile circles to tally every bird they see or hear. From bustling cities to remote forests, participants—known affectionately as 'birders'—log species like chickadees, hawks, and tufted titmice (seen in today's image). The data helps scientists track long-term trends in bird populations, migration patterns, and climate impacts. So this holiday season, if you hear people chirping about Christmas counts, don't assume they're talking calories.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
