<summary>Description</summary>

> Lit by bright New England sunshine, the salt-tolerant grass growing here really stands out against the turquoise sea water lapping against it. Salt marshes are important coastal wetlands that protect shorelines from erosion, are major contributors to the aquatic food web, and provide nurseries for birds, fish, and other wildlife.
> 
> This marshland is located in Gloucester, Massachusetts, America's oldest seaport. Tourists frequenting the tranquil summer vacation spot enjoy freshly caught seafood, stunning beaches, museums, and boating. Though Gloucester may have a sleepy, small-town feel, it's only 45 minutes away from Boston. Oh, and it's pronounced 'Glosster' unless you're from Massachusetts—then it's 'Glosstah.'

<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to the Vale of Edale, home to a small village which marks the starting point of one of the UK's most famous long-distance walks. Edale is one of many dales—or wide valleys—of England's Peak District National Park, a picturesque area where heather moorland and rocky gritstone landscapes sit side-by-side with rolling uplands. From here, walkers set out on the hilly and remote Pennine Way, covering 268 miles along England's wildest landscapes up to the Scottish Borders. But if you don't want to hike that far, excellent walking country surrounds the village itself, which lies to the south of the Peak District's highest point, Kinder Scout.
> 
> Edale is home to about 350 people but while it might look remote, it is easily accessible by train from the nearby cities of Manchester and Sheffield. Its tiny station handles crowds of visitors every year, keen to explore the picturesque hamlets and rolling countryside.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The water pictured crashing down the side of Waimea Canyon, on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, has come from one of the rainiest places on Earth. Waipo'o Falls is fed by water from Mount Wai'ale'ale, a shield volcano whose name means 'overflowing water.' The mountain is often shrouded in clouds and experiences a huge amount of rainfall each year—which helps explains those spectacular rainbows.
> 
> Waimea Canyon is sometimes referred to as the Grand Canyon of the Pacific and while it is considerably smaller than its more famous cousin, it has no shortage of stunning views of crested buttes, deep gorges, and flowing falls. So, if you want to see the true variety of Kauai, leave the beach behind and take the winding Route 550 into the mountains for stunning views of the shore and canyon, before arriving at the lookout to enjoy the best view of Waipo'o Falls. Ideally under a spectacular rainbow.

<summary>Description</summary>

> On International Women's Day, we're at Madrid's iconic Cibeles Fountain and City Hall, which have been lit up in purple—one of the day's official colors, representing justice and dignity. Each year, marchers pass by the Great Mother of the Gods on her chariot drawn by lions, as they turn out in their thousands to campaign for gender equality in Spain's capital city.
> 
> International Women's Day has its roots in the US labor movement in the early 20th century. In 1908, 15,000 women marched in New York City for better working conditions and the right to vote and a national women's day was declared in 1909. The following year, German activist Clara Zetkin put forward the idea of holding an international women's day at a conference in Copenhagen. She got unanimous backing and the first one was celebrated on March 19, 1911, in Austria, Denmark, Switzerland, and Germany. It wasn't until 1975 that it was officially recognised by the United Nations.
> 
> These days, International Women's Day is observed on March 8 in many countries around the world, a date to celebrate women's achievements and to continue to campaign for full gender equality.

For 1,300 years, the local Hani people have carved thousands of these asymmetrical terraces around the contours of the Ailao Mountains in Yunnan province.
> 
> They are fed by a complex irrigation system which brings water from the mountain tops, filling the rice terraces in winter and spring and creating this eye-catching stained-glass-window effect. About 80 Hani villages with traditional thatched houses and farming methods, including buffaloes working the fields, are part of this landscape, where people and nature have worked in harmony for centuries.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The Icelandic horse is a small, unique breed that arrived alongside the first Norse settlers in this island country sometime between 860 and 935 CE. More than 1,000 years later, they remain purebred thanks to strict regulations prohibiting the importation of horses. And once exported, they can never come back—rules designed to stop the spread of disease.
> 
> They have adapted to their chilly surroundings, wrapped up in thick winter coats that they can shed when it warms up in spring. These sturdy animals are also perfectly at home crossing glacial rivers and rough terrain. Icelandic horses come in many colors and it is said by some that their coats reflects their personality. Celebrated in Norse folklore, they have long been seen as a valuable servant and trusted companion. These horses are usually only ridden after they turn 4 years old  and these days are mainly used for racing, exhibiting in horse shows, sheep-herding, and leisure activities.

Japanese cherry trees, known as 'sakura,' reach full bloom in March in the south of the country. Our homepage picture shows cherry blossoms cascading over the moats which surround the Imperial Palace in Tokyo.
