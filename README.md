<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we are celebrating the anniversary of Gateway National Park, which was established on February 22, 2018, in St. Louis, Missouri. The park, which lies along a picturesque stretch of the Mississippi River, commemorates Thomas Jefferson’s idea of a continental nation. At its heart stands the Gateway Arch, a breathtaking 630-foot-tall structure that has become the ultimate symbol of St. Louis. Constructed of stainless steel, it holds the distinction of being the world's tallest arch and Missouri's tallest accessible structure. Finnish American architect Eero Saarinen dreamed up the design back in 1947, and by October 28, 1965, his vision had been brought to life. The arch's futuristic design has long been viewed as a symbol of the automobile era, representing the modern, urban landscape, and the promise of a technologically advanced future.

> From waterfalls to temples, Shivamogga, in the South Indian state of Karnataka, offers experiences waiting to be discovered. Steeped in timeless lore, the city is mentioned in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, epics composed as poems and set in the ancient Hindu kingdoms of India. The region's name itself holds a spiritual significance, derived from the Sanskrit words 'Shiva-Mukha,' meaning the 'face of Shiva,' the Hindu god. It is home to several temples, including the Sharavati Temple, dedicated to Shiva, and a temple in the Kodachadri hills that offers vistas of the Western Ghats mountain range.
> 
> Adding to this landscape is Champaka Sarasi, the monumental pond featured in today's image. It tells a story far beyond its waters. It was built by Venkatappa Nayaka, a member of the Nayakas of Keladi, an important ruling dynasty of early modern Karnataka. The pond was constructed in memory of the king's beloved wife, Champaka. It also has a small stone temple at its center, housing a Shiva linga, an abstract or non-figurative depiction of Shiva. Shivamogga is also renowned for its waterfalls, including Jog Falls, the second-highest plunge waterfall in India.

> Born on this day in 1902, Ansel Adams remains one of the most celebrated photographers in history, renowned for his striking black-and-white images of the American wilderness. His work immortalized the grandeur of national parks like California's Yosemite, pictured here, showcasing the raw beauty of nature with depth and clarity. A pioneer of 'pure photography,' Adams believed in capturing a scene's natural essence without manipulation, a principle he championed through his development of the Zone System—a technique to control exposure and contrast.
> 
> Adams initially aspired to be a concert pianist, but his love for the outdoors—sparked by a family trip to Yosemite in 1916—set him on a path that would redefine landscape photography. Beyond his art, Adams was a passionate environmentalist. His work often served as visual arguments for the preservation of America's wild places. He also played a crucial role in expanding the National Park system, advocating for the establishment of Kings Canyon National Park in California. Adams' legacy continues to inspire photographers and environmentalists alike, reminding us of the power of art to drive change.

> The European river otter is more than just an adorable face in the wild. Found across Europe, Asia, and parts of northern Africa, these otters thrive in clean rivers, lakes, and wetlands, serving as an important indicator of environmental health. They are built for agility, with streamlined bodies, webbed feet, and dense fur that keeps them warm even in icy waters. A single square inch of their fur can hold more than 400,000 hairs, making it one of nature's most effective insulators. River otters were once endangered due to pollution and habitat loss. Thanks to conservation efforts, their populations are rebounding in many regions across Europe.
> 
> Otters are naturally playful, often sliding down snowy or muddy banks and diving underwater to find pebbles to play with. They communicate using a repertoire of whistles, squeaks, and even scent, which also helps them mark their territorial boundaries. If you find yourself near a serene river in their range, keep an eye out—you might just spot one of these elusive river-dwellers.

> The Great Blue Hole, found near the center of Lighthouse Reef off the coast of Belize, is one of nature's most incredible creations. The massive marine sinkhole, 1,043 feet across and 407 feet deep, was formed during the last ice age when a limestone cave system collapsed and rising sea levels flooded the area, leaving behind a striking natural wonder.
> 
> Made famous by explorer Jacques Cousteau in 1971, the Great Blue Hole is now one of the world's top scuba diving destinations. Divers flock here to see its aquamarine waters, stalactites, and diverse marine life, including nurse sharks, reef sharks, and giant groupers. Beyond a depth of 300 feet, a mysterious layer of hydrogen sulfide creates a lifeless, dark zone—an eerie yet fascinating feature. Whether you're an adventurer or a nature lover, the Great Blue Hole is a must-see marvel that displays the beauty and mystery of our planet.

> Presidents' Day, celebrated on the third Monday in February, is a time for Americans to reflect on the legacies of those who have served in the country's highest office. The day is officially Washington's Birthday at the federal level, but it has evolved into a celebration that recognizes the achievements of all US presidents. Parades and patriotic displays are held across the country, and many people take the opportunity to learn about presidential history.
> 
> Today's image takes us to the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC. The figure of Abraham Lincoln, seated and contemplative, surrounded by inscriptions of his famous speeches, is a powerful reminder of his leadership and enduring legacy. Through the columns is a view of the Washington Monument, a 555-foot obelisk that stands tall as a reminder of the first president of the US.

> On the third Sunday of February, World Whale Day highlights the beauty of whales and the challenges they face. This year, on February 16, we honor these majestic creatures, like the humpback whale pictured in today's image, known for its enchanting songs and dramatic breaches. World Whale Day began in 1980 in Maui, Hawaii, led by Greg Kauffman of the Pacific Whale Foundation, to protect humpbacks from extinction. Today, it urges global action on threats like ocean pollution, climate change, and habitat loss.
> 
> Humpbacks can grow up to 55 feet long and weigh as much as 40 tons. They travel nearly 10,000 miles annually, feeding in polar waters and breeding in warmer seas. Though their numbers have partially recovered, they still face challenges like fishing gear entanglement and ship collisions. This World Whale Day let's work to protect these ocean giants and preserve their habitats for future generations.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
