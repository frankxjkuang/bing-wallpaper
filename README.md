<summary>Description</summary>

> In 1956, businessman and conservationist Laurance Rockefeller saw the beauty of St. John, one of the US Virgin Islands in the Caribbean, and knew it had to be preserved. He donated more than 5,000 acres of land to the National Park Service, and today we're marking the 68th anniversary of Virgin Islands National Park. Covering about 60% of St. John and 5,650 acres of submerged lands, the park boasts stunning white-sand beaches, coral reefs, and historic sites.
> 
> On the Reef Bay Trail, hikers can see ancient Taino petroglyphs and old sugar plantation ruins, showcasing the island's colonial past. From an underwater snorkeling trail in Trunk Bay, pictured here, to Maho Bay's turtle-filled waters, the park offers a diverse array of marine adventures.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Every Saturday, the largest artificial lake in Bangladesh comes to life with colors and flavors. Kaptai Lake in Rangamati District is home to the floating market of seasonal fruit seen in today's image. The lake was created in the early 1960s to generate hydropower, submerging not just land and the palace of the king of the Chakmas, Bangladesh's largest ethnic minority group, but a way of life, displacing 100,000 people. Sixty years on and the landscape has changed. This buoyant bazaar has become a livelihood, as farmers navigate their wooden vessels along the bank to engage with eager buyers. You leave with a bag full of fresh fruit or just a bunch of unforgettable memories, whatever floats your boat.

> Let's take a trip to a forest of stones. Sunset Point, seen in today's image, offers sweeping views of the hoodoos of Utah's Bryce Canyon National Park. These rock formations are created by frost weathering and stream erosion, which shape the stone into an otherworldly landscape. Perched at 8,000 to 9,000 feet, this overlook offers a panoramic view of rocky spires in red, orange, and white. The most iconic of them is Thor's Hammer, a hoodoo that overlooks a part of the park known as the 'Silent City.' The Queen's Garden Trail, which leads from Sunset Point to Sunrise Point, offers even more vistas and rock formations, including the Queen Victoria hoodoo. According to the legend told by the Paiute Indigenous people who inhabited this area, hoodoos are people who have been turned to stone for their misdeeds by the trickster Coyote. Whether you're a hiker, a photographer, or simply a traveler, the hoodoos are waiting.

<summary>Description</summary>

> These medieval towers stand tall over San Gimignano, a small town near Siena in north central Italy. In the Middle Ages, a town grew up around a church dedicated to St. Geminianus (San Gimignano in Italian). As well as being a popular stop for pilgrims on their way to Rome, the town prospered thanks to its trade in local Vernaccia wine and in saffron, which is grown in the nearby hills. However, when the Black Death struck in 1348, half the population was lost, slowing the town's development and preserving its medieval character to this day.
> 
> San Gimignano's most recognizable feature is its skyline, made up of 14 towers. These impressive structures were the result of a rivalry between two families, each competing to build the tallest tower-house. By the end of the medieval period, there were 72 towers in the town, although because of wars, other catastrophes, and building projects, many were lost. Today, the tallest tower still standing is the Torre Grossa (Big Tower). Built in 1310, it stands at an incredible 177 feet. It's no wonder that the town is sometimes called the Manhattan of the Middle Ages.

> We're off to a roaring start today: It's International Tiger Day, which aims to protect these magnificent big cats amid threats such as poaching and habitat loss. At the end of the 19th century, there were thought to be around 100,000 tigers in the wild; these days, there are fewer than 6,000.
> 
> Today's image features a pair of tigers in Jim Corbett National Park, which covers approximately 200 square miles in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. India is home to more than 70% of the world's wild tigers, and the park was the first to be included in its initiative to protect them: Project Tiger. There are 256 Bengal tigers here, master predators that play an essential role in the park's ecosystem. Tigers are at the top of the food chain, often hunting large animals like water buffalo and even small elephants. Visitors can book a jungle safari, accompanied by forest rangers.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
