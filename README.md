<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> This imposing structure is the Old Fortress on the Greek island of Corfu, off the western coasts of Greece and Albania. Situated in a strategic location between the Ionian and Adriatic seas, Corfu became one of the most fortified places in Europe amid successive sieges by the Ottoman Empire. The island was ruled by the Republic of Venice for 400 years until the late 18th century, which built forts in Corfu's Old Town to defend its maritime trading interests. They held off three Ottoman sieges in 1537, 1571, and 1716 but have been repaired, rebuilt, and added to over the centuries. The Old Fortress has witnessed the rise and fall of mighty empires for hundreds of years, from the tip of a rocky peninsula jutting into the sea. These days, however, it is home to the public library and Corfu's archives.

<summary>Description</summary>

> With distinctive markings on their shells, western box turtles, such as the one seen here, are among the most widely recognized turtle species and one of two box turtle species in the US. Box turtles are named after their dome-shaped shells which are hinged at the bottom, allowing the shell to close like a box if it needs to hide from predators. They generally live for around 25 years but can survive for more than 50, and there have been reports of some living for 100 years.
> 
> Some turtles may have existed more than 100 million years ago but while they outlived the dinosaurs, more than half of all turtle and tortoise species are now on the verge of extinction. Today is World Turtle Day, an event set up to celebrate these incredible creatures and highlight their disappearing habitats.

> It’s International Day for Biological Diversity, a day to celebrate the variety of life on Earth in all its forms, from bacteria, plants, and animals to entire ecosystems like coral reefs and rainforests. All living things within each ecosystem are interconnected, and we rely on healthy ecosystems for our water, food, medicines, clothes, energy, and shelter. But many species are threatened with extinction and ecosystems are being destroyed, which mean Earth’s rich biodiversity is in decline.
> 
> Our homepage image shows Costa Rica’s Monteverde Cloud Forest, home to about half of all species in the country, including more than 2,500 types of plants and 400 bird species. Here you’ll find jaguars and pumas living alongside sloths, howler monkeys, and the endangered resplendent quetzal. This forest alone represents about 2.5% of the world’s biodiversity, the perfect ambassador for today’s event, which calls on us to rethink our relationship with nature and work to be better stewards of the Earth.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to Paris, France’s ancient capital city, through which flows one of the country’s longest rivers, the Seine. Human habitation here dates back to at least the 3rd century BCE, when a Gallic tribe called the Parisii settled on an island in the middle of the river. Today, that island is known as the Île de la Cité, seen on the left of our photo, and is home to Notre-Dame cathedral, as well as other striking buildings such as the medieval Conciergerie, pictured here.
> 
> It is linked to the Place de l'Hôtel-de-Ville by the Pont d’Arcole, one of 37 bridges connecting the city’s left and right banks. The Pont d’Arcole was built in the 1850s and holds a special place in Parisiennes’ hearts. In 1944, it supported General Jacques-Philippe Leclerc's tanks on their way to liberate Paris.

<summary>Description</summary>

> As flowers start to bloom, you'll hear the soft hum of bees buzzing between them, drinking nectar, and gathering pollen to take back to their hives. Some pollen grains on their bodies get carried between flowering plants, helping them to reproduce, yield better crops, and support other species. The UN proclaimed May 20 as World Bee Day to highlight the importance of these pollinators and the threats they face, including habitat loss, climate change, and pesticide use. Busy bees attend to over 90% of the world’s top 107 crops and are vital to our food supply, but populations worldwide have declined. So today, let's support our industrious friends to help them go about their important work in peace.

> Sumatran rhinos like this one were once plentiful across the forests and swamps of Southeast Asia. But there are thought to be fewer than 80 alive today, surviving only on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Borneo. Logging and hunting have led to their inclusion on the ‘red list’ of more than 42,100 critically endangered species. This one is pictured in Way Kambas National Park, Sumatra, where a rhino sanctuary is home to a tiny population and is the center of a breeding and research program.
> 
> Endangered Species Day highlights the thousands of animals and plants under threat of extinction, as well as conservation success stories. Humpback whales, gray wolves, tigers, and bald eagles have all seen population increases, thanks to conservation efforts. It’s now 50 years since the US passed the Endangered Species Act, a powerful wildlife conservation law. But while it is said to have saved 99 percent of species it protects, the challenges remain — habitat loss, invasive species, and climate change are among ongoing threats. The work continues to bring more animals and plants back from the brink.

> For International Museum Day, we’re featuring the towering aluminum-clad Plaza Carso building, part of the Museo Soumaya in Mexico City. It was built to house Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim’s vast art collection, which includes the largest collection of sculptures by Auguste Rodin outside France. The building, designed by Fernando Romero, is a sculpture in itself. Covered in 16,000 hexagonal aluminum plates, the windowless facade looks stunning and helps protect the artwork inside from intense sunlight. It is one of many eye-catching museum buildings worldwide which attract interest both for their collections and for their creative design.
