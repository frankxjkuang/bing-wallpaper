> Today we're looking back to a time when an eccentric billionaire's dream of reaching new heights was still a novel idea. It was 75 years ago today that Howard Hughes' 'flying boat,' dubbed the 'Spruce Goose,' made its one and only flight. Officially named the Hughes H-4 Hercules, the press persisted in calling it the 'Spruce Goose' even though it was constructed almost entirely of birch wood. The plane was commissioned in 1942 by American industrialist Henry Kaiser, who supplied ships to the US during World War II. Kaiser recruited Hughes—the film producer turned pilot, engineer, and business magnate—to build a flying cargo ship that could avoid German submarines while transporting troops and war supplies across the Atlantic. The contract called for three of the planes to be built within two years. Hughes was still working on the design when the war ended—in the end, he delivered only the one in our photo, two years after V-E Day.
> 
> Adjusted for inflation, the Spruce Goose cost roughly $213 million. It remains the largest flying boat ever built and when it was finished, it had the longest wingspan of any previously built aircraft at 320 feet, 11 inches. Even though the plane was no longer needed for the war effort, Hughes was committed to seeing it fly, which it did, but just barely. After liftoff, it flew at 135 mph roughly 70 feet above the water. It cruised for about a mile for a whopping 26 seconds. 'I put the sweat of my life into this thing,' Hughes had said just a few months prior, vowing to leave the country if it was a failure. Failure is in the eye of the beholder, however, as Hughes never left and his spending of government funds was considered reasonable, because, technically, the Spruce Goose did fly.

> It may seem odd to celebrate death—after all, it's the end of our personal era. But tell that to people who celebrate the Day of the Dead, or el Día de los Muertos, and they'll smile. They may explain that death is part of the circle of life, and as natural as any other human milestone. As our photo shows, the Day of the Dead is a big holiday in Mexico, where calacas—skeleton figures of musicians, workers, and other folks in merry scenes of everyday 'life'—lurk everywhere for weeks before the main event. Of course, living people also play dead for the day, donning skeleton outfits, masks, and grotesque makeup. Music, processions, and food add to the quirky, fun carnival atmosphere.
> 
> The Day of the Dead has deep roots in Mexico. In Aztec times, for example, the belief was that after people died, they traveled to the Land of the Dead, called Chicunamictlán. Mexico's pre-Hispanic beliefs eventually melded with Catholic celebrations of All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day to create the joyous event celebrated today. Families leave food or other gifts on their loved ones' graves or on homemade altars called 'ofrendas,' welcoming deceased relatives for the day. No wonder it's viewed as a happy holiday—you get to hang out with the spirits of the dearly loved people whom you've lost. (Just don't let Uncle Joe tell one of his jokes.)

> What better way to spend Halloween than with a ghostly apparition in a scary haunted forest? Today we've (ill-advisedly?) wandered into Wychwood, an English forest with more than its share of spooky backstory. Many people walking in these woods have reported unexplained phenomena, such as feeling a hand on their shoulder and turning to find…no one. Or hearing children wailing as they're driven through the forest in a ghostly horse-drawn carriage.
> 
> But maybe the most spine-tingling yarn linked to Wychwood is that of Amy Robsart, whose ghost is said to haunt the forest. Born almost 500 years ago, she was the first wife of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, a favorite—and perhaps love interest—of Elizabeth I of England. Robsart died mysteriously from a fall down the stairs in Cumnor Place, the couple's rented home in Oxfordshire, while Dudley was away at the royal court. But was it murder? Suicide? A simple misstep? Theories and conspiracies abound to this day.
> 
> Legend has it that her apparition lingered at the foot of the stairs, screaming, and Dudley never slept in that house again. But later, as he rode through Wychwood one day, the specter of Robsart caught up with him and told him he'd be dead within 10 days—and he was. So, if you find yourself walking in Wychwood this Halloween, or any night, stay clear of ghostly women with dire warnings. [Note: This photo was enhanced with the help of AI image-generating tools.]

> The largest carnivore on land roams the icy north. Polar bears like this one spend much of their lives on sea ice rather than terra firma, stalking their favorite prey: seals. Superbly insulated against the cold, polar bears are uniquely suited for life on the ice—so they're especially vulnerable to a warming planet. Their plight is the focus of Polar Bear Week, observed the first week of every November, bringing attention to these creatures who live far out of sight of most humans.
> 
> Polar bears live in portions of Greenland, Norway, Russia, Alaska, and Canada. Most of Canada's polar bears live near the vast Hudson Bay, seen here near the delta of the Seal River. As summer ends, hungry bears who have been living on fat reserves for months gather on the shores of Hudson Bay, waiting for ice to form so they can return to the hunt. Due to climate change, the ice-free period of summer has grown longer, cutting short the bears' hunting season and making human-bear encounters more likely. And while the latter may seem like good news for bear-watchers, these maritime beasts are best viewed from afar.

> Swimming into view like an oceanic Halloween specter, today's 'sea angel' is one of about 3,000 sea slug species. Sea slugs can be found in all the oceans and seas of the world. Scientifically known as nudibranchs, sea slugs are mollusks and today is the day the world celebrates them. What, you didn't know? Perhaps that's because technically it's the birthday of the premier authority on all things related to sea slugs, Terry Gosliner. Gosliner has identified nearly half of the known sea slug species in the world, has written 150 scientific papers about them, and has personally named around 350 individual species. 'Everything about them just piques the imagination,' he says. So, we're saying 'Happy birthday, Terry' by taking a moment to examine the sea angel.
> 
> Sea angels are classified in six different families, and they're all remarkably small, with the largest being only about 3 inches long. They can be found anywhere from under the ice in arctic waters to tropical seas and all points in between. Gelatinous in nature, they're also mostly see-through. You see those 'wings' there in the photo? They allow the sea angel to 'fly' around in the water at about 0.22 mph, which may not seem very fast, but it's about twice as fast as its most common prey, the sea butterfly. Belying their name, these angels are ambush predators that actively attack and extract sea butterflies (technically sea snails) from their shells. Some species of sea angels emit a toxin to keep predators away, which has caused other sea creatures to carry them around as a sort of underwater pepper spray to fend off their own predators. Given this, maybe 'sea guardian angel' would be a more fitting name. Someone call Terry.

> If the sight of storm clouds gathering over Lake Geneva puts you in a dark mood, then you have an idea of Mary Shelley's frame of mind when she conceived the story that would become her seminal work. While Shelley wrote several historical novels and travel books, it was this macabre story of a grotesque creature that made her legacy.
> 
> Today and every final Friday of October is Frankenstein Friday, a celebration of Shelley's 1818 novel about a doctor who reanimates the dead—a tale of terror that many also think of as the first science fiction novel.  Shelley concocted the concept for 'Frankenstein' (aka 'The Modern Prometheus') at Lake Geneva in the northern Alps on the French-Swiss border. She spent an unusually cold and wet summer there in 1816 with her future husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Lord Byron, both poets. Confined indoors, the group challenged one another to come up with ghost stories. Mary Shelley quickly wrote the short story that would become 'Frankenstein,' inspired in no small part by the gloom and chill of Lake Geneva on one dark and stormy night.

> Beneath Venice's Ponte dei Sospiri (Bridge of Sighs) is a popular place to kiss your beloved as a gondolier guides you through the city's canals. But the sighs that the name refers to aren't from staring into your darling's eyes. The enclosed bridge, completed in 1600, connects the Prigioni Nuove (New Prison) to the interrogation rooms in the Doge's Palace, and it is said that a prisoner's last look at beautiful Venice would be from that bridge. And that's reason enough to sigh indeed.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
