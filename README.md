<summary>Description</summary>

> Making a New Year's resolution to boost your fitness? Let us present National Take the Stairs Day. (You're welcome.) The annual event began informally in 2016 and was later adopted by the American Lung Association. It's an ingenious way to nudge people to exercise—most of us encounter stairs during our day, so there's really no excuse. Climbing stairs is a low-impact activity that raises your heart rate and burns calories.
> 
> Of course, you may not have access to a cool, curly staircase like this beauty, which is actually a sculpture rather than a conduit. 'Umschreibung' is tucked away in an office building complex in Munich's Schwanthalerhöhe district. Creator Olafur Eliasson says he intended the sculpture—known locally as 'The Stairway to Heaven'—to convey 'movement without destination, a space defined by motion rather than walls.' Mission accomplished.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Lake Peipus, the fifth-largest lake in Europe, dates back hundreds of millions of years to the Paleozoic Era and is known for its sand dunes, which can 'sing' when the wind blows just right. In the winter the frozen lake surface may feature ice hummocks, as seen in this image. The hummocks are caused by slow, uneven pressure in the ice pack.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Between the more famous national parks of Yellowstone and the Badlands lies Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota. Established 120 years ago, this national park is home to one of only four wild herds of genetically pure bison in North America. The two in our image are the descendants of 20 bison saved from slaughter by conservationists in the early 1900s. At the time, fewer than 1,000 wild bison were left alive out of a population that once numbered 50 million. Above ground, the park is the largest grass prairie in the country. Below ground lies one of the most extensive cave systems in the world. As the weather above changes, air flows into and out of the caves creating the wind for which the park was named.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Gold mining put this Rocky Mountain town on the map in the 1860s, but today the real gold is the powdery snow that falls liberally on the slopes that surround the town. Breckenridge is one of Colorado's premier ski and snowboard destinations. The resort has 35 lifts servicing five peaks and 2,900 acres of terrain. The visitors—who also arrive in the summer to fish, cycle, and paddle—easily outnumber the 5,000 residents of this quaint village. The gold mines have long shut down, apart from hosting visits from tourists. The enduring value of Breckenridge is its natural beauty.

> We're showcasing gorgeous soft wool and mohair yarn because today is Distaff Day, a celebration that dates back to medieval times. Truth be told, we're not convinced that it's really cause for celebration, since it marked women's return to spinning work after Christmas, following 12 blissful, chore-free days.
> 
> The distaff is a tool that predates the invention of the spinning wheel. It holds wool neatly in place before it's spun on the spindle. Distaff Day symbolizes women's vital role in producing textiles for their communities and, just like the distaff, keeping everything in order and running smoothly.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Today's lovely landscape requires a slight bit of explanation. We're at Black Fell, which can be found in the Lake District of England. The term 'fell' originates from the Old Norse term for mountain, but it mostly applies to high, barren areas and, in the Lake District specifically, the area was usually uncultivated and used for grazing. Black Fell, which is a little over 1,000 feet high, has some acclaim, having been mentioned in Alfred Wainwright's 'Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells' as a prime viewing area. No matter which direction you gaze, you're sure to see something wonderful.

> The Harbin International Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival, in China's Heilongjiang province, begins today with all the spectacle and fanfare you'd expect from the world's largest festival of its kind. Big, bold, and beautiful, the event features more than 2,000 ice sculptures made from 240,000 cubic yards of ice collected by nearly a thousand workers from the nearby Songhua River. Many of the sculptures are illuminated with colored lights, creating a vibrant, glowing world of ice. It's estimated the colorful sights attract more than 18 million visitors each year. The event, which runs through late February, also features alpine skiing, cold water swimming in the aforementioned Songhua, as well as a festive ice lantern show.
