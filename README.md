<summary>Description</summary>

> In Minnesota, autumn carries more than crimson leaves—it brings the crisp promise of apple season. From mid-August through late October, orchards across the state open their rows of Honeycrisp, Haralson, and dozens of other cultivars, each bred for flavor, resilience, and charm. Today's image captures that moment: branches heavy with ripe fruit, ready for harvest.
> 
> This land takes its apples seriously. The state apple, the Honeycrisp, now a world favorite, was born in the orchards of the University of Minnesota, where scientists have been cultivating apples for over a century. Throughout the fall, families flock to orchards not only for the fruit but also for hayrides, cider pressing, and the yearly ritual of choosing the perfect apple right from the tree.
> 
> Behind the simple joy lies rigorous cultivation science: here, apple breeding has shaped varieties tough enough for harsh winters and sweet enough to rival any grown elsewhere. There are more than 7,500 cultivars worldwide. Among them, Minnesota's contribution is distinctive—proof that innovation and tradition can flourish side by side, season after season.

> Was it a ceremonial site, a cosmic marker, a symbol of community? Its original purpose remains elusive, and for archaeology, the questions can be as valuable as the answers. Where written records fail, the land tells its story. Silbury Hill preserves these tales, reminding us why studying our past matters: it rewrites what we thought we knew, amplifies silenced voices, and shows us that history is never finished.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Nestled within Michigan's Rock River Canyon Wilderness, Rock River Falls emerges amid a landscape shaped by glaciers, dense woods, and layers of history. In the Upper Peninsula, humans have left their traces for millennia: Indigenous Algonquian-speaking peoples were followed by French and British explorers, and waves of Finnish, Swedish, and French-Canadian immigrants settled there during the 19th-century mining and logging booms. Today, this sparsely populated region hosts barely 3% of Michigan's residents, cradling its forests and waterfalls in near-natural serenity.
> 
> Reaching the falls requires a moderately challenging hike along winding paths lined with towering pines and maples, their shade cooling the ferns and wildflowers below. Red squirrels dart, white-tailed deer move silently, and the calls of loons and pileated woodpeckers echo through the Hiawatha National Forest. At the trail's end, the 18-foot waterfall spills into a clear pool, transformed by seasonal shifts: summer light flickers across the water, autumn sets the canopy ablaze, and winter drapes ice over rocks in glistening formations. At Rock River Falls, each visit offers a fresh sensory journey through the wild soul of northern Michigan.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Think of a cat that can vanish into the forest without a sound—that's the Eurasian lynx. With its tufted ears and a piercing gaze, this feline is the largest of the four lynx species. Stretching up to 42 inches in length and standing as tall as 30 inches at the shoulder, the Eurasian lynx is built for power and precision. Its padded paws aren't just for sneaking; they act like snowshoes, spreading its weight so it can chase down prey in deep winter drifts. Mostly a nocturnal hunter, it spends its days tucked away in thickets or rocky dens, venturing out under the cover of darkness to stalk deer, hares, and squirrels.
> 
> The lynx lives a solitary life. Males and females carve out their own territories, marking them with scratches and scent—like secret notes left in the forest. Their elusive nature did not protect them from humans: during the 1970s and '80s, thousands of lynx pelts were exported from Russia and China, pushing populations toward dangerous lows. Though fur trade restrictions have eased the pressure, poaching, habitat loss, and shrinking prey numbers still pose threats today.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Did you know there's a day just for mushrooms? Every October 15, National Mushroom Day invites us to discover their fascinating world. Take the amethyst laccaria, pictured here. Also known as the amethyst deceiver, its bright purple color is dazzling when young, but it fades with age and weathering, making it tricky to identify. Despite its delicate, ever-changing appearance, this jewel-toned fungus is edible and plays a vital role in the ecosystem.
> 
> Far more than pizza toppings or sautéed sides, these organisms are ecological powerhouses, essential for healthy forests. They break down dead matter, recycle nutrients, and support tree growth through underground networks called mycorrhizae. Some also help store carbon in the soil, playing a role in climate regulation. National Mushroom Day encourages curiosity. So, try a new mushroom recipe today, read about how they support our planet, or enjoy a foraging adventure. Just remember: Always harvest responsibly and never consume wild mushrooms without proper identification, as some can be poisonous.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Ever wondered what it's like to live on a movie set? Oia is about as close as it gets, part of Greece's Santorini archipelago. This village has appeared in films like 'The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants' and 'Tomb Raider,' thanks to its Cycladic houses—cube-shaped homes with flat roofs—and cliffside views that feel almost unreal. Its unique architecture has roots in the late 19th century. Sailors and merchants carved houses right into the volcanic cliffs—cool in summer and warm in winter. The white-and-blue theme is also more than just for show: houses were painted with lime wash so rainwater would run off and be collected. Today, visitors wander its cobbled lanes, explore the Naval Maritime Museum, or climb to the ruins of Agios Nikolaos Castle for unforgettable sunsets.
> 
> Nicknamed the 'Eagle's Nest,' Oia overlooks the volcanic islets of Palia and Nea Kameni, as well as Therasia, which was physically connected to Santorini before the Minoan eruption. And Santorini itself? Think of it as a crown of rock around the sea, a half-sunken caldera shaped by the eruption of 1600 BCE, one of the largest volcanic eruptions in human history.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Canyons and mesas across the US hold more than striking scenery—they carry centuries of Indigenous history. Indigenous Peoples' Day, celebrated nationally on the second Monday of October, honors that history. The holiday began gaining ground in 1992, when Berkeley, California, became the first city to replace Columbus Day with a celebration of Native cultures. It recognizes Native nations as the earliest protectors of the land and acknowledges their ongoing cultural contributions.
> 
> In Utah, nations such as the Navajo, Ute, Paiute, and Hopi maintain deep cultural and spiritual connections to the mesas, rivers, and desert lands. For these communities, the land itself is part of a living heritage—one that reaches back to the Ancestral Puebloans, who lived in what is now the Four Corners region. Renowned for farming, pottery, and architecture, they built multi-room stone dwellings that still stand today. One such site is the House on Fire Ruin in Mule Canyon, pictured here. The rock ceiling above a small cliff dwelling appears ablaze, an illusion created when sunlight hits mineral-stained sandstone. What appears mesmerizing is geology paired with human craftsmanship—an architectural remnant in harmony with its setting.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
