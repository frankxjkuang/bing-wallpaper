> What do giant handshakes painted on the ground have to do with friendship? Quite a lot, actually. Celebrated every July 30, the International Day of Friendship reminds us that tackling global challenges, like poverty, violence, and injustice, starts with something surprisingly simple: human connection. That's exactly what artist Saype had in mind with 'Beyond Walls,' a series of massive, biodegradable land-art murals featuring interlinked hands. Symbolizing unity and solidarity, these works have stretched across five continents. At Expo 2020 Dubai, Saype's 11th installation covered over 16,000 square feet of grass in Al Forsan Park. It formed a striking black-and-white handshake that could only be fully appreciated from above, as seen here. The piece, made with eco-friendly paint, was unveiled on Switzerland's National Day, supported by the Swiss Pavilion.
> 
> Proclaimed by the UN in 2011, the International Day of Friendship calls for building bonds across borders, cultures, and generations. It's a vision of peace crafted not just in policy rooms but also on playgrounds, in neighborhoods, and in public spaces—even on the ground itself. So, today, take a cue from Saype: reach out, connect, and be part of a global human chain. Sometimes, the most powerful message begins with a single gesture.

> Think you can hear silence? Try sitting in a jeep in Kanha National Park in the heart of India, waiting for a Bengal tiger to appear. Every year, International Tiger Day draws attention to these powerful yet endangered big cats. Bengal tigers are more than their unmistakable orange coats and black stripes. They are apex predators, essential to the health and balance of the ecosystems they inhabit. By keeping prey populations like deer and wild boar in check, tigers help shape vegetation patterns and support the overall biodiversity of their environments.
> 
> One of the best places to see this delicate natural balance in action is Kanha National Park. Among India's oldest protected areas, it was first declared a reserve forest in 1879 and later a national park in 1955. It then became one of the first nine tiger reserves under Project Tiger in 1973, a landmark initiative launched to halt the steep decline in the species. Yet, despite decades of progress, tigers still face threats from habitat fragmentation, poaching, and conflict with humans. That's why landscapes like Kanha remain critical—not just for tigers, but for the future of forests and wildlife conservation across the planet.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Every July 28, World Nature Conservation Day reminds us that protecting nature isn't optional—it's essential. Mongolia's vast grasslands, featured today, are a powerful example. These ecosystems are among the largest intact temperate grasslands on Earth, stretching across millions of acres of open steppe. They support around 200,000 nomadic herder families and provide habitat for rare species like the Mongolian gazelle and snow leopard.
> 
> While the day isn't tied to a single founding organization, it aligns with the mission of global conservation leaders like the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which has worked to protect biodiversity since 1948. That mission lives on across Mongolia's open steppe, where nomadic herder families still live in traditional white yurts that dot the grasslands like part of the ecosystem itself. Here, nature isn't just a backdrop—it's home. And Mongolia's grasslands show how people and wildlife can thrive together when ecosystems are respected and protected.

> Being surrounded by a shimmering spiral of silver—that's what it feels like to encounter a school of blackfin barracuda at Shark Reef in Ras Mohammed National Park, Egypt. These streamlined fish, marked by sharp V-shaped stripes, move in near-perfect unison. Their slow, deliberate spirals aren't random—they're an evolutionary strategy that offers both safety in numbers and an edge in hunting. Blackfin barracudas are found throughout tropical waters, from the Red Sea to the central Pacific. During the day, they gather in tight, coordinated groups near the reef, scattering at dusk to pursue prey.
> 
> Ras Mohammed, at the southern tip of Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, is known for much more than striking fish formations. As the country's first marine protected area, it shelters over 1,000 fish species and more than 200 types of coral. The park is considered a living archive of ecological complexity, where even a fleeting school of barracuda reveals a deeper story of life beneath the surface.

> As twilight descends on Walakiri Beach on the island of Sumba, Indonesia, the silhouettes of mangrove trees stand like sentinels in the tide—graceful, resilient, and vital. Today, on International Day for the Conservation of the Mangrove Ecosystem, we honor these extraordinary trees and the critical role they play in sustaining life on our planet.
> 
> Mangroves are nature's coastal guardians. With their arching and salt-filtering roots, they thrive where few trees can—anchored in brackish water, enduring tides and shifting sands. They protect shorelines from erosion, buffer communities against storms, and serve as nurseries for countless marine animals. Their tangled root systems not only stabilize sediment but also provide shelter for juvenile fish, crabs, and birds. Mangroves also trap carbon at rates far higher than most forests, making them powerful allies in the fight against climate change. Yet they are disappearing at an alarming rate due to development, pollution, and rising sea levels. Let this day be a call to action. Whether through education, restoration, or advocacy, we all have a role in preserving these vital ecosystems. Because when we protect mangroves, we protect the future.

> If you're eager to explore faraway landscapes this summer, let us take you to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. This vibrant city is one of the capitals and the most populous city in the Canary Islands, an archipelago belonging to Spain. Located on the northeastern coast of the island of Gran Canaria, Las Palmas is home to over 380,000 people and serves as a major port and commercial hub in the Atlantic. The city's distinctive palette of painted buildings—seen here from above—adds striking color to neighborhoods like Risco de San Juan, where homes are built into the hillsides. Founded in 1478, Las Palmas has a layered history shaped by Spanish colonization, maritime trade, and migration. Today, it is known for its subtropical desert climate—with average temperatures ranging from 60°F in winter to 80°F in summer—and for Las Canteras Beach, one of the best urban beaches in Europe.
> 
> Thanks to its proximity to the African continent, this Spanish island offers insight into two cultures: Spanish customs and African traditions combine to form a unique blend in the heart of the volcanic archipelago.

> Remember the cousin who convinced you to climb the tallest tree or the one who helped you sneak an extra slice of cake at the family reunion? Today is a good time to appreciate those childhood partners in crime who made growing up way more exciting. Cousins often land somewhere between sibling and friend, getting into trouble with you, sharing inside jokes, and showing up at every family gathering. In nature, few creatures mirror that kind of togetherness better than the ashy woodswallow, pictured here. Native to South Asia, these birds are rarely seen alone. They gather in tight groups on bare branches or perch atop high places like powerlines. From there, they launch into graceful flights—flapping and gliding as they snatch insects midair.
> 
> Cousins Day may not come with gift guides or special sales, but it is a great reason to drop a text, make a call, or laugh over a shared memory. Cousins aren't just relatives; they're the ones who make family feel like fun. And just like these snug little woodswallows, life's a little warmer when they're close.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
