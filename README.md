> You can't talk about life on Earth without talking about the ocean. This year, World Oceans Day is being celebrated in Nice, France, just ahead of the UN Ocean Conference starting tomorrow. Officially recognized by the United Nations since 2008, it began as an idea at the 1992 Global Forum, a parallel event at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. This year's theme is 'WONDER: Sustaining What Sustains Us.' It highlights how the ocean supports life as we know it—influencing weather, food chains, and economies.
> 
> Off the coast of Vancouver Island in Canada, Steller sea lions glide through chilly waters, as seen in today's image. These marine mammals are heavy—females average 580 pounds, while males are around 1,200 pounds. Males are noticeably larger than females and are known for their loud roars, thick necks, and flatter snouts. Their deep vocalizations include belching, growling, and snorting to warn others and communicate underwater. Males get loud to defend turf, while moms and pups use unique calls to find each other in a crowded rookery. Despite their size, they're preyed on by orcas and large sharks. These sea lions are considered near-threatened, with populations declining in parts of Alaska. Ocean conservation keeps them—and countless other mammals—afloat.

> Today, we celebrate the paths that connect us with nature and adventure. Angeles National Forest in Southern California is home to towering pines and rugged ridgelines, and hosts a stretch of the legendary Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). Winding over about 2,650 miles from Mexico to Canada, the PCT is the ultimate thru-hiking dream. Designated a National Scenic Trail in 1968, it traverses seven national parks, 25 national forests, and provides a unique lens through which to experience the dramatic landscapes of the American West. But you don't need to go the distance to enjoy its magic. In Southern California, portions of the trail through the San Gabriel Mountains offer great views and rewarding day hikes.
> 
> This year, National Trails Day isn't just about adventure, it's also about stewardship. These trails need our love and care to stay wild and walkable. So, bring a trash bag, join a cleanup drive, or just spread the word about keeping trails pristine and thriving for generations to come.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today, on the anniversary of D-Day, we reflect on one of the most defining moments in modern history. On June 6, 1944, over 156,000 Allied troops landed on the beaches of Normandy, France, launching Operation Overlord, also known as D-Day. This complex assault, involving coordinated air, sea, and land forces, marked the beginning of the campaign to liberate Western Europe from Nazi control.
> 
> One of the key sites was Arromanches-les-Bains, pictured here. Though not among the initial landing beaches, this quiet coastal town became vital in the days that followed. It was here that the Allies built Mulberry harbor B, a massive, temporary port assembled in record time to offload troops, vehicles, and supplies. In the months after D-Day, more than 2.5 million men and 500,000 vehicles landed at Arromanches. Remnants of the harbor still lie offshore, a symbol of the ingenuity and planning behind the operation. Arromanches is also home to the Musée du Débarquement, the first museum dedicated to D-Day and the Battle of Normandy, a place where history lives on through stories of courage and resilience.

<summary>Description</summary>

> A global shoutout to the planet we all call home. On World Environment Day, the world hits pause to reflect and act for a greener future. Led by the United Nations Environment Programme, this day has been observed annually on June 5 since 1973. This year, hosted by the Republic of Korea, the event focuses on ending plastic pollution. Plastic contamination has crept into every part of the world—from oceans and forests to our own bodies in the form of microplastics. This year's campaign aims to spark change at every level of society.
> 
> And that brings us to today's image, a mural that's turning heads and making a difference in Guatire, Venezuela. Local artist Oscar Olivares created one of the world's largest eco-murals, made entirely from plastic bottle caps. The over 4,000-square-foot artwork is made of 400,000 bottle caps and depicts two blue macaws spreading their wings across a once-plain cement wall. Children, seniors, and everyone in between rolled up their sleeves to glue caps, piece by piece, converting waste into something meaningful. Through this project, Olivares not only crafted something beautiful, but also sparked conversations about sustainability and showed people the power of collective action. Because sometimes, a big change starts with something as small as a bottle cap.

> The island of Sardinia in Italy, with its rugged cliffs, secret beaches, and endless shades of blue, is undeniably a Mediterranean treasure. On the island's eastern coast lies Cala Luna, featured here—a beach in the Gulf of Orosei. Rising at the mouth of Rio Illune, this beach is at the end of the Codula di Luna canyon. It is a haven of golden sand, surrounded by white cliffs that rise more than 950 feet into the sky—perfect for rock climbing.
> 
> Here, the waters are shallow at first, before deepening into clear depths ideal for snorkeling, diving, and fishing. In the local Nuoro dialect, the word for 'luna,' Italian for 'moon', is rendered as 'elune,' a name that perfectly captures the essence of the beach's crescent shape.

> If there's one place that brings the cycling spirit to life, it's the Netherlands. For World Bicycle Day, today's image captures bicycles lined up on a bridge in the Dutch city of Utrecht. More than half the journeys around the city happen on bikes, surpassing cars and other modes of travel. Nearly everyone lives within 15 minutes of essentials—and over 90% of residents can reach key places in just 10 minutes. This wasn't always the case. It was only in the 1970s, sparked by an oil crisis, rising car-related issues, and strong social movements, that the Netherlands started prioritizing bikes over cars. Since then, cities have embraced bike-friendly streets, dedicated lanes, and traffic lights for cyclists. And thanks to the famously flat landscape, cycling here feels as natural as walking.

> This year, the first week of June marks National Garden Week—a time to celebrate the joy of gardening and the beauty it brings to our lives. Gardening not only connects us to nature but also boosts our mental health and physical well-being. Just spending time outdoors provides Vitamin D from the sun, which helps our bones stay strong and supports a healthy immune system.
> 
> Pictured here is a skipper butterfly taking a break from its quick, darting flight on a coneflower in New York's Rockefeller State Park Preserve. Native to North America, coneflowers and other members of the Echinacea genus are loved by both gardeners and pollinators for their hardy blooms and spiky centers. Whether you plant a few flowers or create a whole garden, this week is a perfect opportunity to get your hands in the dirt and enjoy the simple pleasures of nature.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
