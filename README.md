> The Taiwan yuhina is a chirpy little bird with an eye-catching crest. Found only on the island of Taiwan, they constantly chatter while feeding and sometimes hang upside-down on cherry trees like bats. Birdwatchers can glimpse the small songbirds at Taiwan’s Alishan National Scenic Area, which features postcard-worthy forest trails and picturesque sunrises.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Located high in the Andes Mountains, Peru's Machu Picchu is believed to have been an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti, who ruled in the mid-15th century. This 'Lost City of the Incas' is one of the world's most famous archaeological sites, an engineering marvel, built without mortar, metal tools, or the wheel. As an icon of Inca civilization, it is a perfect fit for UNESCO's International Day for Monuments and Sites, which has been celebrating important cultural heritage sites for 40 years. Landmarks such as the Pueblo Indian dwellings of Mesa Verde, the Taj Mahal, the Great Pyramid of Giza, and the Parthenon give us the opportunity to look back at the cultures that came before us and preserve their memory for future generations.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Get out your pen and paper—it's International Haiku Poetry Day! Haikus originated in Japan as the opening segment of a larger poem called a renga. Eventually they became individual poems of their own. A traditional haiku consists of 17 phonetic units—similar to a syllable—in a 5, 7, 5 formation. Though simple, a great haiku creates a sense of beauty and a connection to nature. That connection was captured in the artwork seen here, 'One Thousand Springs,' an installation of 5,000 haikus suspended within a web of red threads by artist Chiharu Shiota. It was part of the 2021 Japan Festival at Kew Royal Botanic Gardens in London. Here's some inspiration for you to write a haiku yourself:
> 
> poetry blooms bright / scattered by the vernal winds / may it take strong root

<summary>Description</summary>

> Is there a simpler joy than flying a kite on a windy day? The date of this magical invention is unknown, but the first written documentation of kite flying comes from China in 200 BCE. There they were initially used to measure distance, but over the years they have been tapped for fishing, sport, science, celebration, communication, and recreation. Kites can take many shapes and be made of various materials, but all of them have a wing surface, a tether, and a bridle that keeps the surface at an angle to the wind. In fact, you can easily make your own, and there's no better time than today: Go Fly a Kite Day.

<summary>Description</summary>

> 'Life imitates art far more than art imitates life.' There is perhaps no better day to ponder these iconic words by Oscar Wilde than World Art Day. Celebrated each April 15, it marks the birthday of Renaissance luminary Leonardo da Vinci. The celebration, which started in 2012, continues to be a beautiful reminder of the power of art and its ability to heal, strengthen, and inspire society. The sculpture in today's image, Italian artist Lorenzo Quinn's 'Together,' displayed near the Great Pyramids of Giza, serves as a fitting commentary on this inimitable power of art and also a symbol of the unbreakable human connection.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Sea stars—often called starfish—are some of the most fascinating creatures to live in our oceans. For starters, despite their name, they aren't fish—they belong to a group of marine invertebrates called echinoderms. Like all echinoderms, sea stars are characterized by the radial symmetry of their bodies, which usually have multiple arms extending from the central disc.
> 
> Did you know that sea stars can regenerate their arms? This means if they are attacked by a predator, they can get back into shape eventually (and quite literally). In fact, some species can also regenerate an entirely new sea star from just the arm, provided it still has a bit of the central disc attached to it.

> Phlox subulata is known by many names. While some call it moss pink, others call it creeping phlox, flowering moss, or mountain phlox. No matter what name you know it by, you cannot deny the beauty and charm of these tiny perennial flowers. They bloom in spring and add bright splashes of color wherever they grow.
> 
> This plant's small flowers and carpet-like growth pattern give the appearance of moss; hence, the name. Japan's Hitsujiyama Park in Chichibu is known for shibazakura, as it's known in Japanese. When these flowers are in full bloom, they cover the rolling hills in the park and offer a breathtaking horticultural view.
