> It's Groundhog Day … again. Today, Americans and Canadians rely on the prognostication skills of Punxsutawney Phil to determine if winter will hang on. Phil is a famous groundhog, also known as a woodchuck, and legend has it that if he emerges from his burrow February 2 and sees his own shadow, he'll go back to sleep for another six weeks of winter. If he doesn't, it will be an early spring. German immigrants brought the custom to America, where it was first celebrated in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, in 1887. Historically, Europeans celebrated February 2 as the first day of spring, and Germans originally watched badgers and other small animals for signs of seasonal change important to farmers. The Germans who settled in Pennsylvania in the 18th and 19th centuries chose the area's native groundhog for this task.

> The alpine marmot in today's image is a close relative of the groundhog, which is another species of marmot. Marmots are the heaviest members of the squirrel family, and the alpine species is native to central and southern Europe. Its North American cousin, the groundhog, is a highly intelligent lowland rodent that forms intricate social networks, but it's a so-so weather forecaster.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today, the United States begins an annual, monthlong celebration of African Americans and their contributions to the country's history and culture. The forerunner of Black History Month was created in 1926 by historian Carter Woodson and minister Jesse Moorland to study and promote the legacy of Black Americans. The weeklong celebration was observed in the second week of February to coincide with the birthdays of President Abraham Lincoln and African American abolitionist Frederick Douglass. Its popularity grew over the next 50 years in large part because of the civil rights movement, and President Gerald Ford expanded it to a full month in 1976. Other countries honor their own Black histories, including Canada, which also celebrates Black History Month throughout February.
> 
> Seen in today's image, the National Museum of African American History & Culture is an excellent resource to learn about African American pioneers. Part of the Smithsonian Institution and found on the National Mall in Washington, DC, the museum was opened in a 2016 ceremony led by President Barack Obama. It's the world's largest African American museum with more than 40,000 artifacts and offers free daily admission with online reservations.

> Celebrate the beauty of zebras on International Zebra Day! These striking animals, known for their unique black and white patterns, are mostly found in the African savanna, stretching from Kenya to South Africa. Of the three zebra species, Grévy's zebra, plains zebra, and mountain zebra, the Grévy's zebra is the most endangered, with more than half its population lost in only three decades. While plains zebras are thriving, mountain zebras face significant threats, such as poaching and habitat encroachment. Zebras play an essential role in the ecosystems they live in, coexisting with predators like lions and hyenas while shaping the grasslands they call home.
> 
> In today's picture, we see two plains zebras—which are anything but plain—at sunrise in Mokala National Park, South Africa. International Zebra Day raises awareness about the challenges these animals face and encourages conservation efforts to ensure their survival. Whether by learning more or supporting wildlife initiatives, we can all play a role in protecting these fascinating creatures.

> High up in the Pyrenees, there is a gap in the mountains. More than 300 feet tall and 131 feet across, La Brecha de Rolando (Roland's Breach), featured here today, is a sight to behold. But who was Roland? Count Roland was a Frankish military leader during Charlemagne's reign in the 8th century. Legend has it that, after being defeated in battle, Roland cut a gap in the mountains—either to destroy his sword or to catch one last glimpse of France.
> 
> Roland's Breach lies within the Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park in Spain, right on the border with France. Covering more than 38,000 acres, the park is home to some spectacular limestone formations. It's made up of four different valleys and one peak—Monte Perdido—which towers more than 11,000 feet above sea level. It even has its own glacier, Monte Perdido, which is the fourth largest in the Pyrenees. A wide range of animals live in this mountainous landscape, including wild boars, Pyrenean chamois, and brown bears.

> The streets come alive today with a symphony of firecrackers, red lanterns, and cheerful chatter—it's Chinese New Year. Steeped in thousands of years of tradition, this holiday marks the start of the lunisolar Chinese calendar. One of the most captivating images associated with this festival is the dragon dance, pictured here. Skilled dancers manipulate a long, flexible dragon puppet, bringing it to life with sinuous, undulating movements. The dragon, a symbol of power, dignity, and good fortune, is believed to bring luck to the community, with longer dragons bringing even more prosperity.
> 
> The festivities of the Chinese New Year aren't confined to China alone; they resonate across the globe, from the streets of Singapore to the Chinatowns of New York, San Francisco, and London. Each place adds its unique twist, but the core traditions remain the same: family reunions, sumptuous feasts, and the exchange of hongbao—red envelopes filled with money. This blend of ancient customs and modern practices unites people in joy and hope for the year ahead.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The short-eared owl, featured in today's image, is a grassland-dwelling member of the owl family. Found on all continents except Antarctica and Australia, it's one of the most widely distributed bird species. This raptor belongs to the genus Asio, whose members are characterized by feather tufts ('ears') on their head. The short-eared owl only reveals its tufts when feeling defensive.
> 
> Irregular wingbeats cause its flight to be on the floppy side, like a moth or bat. It likes to glide a few feet above the ground in open fields and grasslands, swooping down feet first to grab its prey. Owls primarily hunt at night, but this silent hunter is also active during the day and at dusk. Its daylight hunts often line up with the peak activity of small rodents called voles—its favorite meal. Known to relocate to areas with higher rodent populations, the short-eared owl even wanders nomadically in search of better food supplies during years when vole populations are low.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Carved by the Colorado River, nearly 2 billion years of Earth's history are exposed in the layers of the Grand Canyon. While geologists continue to debate parts of the formation story of the canyon, recent studies suggest the river carved its path through the region about 5 to 6 million years ago. Since then, the river has been deepening and widening the canyon while sculpting its dramatic geographic features.
> 
> Today, the Grand Canyon is much more than just a massive chasm with exceptional vistas. It's home to some stunning geographic features, like Zoroaster Temple, featured in today's image. This towering 7,123-foot summit is in Coconino County, Arizona. The peak was named after the ancient Iranian prophet Zoroaster by George Wharton James, an American photographer and journalist, and Clarence Dutton, an American geologist. Rick Tidrick and Dave Ganci made the first summit ascent of Zoroaster Temple in September 1958. This triumph marked the Grand Canyon's first technical climb, turning it into a hotspot and igniting a wave of summit-chasing climbers.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
