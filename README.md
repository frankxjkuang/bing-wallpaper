> On July 11, 1987, the world is thought to have welcomed its 5-billionth person. Thirty-six years later, our population has reached 8 billion and is still rising. World Population Day, established by the UN, is a day to reflect on how much life Earth can sustain, and how our lives impact our environment.
> 
> Pictured here is Hong Kong, a city recognized as one of the world's most densely populated areas, with approximately 17,582 people per square mile. Though Hong Kong has a low birth rate, the density remains high as people live longer thanks to improvements in healthcare, a contributing factor to population increases worldwide. While this colorful night scene might appear glamorous, it is also an example of light pollution, which can disrupt ecosystems and affect our health—one of humanity's many impacts on the world around us.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Delighting the senses with its vibrant hues and fragrant blooms, lavender is thought to have arrived in England with the Romans, around 2,000 years ago. While it’s nice to look at, the Romans likely brought it with them for its many practical uses, including cooking, repelling insects, and as an antiseptic. Many perfumes, modern and historical, have featured lavender, and Queen Elizabeth I is purported to have used lavender scent. You’ll find lavender fields scattered across the country. This one is a typical example, a quintessential summer sight here in the picturesque county of Somerset, in southwest England.

> Happy World Chocolate Day! Hidden inside these colorful pods are cocoa seeds, or beans, which will be fermented, roasted, and ground on their way to being turned into chocolate, a sweet treat with a worldwide fanbase.
> 
> Chocolate has a fascinating history. Its origins can be traced back to the Indigenous Olmec people of Mesoamerica, who dried and fermented the seeds of the cacao tree to create an unsweetened alcoholic beverage. The solid chocolate bars we love today came much later, in the 19th century, when J.S. Fry and Sons put them into production. The company created its first solid bar in 1847, closely followed in 1849 by rival firm Cadbury. Things snowballed from there and today, we are spoiled for choice. So, whether you prefer the creamy sweetness of milk chocolate, or the bitterness of super dark chocolate, today is the perfect time to indulge yourself in this delicious confection.

> This photograph captures a heartwarming moment between two southern rockhopper penguins, the perfect image for International Kissing Day. Why do we kiss? Well, dozens of cultures don't kiss on the lips at all. For those that do, theories range widely, from the chemical reactions in the brain, to ancient ancestral parents chewing food for their children, to simply smelling each other. Of course, no scientific explanation can capture the magic of a shared kiss. Perhaps that's why artists including Prince, Faith Hill, and Hall & Oates have all had chart-toppers about lip-locking; they have found a way to put an indescribable feeling into words.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Porto Timoni beach, in Corfu, Greece, is a hidden gem reached either by boat, or by hiking from the historic village of Afionas. Those who make the journey are rewarded with two stunning coves, offering a unique double-beach experience. With clear turquoise waters and dramatic cliffs, Porto Timoni presents a picturesque coastal panorama. Surrounding the beach, lush olive groves and cypress trees add to its charm. Greek islands like Corfu may seem timeless and ancient but they are relatively new in the history of Earth. A leading theory is that around 5.3 million years ago, a great flood poured in between Africa and Europe from the Atlantic Ocean, an event called the Zanclean flood. Lakes became oceans and what were previously mountaintops became islands.
