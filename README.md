> It's Holi; get ready to become a walking rainbow and sprinkle joy wherever you go! This festival of colors, spring, and love is a cornerstone of Indian and Nepali culture. It is also celebrated in other countries with large Hindu populations, such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, the US, the UK, Suriname, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Festivities last for a night and a day, starting on the evening of the last full moon in the Hindu calendar month of Phalguna, which usually falls in March in the Gregorian calendar. As the sun sets, people gather to light bonfires, a ritual known as Holika Dahan, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil. The following day, the streets come alive with people splashing each other in colors, giving everyone a vibrant makeover. Are you ready for the hues of Holi?

> Yellow, round, tiny, and gregarious—say hello to these silvereyes enjoying cherry blossoms in South Korea. While this family of passerine birds is native to Africa, Australasia, and Asia, several of its species can be found in places like French Polynesia and Hawaii, where they appeared by introduction. Also known as white-eyes or wax-eyes, these birds come in a range of colors and patterns, but they all share that trademark eye ring. They have a sweet tooth for nectar, but they're not picky eaters, happily feeding on fruits, insects, and berries. Let's celebrate these beauties for adding a touch of wonder to spring!

> 'When clouds appear like rocks and towers, the Earth's refreshed with frequent showers.' There's a whisper of truth to this old proverb for the storm clouds, also known as cumulonimbus or anvil clouds, which are pictured here. Today, on World Meteorological Day, we honor the marvel that is our atmosphere. This observance, first held in 1961, commemorates the establishment of the World Meteorological Organization and recognizes the vital role meteorology plays in our lives. Weather forecasts may not always appear reliable, but thanks to advances in technology like satellites and supercomputers, they have come a long way. Global weather models provide forecasts for up to 16 days and, the average lead time for tornado warnings is now around 15 minutes. Cheers for the progress made and much more to come!

> It's World Water Day, a United Nations event that ripples across the globe, reminding us of the importance of this essential resource. Water quenches thirst and irrigates harvests, and its absence can derail prosperity and stability. The World Economic Forum lists the water crisis among the top global risks, with 2.2 billion people still lacking access to clean water. From educational forums to local cleanups, each action, big or small, contributes to the wave of change needed to address the crisis. This year's theme, 'Water for Peace,' invites us to reflect on water's power to foster unity. So, are you ready to dive into a current that flows deeper than New Zealand's Blue Spring at Te Waihou Walkway, pictured on our homepage? This clear spring is renowned for its purity, supplying about 70% of the country's bottled water. For those in regions without easy access to safe water, World Water Day is here to promote greater cooperation to help conserve this crucial resource, for everyone.

> Today we're rooting for woodlands worldwide as we celebrate the International Day of Forests. Established by the UN 11 years ago, the day draws attention to the need to preserve these essential ecosystems, which supply food, water, medicines, and other resources. Covering over 30% of land on Earth, it is thought that woodlands around the world contain more than 60,000 tree species. Featured here is the Bwindi Impenetrable National Forest in Uganda, which is home to 160 species of trees and 100 species of ferns, as well as an extraordinary 50% of the world's mountain gorilla population. The forest has thickets of bamboo growing between the trees, making access on foot difficult, giving the Impenetrable Forest its name.

> Want to experience spring in all its glory? If you head to the National Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington, DC, you're in for a blooming good time! The festival commemorates the 3,000 cherry trees given to the city by the mayor of Tokyo in 1912. Twelve varieties were originally gifted but these days most of the trees are either Yoshino or Kwanzan cherries. Those circling the Tidal Basin, the location of the Jefferson Memorial featured in today's image, are Yoshino trees. The event has evolved to become a four-week celebration that attracts over 1.5 million people every year. The highlights of the festival include a lively parade filled with large, colorful helium balloons, stunning floats, and marching bands from all over the country.

> Goodbye winter! Today marks the spring or vernal equinox, the official beginning of springtime in the Northern Hemisphere. Starting today, regions north of the equator will have longer days than nights.
> 
> In some parts of the world, the arrival of spring is announced by the guttural chorus of tree frogs. They tend to be small and slender since their weight has to be supported by branches and twigs in their habitats. They can be recognized by the sticky discs on the tips of their fingers and toes, which help them cling to surfaces. The American green tree frog is the official state amphibian of both Louisiana and Georgia.

Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
