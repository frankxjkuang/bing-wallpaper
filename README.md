> Known as nature's engineers, beavers have been shaping the world for millions of years. Historically, North American beavers faced challenges from humans. They were hunted for their fur, and their 'nuisance' freshwater abodes were destroyed. However, these buck-toothed, paddle-tailed dam builders have been gaining new respect in recent years. These animals have beneficial effects not only on water quality but also on land. With their iron-coated orange incisors, beavers fell trees, diligently constructing not just homes but habitats. Their dams create life-sustaining wetlands for countless species. Meanwhile, their lodges are masterpieces of security and comfort, the entrance strategically submerged to deter predators and provide privacy. The rodents have no trouble getting in, as they can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes. So, 'woodn't' it be nice to give a shout-out to these creatures on International Beaver Day?

> From Strawberry Day to Cat Day and even Vegetable Day, Japan has a list of faux holidays, which are the clever results of 'dajare' or word plays. Today's date, April 6, makes up the Japanese word for castle, 'shiro' from 'shi' (4) and 'ro' (6). Hence, the celebration of castles. What better opportunity than Castle Day, to learn about the country's largest and most-visited castle, Himeji Castle? Dating back to 1333, this UNESCO World Heritage Site boasts an advanced defensive design and five National Treasure structures. The castle has also withstood time and nature's fury, surviving the bombings of World War II and the Great Hanshin earthquake in 1995. Nearly 700 years of glory, local legends, and ghost stories reverberate through the 83 rooms of this hilltop fortress. Would you care to explore?

> With their elegant leaps and graceful movements, lechwe are the epitome of agility and poise on the African savanna. These antelopes, known for their distinctive reddish-brown coats and lyre-shaped horns, are native to the wetlands and floodplains of south-central Africa, including the Okavango Delta in Botswana, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Lechwe are social animals, often found in herds of thousands. In the heart of the delta, they are an integral part of the region's rich biodiversity, coexisting with other species like elephants, lions, rhinos, and hippos, wading through the water. Their presence adds to the delta's natural allure, which draws in thousands of safari enthusiasts, and is proof of wildlife's resilience in the face of environmental challenges.

On Find a Rainbow Day, people take part in activities like searching for rainbows after rainfall or creating rainbow-themed art.

> Today's homepage takes us to Jutland, Denmark, where the arrival of spring showcases the green hues of the European beech, a national symbol of this northern land. The young leaves of these budding trees are significant to the Danish people, as they are harvested from April to May and used in cooking—particularly in salads. In the past, Europeans would often use the smooth bark of beech trees for writings texts and the word 'book' is thought to be derived from the word for 'beech.' As the sun shines through the forest canopy, wild anemones brighten up the woodland with their white petals. These blooms, representing delicate beauty and sincerity, have even starred in masterpieces by artists such as Monet and Vincent van Gogh.
