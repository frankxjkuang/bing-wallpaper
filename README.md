<summary>Description</summary>

> Carved by time, wind, and water, Capitol Reef National Park showcases rust-hued cliffs and the natural beauty of the American West. The park was named after a series of Navajo sandstone domes said to resemble the US Capitol Building and the Waterpocket Fold, a huge ridge in the Earth's crust, which was referred to as a reef by prospectors. This 100-mile-long monocline—a step-like fold—is thought to have formed around 50 to 70 million years ago, and is home to towering cliffs, narrow canyons, and colorful rock formations. Capitol Reef was established as a national monument in 1937 and was designated a national park on December 18, 1971.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Among their feathered friends, Bohemian waxwings cut striking figures with their pointed crests, 'blushing' faces, and velvety gray plumage with splashes of color. Large groups wander across the northern US and Canada in search of food, swooping on trees and shrubs to find fruit. In winter, they feast upon cotoneaster, juniper, and rowan berries. As spring casts its spell, these nomads settle down for the breeding season. The female waxwings craft the nests, laying two to six bluish-gray eggs, and hatchlings are fed a diet of insects and fruits by both parents. One can easily spot these sociable birds, as they often gather in chirpy flocks in North America and Eurasia.

> During the holiday season, poinsettias brighten up homes in suitably festive coloring, serving as symbols of goodwill. December 12 marks National Poinsettia Day, a special occasion to celebrate this holiday favorite. The plant was introduced to the US by Joel Roberts Poinsett, a botanist and former minister to Mexico who died on this day in 1851. Poinsettias can be found growing in the wild from Mexico to Guatemala. The ancestors of the modern, commercially available version have been traced to the Mexican state of Guerrero. The crimson-leaved plant was used by the Aztecs as a red dye and as a fever-reducing medicine.
