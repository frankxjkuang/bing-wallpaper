<summary>Description</summary>

> You may be surprised to learn that this elegant plant dappled with water droplets is a variety of moss: Tortula muralis, better known as wall screw-moss. It's found all over the world, even in urban areas where more sensitive mosses have a hard time thriving because of dry soil and air pollution. Mosses in general are accurate monitors of air pollution—they absorb air and water, so contaminants can also be measured in their cells.
> 
> Wall screw-moss is just one of at least 12,000 species of moss, ancient plants that date back 450 million years. The hardy bunch has weathered climate swings for eons, capable of surviving in icy tundra or scorching desert plains. They don't have roots—instead, they absorb moisture through hairlike rhizoids (which also act as anchors) on their surface. This ability to suck in water so efficiently makes mosses among the first plants to recover from forest fires or extreme heat, spreading out to stabilize the soil and keep it hydrated for other plants.
> 
> How appropriate, then, that our photograph captured raindrops on the moss. This is a perfect example of what's known as macro photography, when the image is many times larger than life-size. All the better to enjoy the delicate beauty of nature.

<summary>Description</summary>

> We're celebrating Indigenous Peoples' Day by peering through the sculpture called 'Circle of Sacred Smoke' aka 'Wind Circle' or 'Circle Wind' at Devils Tower, one of the most famous rock monoliths in the US. The 'Circle,' sculpted by Japanese artist Junkyu Muto and installed in 2008, is the third of seven 'peace sculptures' placed around the world. Twelve feet high and made of white marble, it's intended to evoke a puff of smoke from a Native American ceremonial pipe.
> 
> Devils Tower is a majestic Wyoming butte considered sacred by Indigenous tribes of the Great Plains like the Cheyenne, Crow, Lakota, and Kiowa. In myth, Devils Tower is associated not with the devil but with a great bear: Crow and Cheyenne names for it translate to Bear's House, Bear's Lodge, or Bear's Lair. The vertical grooves in the tower are said to be the bear's claw marks.

> Hundreds of shades of blue are marbled together in this cool shot. No, it's not a work of modern art, it's right off the brush of nature. This is a satellite photo of phytoplankton blooming near Alaska as the cool, salty Chukchi Sea mingles with warmer, fresher water closer to shore.
> 
> But just what are phytoplankton? They're microscopic sun-powered organisms that float near the surface of the ocean, drifting with the currents. In fact, their name derives from the Greek 'phyton' for plant and 'planktos' for wanderer or drifter. Delicious and nutritious to various creatures living in oceans and estuaries, they're also vital to everyone on Earth: Phytoplankton are responsible for about half of the world's photosynthesis, the sun-powered process that takes in carbon dioxide and releases oxygen.
> 
> We're talking phytoplankton today in honor of Earth Science Week, an international event encouraging all of us to learn about or even devote our lives to the Earth sciences. This year's theme is 'Earth Science for a Sustainable World,' emphasizing science's role in sustaining our planet. So, time to dust off that microscope and visit your local science museum, or perhaps just learn more about beautiful, swirling phytoplankton.

<summary>Description</summary>

> One of the least understood of sea creatures, this glass octopus lives in the depths of the ocean where sunlight can't reach, about 3,000 feet down. Glass octopuses are rarely seen and difficult to observe, but they're a great example of the diversity of the order Octopoda, which we're celebrating today on World Octopus Day. The observance comes around, appropriately, every Oct 8.
> 
> The more we learn about octopuses, the more fascinating they reveal themselves to be. They're among the most intelligent and behaviorally diverse creatures in the sea. Octopuses can remember and recognize individual humans and are among the very few animals known to be able to use tools. Some, like the giant Pacific octopus, are enormous, and some are tiny. They live in a variety of habitats, from tidal pools to the deepest abyss of the ocean.
> 
> In the darkness where they live, glass octopuses are nearly invisible, which helps them elude predators like bottlenose whales. Only their eyes give them away. The species is relatively small, with a mantle (the bulbous 'head' that houses the animal's organs) about 4 inches long and a total length of about 18 inches. And their lives, like those of most octopus species, are brief—just a few years. They grow quickly, mature early, reproduce, and die soon after that, never seeing the light of day.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The double-decker Oberbaum Bridge is one of Berlin's most beloved and iconic landmarks. For centuries the Oberbaum Bridge connected the two districts of Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg until they were separated by the Berlin Wall from 1961 to 1989. The first bridge at this spot was built in the 1700s, although the current road-and-rail Oberbaum was constructed at the end of the 19th century.
> 
> It remains an important symbol of unified Berlin, and a prominently featured landmark in the city's annual, weeklong Festival of Lights, which begins today. The international festival, now in its 18th year, transforms Berlin's buildings and landmarks with artful displays of light, as colors, patterns, and images are projected onto structures across the city. Here we see the Oberbaum all lit up for the 2020 festival—a far cry from its Cold War days. Despite growing concerns about an energy crisis in Germany this winter, Berlin's Festival of Lights will go on as planned in 2022, though in a scaled-down version, according to officials at the city government.

> Class trip? Looks like this teacher has their youngsters in line. If only it were always this easy.... Today is World Teachers' Day, and we're celebrating educators of all kinds. This year's theme is 'Teachers at the heart of educational renewal,' and it highlights the remarkable efforts of teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine. They've had to balance health and safety concerns with an abrupt switch to remote learning or partial in-person classes, all while focusing on the education and well-being of their students.
> 
> Our flamingo teacher here may not have had to worry about COVID, but they certainly have their wings full. Though their gray charges don't look flamingo-y yet, they will. Flamingo youngsters, like those here at the Ría Lagartos Biosphere Reserve in Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula, develop the coloration of adults at around 1 to 2 years of age, so those trademark pink feathers will soon start to appear. The hot-pink coloring comes from the flamingo diet: They eat food that contains a lot of alpha and beta carotenoid pigments, such as algae, bugs, crustaceans, and mollusks.
