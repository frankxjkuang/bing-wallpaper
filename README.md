<summary>Description</summary>

> If you're chasing sunsets and jaw-dropping views, come to Alstrom Point. Located in southern Utah's Kane County, this spot in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area stands at an impressive height of 4,685 feet. Made mostly of Entrada Sandstone, it has the same geological roots as nearby sites like Romana Mesa, its parent peak, and Gunsight Butte, another sandstone summit to the east.
> 
> Part of the Lake Powell region, Alstrom Point extends southward into the vast waters of the lake, in between Padre Bay and Warm Creek Bay. When the lake is full, Alstrom Point towers nearly 1,000 feet above the water, offering views of the surrounding canyons. Lake Powell, spanning across Utah and Arizona, attracts around 3 million visitors every year. The lake is a maze of deep blue water winding through over 90 rock canyons. While its main stretch runs through Glen Canyon, it also snakes into over many smaller side canyons, along with the Escalante and San Juan Rivers.

> Winter turns Mestia's medieval towers into icy fortresses. Perched 4,921 feet up in the Caucasus Mountains, Mestia is a charming highland town in northwest Georgia. The town is home to the Svans, a cultural and linguistic subgroup of Georgians. Despite its modest size, Mestia has been an essential hub of Georgian culture for centuries, dotted with the Svan defensive towers, seen in today's image. Most of these towers were constructed between the 9th and 12th centuries, a period often referred to as Georgia's Golden Age. However, their roots are believed to stretch even further back, possibly into prehistoric times. Built for both protection and shelter, these towers were not just fortresses but also integral parts of family homes, reflecting the region's history of resilience and self-sufficiency. Therefore, it isn't just a town; it's a living museum where history rises from these towers and echoes through the mountains.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In Norway, winter isn't just a season—it's an experience. In the north of the country, nights stretch for 20 hours, and there are entire weeks when the sun remains hidden below the horizon. It might sound bleak, but it's a unique time of the year. Why? Because around early afternoon, usually between 1 and 2 PM, a soft, lingering light reflects off the snow-covered ground and the deep blue sea. This forms a breathtaking, glassy blue glow that settles over the landscape. Each day, the blue hour arrives just a little later, a gentle reminder that the sun is slowly preparing to reclaim the sky.
> 
> Featured here is Trondheim's blue hour. The city lies on the southern shore of the Trondheimsfjord and is framed by the gentle curves of the Nidelva River. Founded in 997 CE as a trading post, Trondheim was Norway's capital during the Viking Age and remained so until 1217. While its coastal climate keeps winters relatively mild, Trondheim's nearby hills offer a colder, snowier microclimate perfect for winter sports enthusiasts.

> What do you get when you bring together more than 500 Māori chiefs, representatives of the British Crown, and a treaty signed in 1840? A day that New Zealanders still commemorate: Waitangi Day. On this date, the Treaty of Waitangi was signed, establishing the principles for how the two cultures would coexist. Ceremonies are held at Waitangi Treaty Grounds—where the document was signed—featuring traditional Māori performances, speeches, and the ever-dramatic waka (canoe) races. From festivals and concerts in cities like Auckland and Wellington to low-key community gatherings, the spirit of the day is about connection and culture.
> 
> What's better than celebrating New Zealand's history on Waitangi Day? Doing it in a place that looks straight out of a postcard. Enter the Archway Islands, a group of four rock stacks at Wharariki Beach, as seen in today's image. Rising from the waters of the Tasman Sea, these rugged islets became well known around the world after they were featured in a Windows 10 desktop screensaver in 2015. At low tide, curious wanderers can explore caves and rock pools and often spot lounging seals.

> Being the 'black sheep' isn't always a bad thing—just ask the Scottish Blackface, seen here in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. With its striking dark features and a knack for thriving in places where others wouldn't, this British breed has turned the idiom on its head. Far from an outcast, it's the backbone of Scotland's rural life and a true champion of the hills and moors. Interestingly, the Blackface sheep didn't originate in Scotland but south of the Anglo-Scottish border.
> 
> The breed's history is fascinating, and varieties such as the large-framed Perth and the medium-framed Lanark types are found throughout the United Kingdom. Not only is it the most common breed in the UK, but the Blackface sheep has spread across the world, including to the US. Its coarse fleece is perfect for making durable products like carpets and tweeds—it's definitely not your average sweater material.

This is Cầu Vàng, or the Golden Bridge, a pedestrian bridge in the misty mountains near Da Nang in central Vietnam. Opened in 2018, the bridge quickly became a global sensation, captivating travelers with its unique design and awe-inspiring setting.

Made from reinforced concrete and framed by hands crafted from steel mesh and fiberglass, the bridge creates an image of timeless strength amid modern ingenuity. Suspended around 3,200 feet above sea level, the walkway offers visitors a panoramic view of the verdant countryside. A symbol of Vietnam's creativity and natural beauty, the Golden Bridge invites you to experience a stroll like no other.

> Part engineering genius, part daredevil stunt—that's the Ribblehead Viaduct in North Yorkshire, England. This Victorian structure, also known as Batty Moss Viaduct, has been carrying trains and turning heads since the 1870s. Built by the Midland Railway, it's the longest and third tallest on the Settle–Carlisle railway line. Stretching 440 yards across the Ribble Valley, its 24 stone arches reach a height of 104 feet.
> 
> Construction of the viaduct employed more than 2,000 men who lived in nearby shantytowns; tragically, more than 100 workers lost their lives during the project. In the 1980s, British Rail proposed shutting down the line, but public outcry saved it from closure. Today, the Ribblehead Viaduct remains a symbol of resilience and a marvel of historical significance, attracting visitors from around the world.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
