> We're standing on the Boundary Trail at Johnston Ridge in the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument. This view of the volcano shows how the eruption of Mount St. Helens on May 18, 1980, ripped apart the once-conical summit, forever changing the Washington landscape. Forty years ago today, 110,000 acres within Gifford Pinchot National Forest were set aside to memorialize the deadliest and most destructive volcanic eruption in the United States.
> 
> President Ronald Reagan established the monument to preserve the area for research, recreation, and education. Left to recover naturally from the eruption, the land has been open to recreational users since 1986. Though scientists believe that Mount St. Helens will erupt again sometime in the next few centuries, hikers and climbers are undeterred.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Of the many ways people have invented to ride boards of one kind or another, the sport of kiteboarding (aka kitesurfing) is one of the newest. It owes a debt to all the board sports that came before it, borrowing a little bit from snowboarding, water skiing, wakeboarding, and of course windsurfing. Like snowboarders and skiers, windsurfers and kiteboarders often share play space, as they are doing here off the Pelješac Peninsula in Croatia. They can count on a stiff afternoon breeze to fill their sails in the summer months, when the land heats up and draws in the cool air over the Adriatic.
> 
> People began experimenting with kiteboarding in the late 1970s, and with key technical innovations in the '90s, the sport began gaining popularity. Many windsurfers were drawn to kiteboarding because the detached sail—in this case the kite—gave the kiteboarders more freedom to maneuver. The kite is inflated, giving it structure and the ability to float should it land on the water. In a sign that the relatively new sport has entered the mainstream, kiteboarding will make its Summer Olympic debut at the Paris 2024 Games as one of 10 sailing events.

> While most of us play in our vast system of 63 national parks, others work there. Today, on National Park Service Founders Day, we recognize their efforts and the priceless gift of our country's national parks. The NPS protects and maintains these parks as well as hundreds of national monuments and other natural, historical, and recreational properties. They include some of our most stunning natural landscapes, like North Cascades National Park in Washington state, featured here. This image, of the Triplets and Cascade Peak, is taken from atop Forbidden Peak.
> 
> The NPS was created on August 25, 1916, when President Woodrow Wilson passed the Organic Act. At the time there were nine national parks and 33 federally protected areas such as national monuments. Today there are more than 400 such areas, managed by 22,000 NPS employees and 340,000 volunteers. The oldest national park is Yellowstone, created in 1872, believed to be the first national park in the world. The youngest is New River Gorge in West Virginia, created in 2020. Fourteen national parks have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and 21 named UNESCO Biosphere Reserves. Thirty of our 50 states have national parks, with California having the most with nine. Alaska has eight, Utah five, and Colorado four. Alaska has the four largest national parks. Not surprisingly, the vast majority of our national parks are west of the Rockies.
> 
> North Cascades is one of three national parks in Washington state (the others are Olympic and Mount Rainier). North Cascades is also the state's newest national park, created in 1968. It is perhaps the most rugged park in the lower 48 states, containing more than 500,000 acres of steep mountain peaks and vast forests, as well as the headwaters of many waterways. It boasts the most expansive system of glaciers in the US outside of Alaska. Most of the park is protected as wilderness so there are few roads, structures, or signs of human impact. It is relatively isolated even though it's within 100 miles (as the crow flies) from the metropolises of Seattle and Vancouver, Canada. This proximity of wilderness to human development reminds us why we created the NPS, to preserve some of the nation's most special places in their natural state.

> Ukrainian Independence Day takes on a greater meaning this year, as Russian troops occupy its eastern provinces and the invaders' shells rain down on its citizens. On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in a major escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War that began with Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. NATO and Europe have rallied to Ukraine's cause, and a war that many expected to last weeks has stretched into months, with the Western-backed Ukrainian forces thwarting Putin's ambitions and not showing any signs of relenting.
> 
> Today we demonstrate our solidarity with the people of Ukraine by featuring this image that evokes the flag of their nation—a field of golden wheat below a bright blue sky. Ukraine, together with Russia, has long been known as the 'breadbasket of Europe.' In recent years, Ukraine has been the world's fifth-largest exporter of wheat, accounting for 7% of global sales.  Grain yields are so high partly because Ukraine is home to a quarter of the world's highly fertile 'black soil,' or chernozem. Disruption of Ukraine's wheat production and distribution, and the theft of its grain by Russia, threaten to diminish the world's food supply and cripple Ukraine's vital farming sector.
> 
> A recent agreement that the UN brokered with Russia has allowed some of the grain trapped in Ukraine's silos to begin flowing out of the country once again. But it remains unclear how long this fragile deal will hold and whether it will bring relief to the world's hungry or to Ukraine's economy. We can only hope the people of the besieged nation are granted the independence they have strived for.

> Anchoring the eastern end of the French Riviera near the Italian border is Menton, the so-called Pearl of France. It's prized for its beauty and incredible weather that features an average of 316 days a year with full or partial sun. That climate enables Menton to enjoy amazing lemon yields that have given rise to the annual Fête du Citron, or Menton Lemon Festival, a 17-day extravaganza in February featuring floats and sculptures created out of lemons and oranges. More than 200,000 visitors marvel at the nearly 150 tons of fruit used in the festival.
> 
> Owing to its strategic location, Menton and its surrounding locale have been coveted by various powers for centuries. The princes of Monaco, Napoleon III, German Nazi forces, and the King of Sardinia among others have all held sway over this jewel of the Côte d'Azur. These days, Menton has something for everyone—gorgeous gardens, pastel-painted architecture, beaches, cafes, nightlife, and of course, lemons.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Forget looking up in the trees to find these guys. They are burrowing owls, which means that they live on the ground or under it. In fact, they often take advantage of the hard work of tunnelers such as prairie dogs or gophers by building their nests in the burrows they dug and abandoned. Think of burrowing owls as squatters of the avian world. You'll find these 7½- to 11-inch birds in North and South America, especially in grasslands, farming areas, or dry expanses with vegetation that is close to the ground.
> 
> Another of their behaviors is most unowl-like, too: While most owl species are nocturnal, burrowing owls prefer to be out and about during the day snagging bugs (except when they shelter from extreme midday heat). But they do hunt for small mammals at night using the tactical advantages of their superior hearing and night vision. They hunt by air and by land, swooping down from branches but also using their long legs to hop along the ground to catch critters, just to keep them on their toes.
> 
> In their downtime, burrowing owls snooze at the mouth of their burrows or in hollows in the ground, which do double duty as a dirt bath. If they're startled, the owls do a cartoonish bounce, then run to the safety of their burrows, uttering screams and clucks to scare off the intruder. They even mimic rattlesnake sounds to send their foes packing. These quirky birds also reject the traditional owl 'woo-who' in favor of 'coo-coooo' and the nighttime 'co-hoo.' Talk about owls of a different feather…

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> This solemn beacon set atop a rocky outcropping is in a country usually associated with sand and sun, making this a side of Spain many do not often see. We're looking out at the sea on the Costa da Morte, or Coast of Death, a nasty name for an equally nasty (but beautiful!) stretch of Galician coastline in the extreme northwest of Spain. We're featuring Costa da Morte during International Lighthouse Weekend because mariners are never happier to see a lighthouse than when they're sailing this coast, known as the Bermuda Triangle of the Eastern Atlantic.
> 
> The Costa da Morte is known for its lighthouses, like this one, called Faro de Playa Lago, one of many strung along 125 miles of coast from Finisterre in the south to Malpica in the north.  As a devourer of ships, the Costa da Morte is prolific. Since the 14th century, more than 600 shipwrecks costing thousands of lives have been documented. The rocky Costa da Morte faces the open North Atlantic and takes the brunt of big ocean swells. Deep waters turn to shallow waters quickly near this rocky cliff-strewn coast, known for its strong currents and hidden rocks. The fog can roll in quickly. Storms form frequently. And hurricane-force winds are not uncommon.
> 
> Cool, rainy, and rocky, the Galicia region of Spain is more 'Lord of the Rings' than Club Med. To visit the lighthouses of Costa da Morte, you can walk a trail appropriately called Camino dos Faros (Road of the Lighthouses). While satellite technology and electronic instruments have vastly changed how safely we can now navigate the seas, lighthouses are still vital to boating and the maritime industry. Plus, they're just darn good-looking.

> 
> Solar Impulse 2 was the second aircraft built by Swiss aviators André Borschberg and Bertrand Piccard. Borschberg is an engineer by training, Piccard a psychiatrist and balloonist who copiloted the first balloon to fly around the world nonstop. The pair took turns piloting the aircraft, which can carry only one person, on a multi-leg, 16-month flight around the world that started and ended in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.
> 
> This image was taken during the final leg from Egypt to Abu Dhabi as Solar Impulse 2 flew over the Great Pyramids of Giza. The superlight plane was powered by thousands of solar cells mounted atop its fuselage and jumbo-jet sized wings. Batteries stored energy so it could fly at night. The going was slow by the standards of modern jet travel—Solar Impulse 2 flew at an average speed of 50 mph. Clearly, solar-powered flight on a commercial scale is still many years away, but as this photo shows, its Kitty Hawk moment is in the books.
