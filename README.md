> One of the most photographed places in Japan is this otherworldly grove of towering bamboo. The Arashiyama Bamboo Grove on the outskirts of Kyoto is surrounded by temples and shrines along the Katsura River. Rising as a manicured oasis of stories-high bamboo, the grove seems to turn the world green. The former villas and temples of the old noble class are located near the Arashiyama Grove, and its single 500-yard path is usually filled with visitors wielding cameras and selfie sticks, making this serene view a rare one.
> 
> World Bamboo Day, celebrated September 18, was created in 2009 to bring attention to this useful and versatile plant that flourishes in East Asia. Though the tallest bamboo can grow up to 100 feet, bamboo is not a tree but a grass. Known for its light weight, strength, and rapid growth, bamboo can be used to make almost anything, from clothing to building materials—and its shoots can even be consumed as food. Because it grows as much as 3 feet in a day, it's a highly renewable resource. For the same reason, it's also an invasive species in some places, as a small stand of bamboo can quickly become a large one. While bamboo grows best in tropical and warm climates, it adapts well to cool temperatures and high altitudes. And though it might have the most cultural value in Asia, it grows wild in Africa, the Americas, and Australia, too. Could there be bamboo growing near you?

> Oom-pah, oom-pah… That sound can mean only one thing (at least that isn't chocolate factory-related). It's Oktoberfest season! Don't start the party too fast, though: You might want to ride the Wellenflug swing carousel seen in today's photo before you get too much of that distinctly German beer in your belly. And it is distinct: Due to strict Reinheitsgebot ('purity orders') regulations in place since 1516, real German beer can only be made with certain ingredients—originally just barley, hops, and water, though other additions have trickled in over time.
> 
> From today until October 3, brass bands will play traditional German folk music as festive crowds eat, drink, and generally be merry in Munich, Germany—and most everywhere, thanks to the many copycat fests now held around the world. But let's face it, the Germans have most of us beat for beer consumption, as each Munich Oktoberfest sees nearly 2 million gallons of the stuff quaffed by visitors.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Odds are this very focused puma has its eyes locked on a guanaco, a relative of the llama that's firmly at the top of its daily menu. In this case, dinner will be served in Torres del Paine National Park in the Patagonia region of Chile, the sprawling park recognized as one of the most famous places in the world to watch and photograph wild pumas. While tourists will sometimes see the big cats on their own, trained guides take visitors on hikes or all-terrain vehicle tours to look for the stealthy pumas. The wild cats have been officially protected for the last few years, bolstering their population, and there are abundant guanacos in the Patagonian steppes, which also helps.
> 
> The puma (which is the same big cat you might call a mountain lion or cougar) is the fourth-largest cat in the world, following the lion, tiger, and jaguar. Pumas don't roar like their large cousins—instead, they purr like house cats. That might explain why people in Patagonia simply call pumas gatos ('cats' in Spanish). With their characteristic slim build and impressive camouflage coloring, these canny hunters can live 10 years in their remote Patagonian home.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> We're kicking off Hispanic Heritage Month with this beautiful mural celebrating the contributions made to the Buffalo, New York, region by the Hispanic and Latinx communities. Artist, community activist, and educator Betsy Casañas, with the assistance of many local artists, created this mural called 'Homeland, Perhaps It Is Because I Wish to See You Fly, That My Flight Continues to Be Yours.' Its subjects highlight local cultural heritage, including portrayals of agricultural production and industrial work. Through conversations with members of the community, Casañas incorporated symbolism inspired by the mixed and integrated Latinx community of Buffalo.
> 
> Hispanic Heritage Month, a celebration of Hispanic and Latinx contributions to the United States, takes place each year from September 15 to October 15. Why doesn't it start at the beginning of the month? Because September 15 and 16 are important dates for many Hispanic communities in the Americas. On September 15, 1821, five Central American nations (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua) declared their independence from Spain, almost 11 years to the day (September 16, 1810) after Mexico had declared its independence. These countries were specifically mentioned when US President Lyndon Johnson proclaimed the enactment of what was then Hispanic Heritage Week. In the 1980s, the week became a month, and Belize (which had declared independence from the UK on September 21, 1981) was added to the list of celebrated nations.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> In the late 1800s, pioneers in Utah who wanted to expand their settlements south into Arizona were confronted by 600 miles of deep canyons carved by the Colorado River. By 1873 a ferry was established to cross the Colorado at the mouth of Glen Canyon—Lees Ferry, as it was called, remained vital to settlers in the area for more than 50 years, until authorities decided a bridge would provide more reliable and safer crossing. Construction began in 1927 of a span across the 834-foot gap of Marble Canyon, at the head of the Grand Canyon. When Grand Canyon Bridge opened to traffic in 1929 it was hailed as a 'modern marvel' and 'the biggest news in Southwest history.'
> 
> But as time passed, the bridge, which was officially renamed Navajo Bridge in 1934, saw heavier vehicles and more traffic. Debates raged over the traffic’s impact on Native land and endangered plants, and the likelihood of debris falling into the river below. The solution was a new, nearly identical but wider second bridge just downstream from the original bridge. It was dedicated on September 14, 1995, to much fanfare. Both bridges, collectively known as Navajo Bridge, are about 470 feet above the river below. The original span serves as a path for humans and horses while the new bridge carries vehicles.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we celebrate the birthday of Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve, which boasts 750-foot (and higher) sand dunes that cover more than 30 square miles. But the towering hills of sand—the tallest in North America—are just one feature of an eye-popping Colorado landscape that includes conifer forests, alpine lakes, and wetlands. The 150,000-acre park and preserve even encompasses stretches of tundra at the higher elevations, where it edges up against the base of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.
> 
> Initially proclaimed a national monument in 1932 by President Herbert Hoover, the territory was redesignated as Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve on September 13, 2004, and the size of the park was quadrupled. The protected landscape provides ample opportunities for visitors to enjoy a wide range of activities, from sandboarding and sand sledding down the steep dunes to hiking, camping, horseback riding, and fat-tire biking.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we're following our nose to the Pantanal in Brazil to visit this member of the toucan family named for the brownish plumage around its ears. What, you've never heard of a chestnut-eared aracari? That could be because aracaris don't really stand out among toucans at a glance: They have long, colorful bills, and they mate for life, always laying eggs in the same nest year after year. But aracaris are much more social nesters: Up to six aracari adults and all their babies might live in one nest.
> 
> Toucans are found in tropical climates in Central and South America, mainly in rainforests—our chestnut-eared friend tends to live in the southern Amazon Basin. Known frugivores, or fruit eaters, toucans have also been spotted eating the occasional lizard or even rival bird. They tend to be friendly with humans and have been successfully kept as pets—but probably prefer the wild life.

> 
> Solar Impulse 2 was the second aircraft built by Swiss aviators André Borschberg and Bertrand Piccard. Borschberg is an engineer by training, Piccard a psychiatrist and balloonist who copiloted the first balloon to fly around the world nonstop. The pair took turns piloting the aircraft, which can carry only one person, on a multi-leg, 16-month flight around the world that started and ended in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.
> 
> This image was taken during the final leg from Egypt to Abu Dhabi as Solar Impulse 2 flew over the Great Pyramids of Giza. The superlight plane was powered by thousands of solar cells mounted atop its fuselage and jumbo-jet sized wings. Batteries stored energy so it could fly at night. The going was slow by the standards of modern jet travel—Solar Impulse 2 flew at an average speed of 50 mph. Clearly, solar-powered flight on a commercial scale is still many years away, but as this photo shows, its Kitty Hawk moment is in the books.
