> Spot the wildlife star in today's image. The jaguar is the largest cat in the Americas and is seen here in the world's largest tropical wetland, the Pantanal in Brazil. Jaguars arrived in the Americas some 2 million years ago, migrating from Eurasia through the Bering Strait. Today, they live in various habitats from the woodlands of the southwestern US to the rainforests of northern Argentina. Brazil is home to about half of the world's wild jaguars.
> 
> Often found near bodies of water, jaguars are excellent swimmers, ambushing prey by leaping into the water. They feed on a wide range of animals, including deer, armadillos, monkeys, and lizards and their strong teeth and jaws can bite through turtle shells. In the Brazilian Pantanal, a population of jaguars feeds on aquatic reptiles and fish. So, the next time you are on a jungle trail, keep your eyes peeled and your senses sharp: Every rustle of leaves could be a jaguar on the prowl.

> Blooming pillar corals, green sea turtles, and colorful reef fishes—welcome to the underwater universe of coral reefs. They are formed by tiny marine organisms called coral polyps, which create vast colonies housing many species. As we celebrate their beauty and benefits, it's vital to recognize the lurking threats of climate change, pollution, and harmful human activities.
> 
> This underwater scene was photographed at Mayotte, a French island region in the Indian Ocean. Mayotte boasts one of the world's largest and deepest lagoons, encircled by a coral reef nearly 100 miles long. It is home to over 250 species of coral and more than 3,500 marine species. But it is facing numerous threats, including overfishing and coral bleaching, where corals expel the algae that live in their tissues, leading to a loss of color and essential energy sources. So, in Coral Reef Awareness Week, let's pledge to preserve coral reefs like this one.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to Rothenburg ob der Tauber, or 'Red Fortress above the Tauber River,' where medieval charm is around every cobbled corner. A self-ruling city in the Middle Ages, this walled Bavarian town once flourished with 6,000 inhabitants, the Holy Roman Empire's second-largest city at the time. The growth of Rothenburg ob der Tauber slowed in the 17th century, preserving its original character.
> 
> Pictured here is the Burgtor (castle gate), which was built after the original Rothenburg Castle was destroyed by an earthquake in 1356. Within the castle gate is an 'eye-of-the-needle' door, designed to be the only way in and out once the main gates closed at night. But Rothenburg's magic isn't confined to its walls. It's also a gateway to the 290-mile Romantic Road that runs from Würzburg to Füssen, covering Bavaria's castle-studded valleys.

> Archaeology might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of festivals, but the Festival of British Archaeology, July 13-28, is here to change that. Since its inception in 1990, it has evolved into a two-week event. A clever shift from September to July has made it easier for archaeological buffs to explore summer digs and heritage wonders. This year's theme of 'Archaeology and Community' invites enthusiasts across the United Kingdom for an array of in-person and virtual events. Imagine standing amid Skara Brae's ancient stone houses on Scotland's Orkney archipelago, pictured here, where Neolithic settlers thrived over 5,000 years ago. Exposed by an 1850 storm, this prehistoric marvel is dubbed the 'Scottish Pompeii' due to its astonishing preservation—older than Stonehenge and even the Great Pyramids. So, grab your trowel, and get ready to dig deep into the incredible, storied past. Who knows what you'll discover!

> Today, we're floating across the waves, following the ocean currents to Japan. Marine Day—海の日, Umi no Hi in Japanese—is celebrated on the third Monday in July. Japan has 14,125 islands and has over 18,400 miles of coastline, so it's no wonder the sea plays such a key role in its culture. It provides much of the country's food and is vital for trading and communicating with other nations.
> 
> One Marine Day tradition is to give thanks by throwing mud balls into the water; these balls are packed with microorganisms that help to purify the sea. Today's image takes us to Tateishi Park on Japan's largest island, Honshu. This scenic spot has stunning views of Sagami Bay and Mount Fuji, making it the perfect place to celebrate Japan's coastal waters.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Surrounded by rugged, dark landscapes, La Geria is a marvel of viticulture. Most of the Spanish island of Lanzarote is treeless and covered with black-gray soil. This thick blanket of volcanic gravel is the result of a series of eruptions in the 1700s. By 1775, farmers started growing crops in the new layer of nutrient-rich soil. Volcanic soil absorbs and retains moisture, and the ash keeps its temperature favorable for growing grapes. The holes surrounded by stones you see in our image were dug to protect young grape plants from strong winds. La Geria's innovative approach to cultivation in an arid climate has been rewarded with its abundance of fine wine, fermented from Malvasia grapes.

> Are you ready to make some noise? Wait, not that sort of rock. Today, we're all about granite, limestone, and slate. There are three types of rock: igneous rocks formed from magma and lava; sedimentary rocks made from a mixture of particles like sand and mud; and metamorphic rocks that are the result of heat and pressure on other kinds of rock.
> 
> Today's image takes us to the 'fairy chimneys' of Cappadocia in central Türkiye. These cone-shaped pillars are made of tuff, a sedimentary rock formed from volcanic ash and debris. In the sides of the rocks, ancient residents carved homes and churches. The area is also famous for its underground cities, which were cut out of the tuff to provide shelter and safety. This is just one of the many uses for rocks that humans have come up with throughout history.
