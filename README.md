> Amid the hues of dawn, captured in today's image, two wallabies stand alert in a field near the Adelaide River in Australia's Northern Territory. These marsupials, smaller cousins of the kangaroo, are native to Australia and New Guinea. There are around 30 species of wallabies, including swamp, rock, and hare-wallabies. These sprightly mammals have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and deliver powerful kicks if threatened. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts in an attempt to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs' for safety and mutual grooming. Their playgrounds are forests that echo with the thudding of their hops as they navigate their home range.

> From today, National Hispanic Heritage Month unfurls its vibrant celebrations of Hispanic Americans' contributions to US culture and society. The date coincides with the independence days of several Latin American nations, like Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Mexico, and Chile. Established as Hispanic Heritage Week in 1968, it was expanded to a month by President Ronald Reagan in 1988.
> 
> San Diego's Balboa Park was a scrub-filled mesa when civic leaders decided to set aside 1,400 acres to create a large urban park in 1868. As seen in today's image, the Casa del Prado is one of several reconstructed buildings in this part of the park, where local festivities spring to life during National Hispanic Heritage Month. Music, dance, parades, and storytelling celebrate America's approximately 65 million Hispanics, whose culture is deeply interwoven with American history.

> Welcome to Rapa Nui, also known as Easter Island, one of the world's most remote and enchanting paradises, roughly 2,330 miles west of mainland Chile. Famous for its iconic moai statues, Rapa Nui boasts breathtaking landscapes and rich cultural heritage. Experts are divided on when the island's ancestral inhabitants first arrived from Polynesia, though many researchers suggest it was around the 8th century. Take in the mesmerizing sunrise featured in today's image and explore the striking volcanic craters and lush, grassy plains where the imposing statues stand. The World Heritage property of Easter Island spans more than 17,000 acres, including four nearby islets.
> 
> The island's original inhabitants call it Rapa Nui, meaning 'Great Rapa,' referring to the land's similarity to Rapa Island, in French Polynesia. Dutch explorer Jacob Roggeveen, the first European to visit, named it Paasch-Eyland, or 'Easter Island' in English, to mark his arrival on Easter Sunday. You can explore this unique World Heritage site year-round. Dive into its vibrant history and let the island's charm sweep you away.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This stunning 71,028-acre coastal haven on the Point Reyes Peninsula in Marin County is a gem of the California coastline. Filled with scenic trails that wind through forests and along cliffs, it boasts breathtaking views and lots of wildlife. Point Reyes National Seashore also has a reputation as the most wind-swept spot on the Pacific Coast and the second-foggiest area in North America, so dress accordingly.
> 
> The lighthouse was built in 1870 due to frequent shipwrecks in treacherous coastal waters. This iconic landmark served as a crucial navigation aid for more than 100 years before being replaced by an automated light in 1975. Today, the lighthouse remains a key element of Point Reyes' charm and continues to be a favorite attraction. Whether you're spotting elephant seals, hiking to the picturesque Point Reyes Lighthouse, or simply soaking in the serene beauty of the rolling waves, there's something for everyone.

> Grab your flippers—it's World Dolphin Day, a day to celebrate and promote the conservation of these aquatic mammals. Dolphins are highly intelligent and can be found all over the world in oceans, rivers, and estuaries. But they are threatened by human activities, such as hunting, pollution, and fishing. Hunting in particular led to the creation of World Dolphin Day in 2022 by Sea Shepherd Global, an international marine conservation group.
> 
> The pod of dolphins seen in today's image was photographed near Réunion, an island in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Madagascar. Marine wildlife found year-round in Réunion's deeper waters include many types of sharks, orcas, humpback whales, sea turtles, and dolphins. The island's warm, tropical climate is ideal for these creatures, as well as spinner, bottlenose, and rough-toothed dolphins, which also swim in the island's crystal-clear waters.

> On Patriot Day, we are at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York City, where the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center once stood. The museum is 70 feet underground, beneath the memorial's waterfall pools in the footprints of the fallen towers. The names of those who died in the 2001 terrorist attacks and in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing are listed on bronze parapets surrounding these huge reflecting pools. Seven stories below the memorial, the museum tells the story of 9/11 through exhibits, artifacts, historical records, and personal accounts, remembering the victims and those who risked their lives to save others.
> 
> Patriot Day honors the 2,977 people killed in the September 11 attacks on the United States. In 2001, Congress passed the Patriot Day resolution, which calls for US flags to fly at half-staff and for a moment of silence at 8:46 AM EST.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This sleek structure is the Vasco da Gama Bridge, which appears to vanish into the horizon after crossing the Tagus River in Portugal. Stretching nearly 8 miles, it was Europe's longest bridge when it opened in 1998, built to ease traffic on Lisbon's 25 de Abril Bridge and make travel smoother between the north and south of Portugal. This cable-stayed bridge was designed to be earthquake and wind-resistant; its deck is not fixed to the pylons, and it can move both lengthwise and sideways. Its opening was perfectly timed for Expo 98, the World's Fair celebrating the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's historic sea route discovery from Europe to India.

Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
