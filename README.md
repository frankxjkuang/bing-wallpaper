<summary>Description</summary>

> May 1915: Chicago buzzes with energy. Streetcars pass brick buildings, shop signs catch the morning light, and the city moves with purpose. But today, something different takes over the streets. The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, just months old, march in rows as sharp as the suits they craft. This isn't a quiet debut—it's a statement.
> 
> Formed by tailors and factory workers who broke away from more cautious unions, the Amalgamated brought together recent immigrants, skilled hands, and people tired of 14-hour shifts. In this parade, they're not behind machines—they're out front, holding banners high and showing what collective strength looks like.
> 
> Labor Day became a national holiday in 1894, but by 1915, it was still evolving—part celebration, part protest. Originally created to honor workers' contributions amid demands for fair wages, safer conditions, and shorter workdays, today, it's marked by barbecues, marches, sales, and one last summer break. It's a pause in the calendar that reminds us why time off matters—and a nod to those who keep the country moving.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Long before GPS, natural landmarks like Scotts Bluff rose high above the prairie, signaling to travelers that they were on the right path heading west. Before Gering became a town in 1887 and decades before Nebraska achieved statehood in 1867, these sandstone and siltstone formations were already guiding thousands along the Oregon, California, and Mormon Trails. Scotts Bluff National Monument is named after Hiram Scott, a fur trader with the Rocky Mountain Fur Company who died under mysterious circumstances nearby in the 1820s.
> 
> Today, the nearly 3,000-acre monument includes two main bluffs—Scotts Bluff to the north and South Bluff. It also protects five prominent outcroppings: Dome Rock, Eagle Rock, Crown Rock, Saddle Rock, and Sentinel Rock. At ground level, mule deer graze alongside black-tailed prairie dogs, while coyotes prowl and short grasses ripple in the wind. Higher up, the landscape shifts, spiny yuccas and hardy shrubs cling to rocky slopes, and bighorn sheep navigate the cliffs with ease. Though the wagons are long gone, Scotts Bluff still stands as a guide through both history and terrain.

> If you've never seen a nearly 40-foot, polka-dotted fish gliding past coral reefs, you are missing out. Today is International Whale Shark Day, a reminder that these slow-motion giants need our attention. First observed in 2008, the day is used by researchers and marine advocates to spotlight conservation efforts and threats like vessel strikes, plastic pollution, and unregulated tourism.
> 
> Whale sharks are the biggest fish in the sea, but don't let the word 'shark' fool you. They're plankton-eating giants with no interest in humans. Found in warm waters from the Maldives and Mozambique to Mexico's Yucatán coast, they often show up in food-rich, calm waters. Their mouths can stretch over four feet wide, but they feed by suction, not biting. Each has a unique pattern of white spots and stripes—no two alike—used by researchers to track individuals. Their breeding patterns remain largely a mystery, but they are ovoviviparous, meaning pups hatch inside the mother before being born alive. On a day like today, their story reminds us how much ocean life remains a mystery and how vital it is to protect what we already know is at risk.

> Seen from above, the uniform arcades and tiled rooftops of Plaza Mayor in Madrid—the capital of Spain—create a captivating architectural harmony. Once the site of a bustling market square known as the Plaza del Arrabal, this historic space has witnessed the city's transformation over the centuries. The shift began in 1561, when the plaza came under Madrid's jurisdiction after the royal court moved from Toledo. Inspired by a vision of order and grandeur, King Philip II reimagined the square—though construction did not actually begin until 1617, under the reign of Philip III.
> 
> Featuring a rectangular layout, the plaza is framed by three-story buildings with 237 inward-facing balconies. It has 10 entrances, nine of which are gated. At its center stands the equestrian statue of Philip III, added in 1848. Over the years, the square has hosted everything from local festivities and bullfights to beatifications and royal ceremonies. Today, it remains a vibrant gathering place, featuring Easter drum parades, outdoor concerts, an annual Christmas market, and a Sunday morning market for stamp and coin collectors.

<summary>Description</summary>

> They wear white after Labor Day—and all year long—with zero shame. Meet the great egret, also known as the great white egret. Found in the Americas, Asia, Africa, and parts of Europe, these birds are often seen wading through wetlands, tidal flats, and quiet streams. Patient and precise, they stand motionless for minutes, waiting for just the right moment to deliver a lightning-fast strike. Fish are their main prey, but they also eat frogs, reptiles, and even small mammals.
> 
> In the late 1800s, the great egret's beautiful plumes became a must-have in women's fashion across North America, driving their population down by an estimated 95%. The killing might have continued if not for two Boston socialites, Harriet Hemenway and Minna Hall, who led a boycott of the feather trade. Their activism helped launch the National Audubon Society. It also pushed Congress to pass the Weeks–McLean Law in 1913, which banned market hunting and protected migratory birds. Today, the great egret is a powerful conservation success story thanks to more than a century of legal protection and public action. It also serves as the Audubon Society's symbol.

> Nature has its tricks, and Sørvágsvatn is one of its best. World Lake Day is the perfect occasion to explore this optical illusion in the Faroe Islands, an autonomous administrative division of the Kingdom of Denmark. Also called Leitisvatn, this lake on the island of Vágar appears to float far above the ocean. In reality, it sits less than 100 feet above sea level. As the largest lake in the Faroes, Sørvágsvatn has a surface area of about 1.3 square miles and feeds the Bøsdalafossur waterfall, where its waters pour dramatically into the sea.
> 
> As we mark World Lake Day, Sørvágsvatn reminds us why lakes are so vital. They not only provide recreation but also store freshwater, regulate local climates, and support biodiversity. Yet today, many are under threat. Pollution, overuse, climate change, and fluctuating water levels are placing increasing pressure on these fragile ecosystems. So, the next time you look at a map, think of lakes not just as dots of blue but as living, breathing parts of our world that deserve our care and attention.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> If fairy tales had architects, they might've come up with something like Alberobello in Italy. But instead of magic wands, it was limestone, mortar-free masonry, and—according to some theories—a bit of tax evasion that built this town's signature homes: the trulli. These are whitewashed stone houses topped with dry-stacked limestone roofs shaped like upside-down ice cream cones. It's an ancient building technique, and in this case, a clever one. Back in the 14th century, locals were reportedly trying to avoid property taxes by constructing homes that could be quickly dismantled when the king's tax collector came around.
> 
> Alberobello's trulli aren't hidden one-offs. Entire districts—like Rione Monti and Aia Piccola—are packed with these quirky structures. Some are still lived in, while others have been transformed into cafés, souvenir shops, and pint-sized museums. You'll even find a church built in trullo style. In 1996, UNESCO gave the trulli of Alberobello the heritage stamp of approval. It's not every day that a loophole becomes a landmark.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
