> The sea is a tough workplace, and a busy one—the shipping industry is the backbone of the global economy, transporting more than 80% of the world’s trade. On World Maritime Day, shipping professionals and leaders gather to raise awareness about maritime safety, sustainable shipping practices, and pollution. Organized by the International Maritime Organization, a UN agency, the day also honors maritime workers. These unsung heroes work long hours and spend months away from family to keep our trade flowing.
> 
> This year's theme focuses on the 50th anniversary of MARPOL 73/78, an international law that regulates emissions and aims to minimize pollution in our ocean waters. While the ocean plays a vital global role in trade, the survival of many species on Earth, including our own, depends on it remaining a healthy place.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Via Krupp is a cliffside pathway on the Italian island of Capri, renowned for its dramatic serpentine design. Built between 1900 and 1902 by the German industrialist Friedrich Alfred Krupp, the footpath connects the town of Capri to Marina Piccola beach, and  allowed Krupp to access his properties. The pathway's intricate layout, with its sharp turns and steep inclines, was an engineering marvel of its time. Via Krupp's panoramic vistas of the Tyrrhenian Sea, the Faraglioni rock formations, and the lush landscape of the island have drawn admiration for generations. Due to concerns over preservation and safety, because of falling rocks, the pathway has faced intermittent closures, though it reopened in June this year for the first time in nine years.

> Welcome to the concrete waves of Venice Beach, California, a skateboarder's paradise. Built next to the beach town's sun-kissed shores, Venice Skatepark stands as a testament to the history of skateboarding in the state.
> 
> Opened in 2009, the park was the result of years of efforts by residents, spearheaded by Venice skating legend Jesse Martinez. With a plethora of challenging ramps, bowls, and rails, it has something to keep skaters of all skill levels entertained. Its oceanfront setting also makes it a popular spot for spectators to stop by and watch gravity-defying tricks from backside tailslides and 360 pop shove-its, to skaters dropping into a bowl to nail an eggplant. And if you're not sure what any of those things are, there's also a great view of the beach.

<summary>Description</summary>

> It's hard not to smile when you spot a sea otter. Their whiskery faces, busy paws, and thick fur give the impression of a stuffed animal that has come to life and taken to the ocean. The heaviest members of the weasel family, sea otters aren't just cute. They also play a vital role in the underwater kelp forest ecosystem, keeping the destructive sea urchin population in check—by eating them.
> 
> Sea Otter Awareness Week aims to help protect their populations, found along the coasts of the north Pacific Ocean. They once numbered 300,000 but they dropped to fewer than 2,000 after widespread hunting. International protections were put into place in 1911 and numbers have rebounded to around 125,000, but they remain endangered. While some habitats never recovered, others have emerged in entirely new locations, such as Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve in Alaska. In 1995, five sea otters were spotted in Glacier Bay. Today, there are more than 8,000 hunting, playing, and raising pups in the kelp-abundant waters.

> If you are a nature enthusiast, or simply enjoy listening to the sound of rumbling rivers, you might like to know that today is World Rivers Day. First held in 2005 during the United Nations' 'Water for Life’ campaign, it was proposed by Canadian river conservationist Mark Angelo, who founded BC Rivers Day in western Canada in 1980. World Rivers Day is held on the fourth Sunday of September to celebrate and raise awareness of the benefits that rivers provide to people and the planet.
> 
> The star of today's image, the Fraser River, is the longest river in British Columbia and the 11th longest in Canada. The stream meanders from the Rocky Mountains, traveling more than 850 miles over slopes and flatlands before it merges with the Strait of Georgia, just south of Vancouver.

> Autumn has officially begun! In the Northern Hemisphere, the autumnal equinox falls on September 23 this year, marking the beginning of autumn. Today is one of the two moments in the year when day and night are equal in length, thanks to the sun's location exactly above the equator. In the Southern Hemisphere, today marks the vernal equinox and they are heading into spring.

> Keep the five alive! That is the mission of World Rhinoceros Day, rhino specialists, and fans around the globe. Those five species are: the Javan, Sumatran, greater one-horned, black, and white rhinoceros. It is the white rhino which can be seen on our homepage, identified by its two horns and square lip.
> 
> The wild rhino population globally is estimated to be under 27,000—less than the average capacity at a Major League Baseball stadium. While there have been conservation successes, ensuring these amazing animals survive is a continuing challenge. Habitat loss is one threat, but rhinos are particularly targeted by poachers for their horns. Parks like the Shamwari Game Reserve in South Africa, pictured above, employ anti-poaching squads to keep these rhinos safe.
