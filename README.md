> Wave our national symbol today; it's Flag Day! On June 14, 1777, by resolution of the Second Continental Congress, the nation's first official flag was approved. Throughout US history, the flag's design has changed. In its current arrangement, the 13 stripes represent the original colonies, and the stars stand for the states. The flag was last modified in 1960 when Hawaii became a state, and the number of white stars on a blue background increased from 49 to 50.
> 
> Some states have always celebrated the adoption of the Stars and Stripes with parades or by displaying the national flag in their homes; however, the official observance of Flag Day dates back to 1949, thanks to legislation passed by President Harry Truman. On the 75th anniversary of the national commemoration, we wish our flag to fly high!

> Gather 'round, explorers, as we tiptoe into the Registan Square in the city of Samarkand, Uzbekistan! Meaning 'sandy place' or 'desert' in Persian, Registan was the center of activity during the Timurid Empire. The square embodied the essence of the Timurid Renaissance, a period of cultural and intellectual revival, which spread throughout the Muslim world between the 14th and early 16th centuries CE.
> 
> In this grand square, citizens came together to hear royal proclamations, announced with resounding blasts from colossal copper pipes known as dzharchis. The Registan Square is encircled by three Islamic schools, namely the Ulugh Beg Madrasah, the Sher-Dor Madrasah, and the Tilya-Kori Madrasah, characterized by the Islamic architectural style, which typically features elaborate repetitive patterns and ornamental forms. The influence of Registan's magnificence is seen everywhere, from the Safavid monuments of Persia to the Mughal buildings of India and Pakistan. The square's architectural impact can also be seen in far-off places, like the early 20th-century Saint Petersburg Mosque in Russia.

> Ready to channel your inner nature enthusiast? Let's explore Big Bend National Park in West Texas, which is celebrating its 80th birthday today. This park is the largest protected area in the Chihuahuan Desert, covering over 1,250 square miles. The Big Bend State Park was established on June 12, 1944, when the state of Texas transferred this land to the federal government.
> 
> Within the park lie not only historic landmarks like the Castolon Historic District and the Hot Springs Historic District, but also the footprints of modern pioneers, ranchers, and miners. This land is also one of North America's premier destinations for stargazing. The absence of human activity in the surrounding regions results in low-level light pollution and some of the darkest night skies in the area. Bring your binoculars along and enjoy an evening full of Milky Way vistas, meteor showers, star sightings, and taking pictures of the stunning night sky.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Horns up, heads high! Featured here is a group of gemsboks, a large antelope, reigning over the sprawling savannas in southwestern Africa. Indigenous to the arid territories of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and parts of Zimbabwe, they thrive mainly within the Kalahari and Namib Deserts. They can survive in extremely dry conditions and can go without water for weeks, getting moisture from the food they eat. Moreover, gemsboks are adept runners, achieving speeds of up to 37 miles per hour. Their distinguishing trait is their notably elongated, straight horns. Although both genders possess these formidable defenses, the females' horns tend to be slightly longer and sleeker while the males' horns are thicker with broader bases. So, if you ever find yourself in the sandy plains of the Kalahari, keep an eye out for these desert gems.

Traditionally an economic hub, Osaka has twice served briefly as the imperial capital, once in the 7th and once in the 8th century. It flourished culturally during the Edo period (1603–1867) and became a major industrial center after the Meiji Restoration in1868, which restored imperial rule to Japan.
> 
> Known as the 'Nation's Kitchen,' Osaka boasts a culinary scene that tantalizes taste buds with dishes like takoyaki, a ball-shaped fried cake stuffed with chopped octopus, and okonomiyaki, a savory pancake loaded with cabbage, meat, and various toppings. But the city's charm isn't just in its gastronomic delights. Step into the past's embrace at Osaka Castle, a majestic relic of Japan's rich history and a symbol of unwavering resilience. Wander through the gardens of Shitenno-ji Temple, one of the oldest Buddhist temples in the country and an oasis of tranquility amidst the bustling city. Explore Dōtonbori, a district known for its dazzling neon billboards, including the famous Glico Running Man and the towering mechanized crab sign of Kani Dōraku restaurant. Every corner of Osaka is a journey through time and flavors.

> The lush greenery of June is here, and so is National Rivers Month, a 30-day tribute to the veins of our planet that was created by Canadian activist Mark Angelo. Just like the confluence featured here today, where Alaska's Easter Creek and Killik River unite in a beautiful display, we too come together every year to help preserve the nation's rivers. With increasing threats such as pollution, habitat destruction, and overuse, it's more important than ever to advocate for the protection of our waterways. Whether you're paddling down a gentle stream, casting a line for some fishing fun, or simply enjoying a leisurely stroll along the riverbank, there are countless ways to connect with these flowing wonders. The US alone boasts a vast network of over 250,000 rivers that stretches more than 3 million miles across diverse terrains. Which one are you heading to?

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
