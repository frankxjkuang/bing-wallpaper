> We're celebrating Penguin Awareness Day in the Falkland Islands, taking a stroll with some king penguins. Kings are the second-largest penguin species, only outranked in stature by their emperor penguin cousins. And while the kings' tuxedo coloring gives them a dash of the debonair, it also provides an important and more practical purpose: camouflage. When the birds dive deep into the ocean looking for food, their black feathers disguise the birds from predators above, while their white undersides do the reverse. Kings are legendary for their diving prowess—in their quest for tasty squid and lanternfish, they can dive to depths of 300 feet, and some have even been spotted nearly 1,000 feet beneath the surface. Underwater, these flightless birds are the epitome of grace. On land, however, they are not so graceful, and waddle or 'toboggan' on their bellies to get around.

<summary>Description</summary>

> As beautiful as this vista is, most of today's visitors to Park City are there to spend the day inside. Sundance Film Festival, the nation's biggest celebration of independent cinema, opens today and runs through January 29. The careers of Hollywood directors such as Quentin Tarantino and Steven Soderbergh were launched here, and every year a new crop of greenhorns arrives in this mountain enclave with the dream that they'll leave with a distribution deal.
> 
> It's a common misconception that the festival was founded by Robert Redford. It was actually started as the Utah Film Festival in Salt Lake City in 1978 by Sterling Van Wagenen, who then brought on Redford as chairman. Redford has remained involved with the festival ever since, presiding over its move to Park City and transformation into the largest festival of its kind in the United States. In the past decade, Sundance London and Sundance Hong Kong have expanded the mission of the Sundance Institute.

> If today's photo evokes some chilly feelings inside of you, surprise! That's not snow, but part of the largest gypsum dune field on the planet. We're at White Sands National Park in New Mexico, which was first established as a monument on this date in 1933 and then became a national park in 2019. Roughly 4.5 billion tons of gypsum sand has massed in the Tularosa Basin over the past 12,000 years, having worn off the surrounding mountains. Thousands of species live in the park, many of which have evolved to have white coloration, allowing them to blend into the environment.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The Muniellos Nature Reserve is one of Spain's best-preserved forests of Quercus robur, otherwise known as common oak, European oak, or English oak. The 13,560-acre reserve in Asturias province also includes sessile oaks, seen in our photo alongside beech trees.
> 
> In the 1970s logging was banned in the reserve. Soon after, hunting was also banned. Today, even human access to this UNESCO-designated biosphere is carefully controlled. There's a visitor center, and that's about as far as most tourists are allowed. We're just glad we have photos of this incredible forest.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> This striking memorial to Civil Rights icon Martin Luther King, Jr., displays 14 powerful quotes from his speeches and writings. The Inscription Wall, in Washington DC, lets the visitor browse the quotes without the structure of a timeline—the earliest quote dates to 1956 and the Montgomery Bus Boycott; the most recent is taken from Dr. King's sermon at the National Cathedral in Washington just four days before he was assassinated.
> 
> While the quotations float freely in time, there is a clear overarching theme. The National Park Service explains that the inscriptions 'stress four primary messages of Dr. King: justice, democracy, hope, and love.'
> 
> Perhaps surprisingly, there are no quotes from Dr. King's famous 'I Have a Dream' speech. That's not an oversight, though: The whole memorial has that legendary speech as its theme.

Despite this, it was badly damaged in the Great Fire of Turku, which consumed much of the city in 1827. The cathedral was rebuilt over the next few years.

> This fuzzy donkey feeding on the leaves of a cherry tree probably doesn't know that today was once celebrated as the Feast of the Donkey. We think any day is a good day to celebrate donkeys. They've carried the load for humans for more than 7,000 years, so let's give them some love. More than 40 million donkeys do the heavy lifting around the world today, with 11 million in China alone.
> 
> Medieval Christians celebrated January 14 as the Feast of the Donkey, or Feast of the Ass—acknowledging the importance of donkeys in the Bible. The passage of Mary, Joseph, and their newborn son into Egypt was usually depicted with Mary and her child riding on a donkey. The festival fell out of favor by the 15th century.
