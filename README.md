> Today is about honoring the tallest creatures on Earth and highlighting the importance of conservation efforts. Giraffes have fascinated travelers from around the world for a long time. These animals were once viewed as status symbols and were treasured as pets among royalty.
> 
> Featured here are reticulated giraffes, found mostly in Kenya, but also in parts of Somalia and Ethiopia. Reticulated means to resemble a network or net, and these majestic creatures are named after their coats, which feature large spots that extend onto the lower legs, tail, and face. Only around 16,000 reticulated giraffes remain in the wild, less than half of those recorded in the 1980s. Nevertheless, in recent years there has been a promising trend in northern Kenya, where populations are rebounding thanks to places like the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy. So, let's pledge to protect these creatures and their habitats.

<summary>Description</summary>

> It's that time of year again when the daylight stretches long into the evening hours. Today is the longest day of the year, known as the summer solstice, which happens when one of the Earth's poles is most inclined toward the sun. Today's image features the Kokino megalithic observatory, part of a wider archaeological site in North Macedonia. It is believed that it marked the position of the sun during summer and winter solstices, as well as the equinox, and consists of two platforms. A stone block on the upper platform of the observatory indicates the summer solstice sunrise direction when seen from a seat on the lower platform. This Bronze Age astronomical wonder sits more than 3,300 feet above sea level, on a hill overlooking the hamlet of Kokino.

> Juneteenth commemorates the end of slavery in the US. On June 19, 1865, Union troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, to enforce the Emancipation Proclamation issued by Abraham Lincoln. Juneteenth became a federal holiday in 2021, an acknowledgment of its indelible imprint on the country.
> 
> Today, we're featuring the New York mosaic 'Community,' by African American artist Jacob Lawrence. Lawrence was born in New Jersey to parents who, along with about 6 million African Americans, moved from the rural south to cities like New York City, Chicago, and Detroit during the Great Migration (1910-1970). He viewed the Black American experience as integral to American heritage and depicted its struggles and triumphs through vibrant, angular paintings, including his famed 'The Migration Series.' Lawrence was also inspired by the Harlem Renaissance, a revival of African American culture in the 1920s and 30s. His groundbreaking works broke racial barriers and continue to educate and inspire today.

> As spring gives way to summer in Iceland, the rugged landscape bursts into color. Lupines were introduced here in the 1940s for their soil-binding properties, to reduce erosion. The plant flourishes in sandy and salty soils and spreads rapidly, bringing hues of purple, pink, and blue. Although some consider lupine to be a threat to native plants, it is welcomed by many as a cherished part of the summer landscape. You can find lupine fields in Reykjavík, near the Skógafoss waterfall, and lining the road to the Hellissandur Church in the Snæfellsnes Peninsula, as seen in today's image.

> It's Pollinator Week, celebrating the small heroes who help plants flourish. While some plants are self-pollinating, or pollinated by wind or water, most are fertilized with the help of bees, wasps, butterflies, moths, birds—like the green-crowned brilliant hummingbird in today's image—and bats. The non-profit organization Pollinator Partnership is behind the event, which aims to raise awareness about how we can help protect them from threats including habitat loss, pollution, pesticides, and climate change. Should we care? Absolutely! From fruits and veggies to nuts, chocolate, or sugarcane, there are plenty of ingredients in our diet that are brought to us by pollinators, which are a crucial part of our agriculture and ecosystems.

> Today's all about the dads. Father's Day is the perfect time to celebrate everything they do for us, how they look after us, help us grow up, and tell the best dad jokes. There are also great dads in the animal kingdom, like the foxy father seen in today's image. Female red foxes need to stay in their dens with their young after giving birth, so males spend their time going out to bring her food. When the pups are a little older, their father takes time to play with them, teaching them survival skills they'll need in later life, like hunting and scavenging. The foxes seen here don't look red because they are melanistic, a genetic mutation causing an excess of dark pigmentation. This type of red fox is commonly called a silver fox. He might not get a card for his troubles but we're sure he is much appreciated. On Father's Day, why not call your dad, take him out for a meal, and show him how much he means to you.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Let's hit the waves for International Surfing Day! This event both celebrates the sport and promotes protecting the ocean for wildlife and surfers alike. Surfing has a long history; around 5,000 years ago in Peru, people used reed watercraft to surf the waves when they were out fishing. Polynesians are believed to have brought their version of surfing to Hawaii, where modern surfing was born. Here, people started to stand on their boards and to surf for fun. Historians believe that surfing made its way to the US in 1885, when three teenage Hawaiian princes surfed on redwood boards while on a break from boarding school in California.
> 
> Today's image shows an intrepid surfer riding a wave at Nazaré, Portugal. This town on the Atlantic coast is known for its giant waves, which can reach over 100 feet in height. Thanks to these impressive breakers, several surf records have been broken here, including the biggest wave ever surfed—an incredible 86 feet. So, wax down your surfboards and go out and catch some waves!

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
