<summary>Description</summary>

> Being the 'black sheep' isn't always a bad thing—just ask the Scottish Blackface, seen here in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. With its striking dark features and a knack for thriving in places where others wouldn't, this British breed has turned the idiom on its head. Far from an outcast, it's the backbone of Scotland's rural life and a true champion of the hills and moors. Interestingly, the Blackface sheep didn't originate in Scotland but south of the Anglo-Scottish border.
> 
> The breed's history is fascinating, and varieties such as the large-framed Perth and the medium-framed Lanark types are found throughout the United Kingdom. Not only is it the most common breed in the UK, but the Blackface sheep has spread across the world, including to the US. Its coarse fleece is perfect for making durable products like carpets and tweeds—it's definitely not your average sweater material.

> Two colossal stone hands cradle a shimmering, golden walkway, as though the mountains themselves are offering it to the sky. This is Cầu Vàng, or the Golden Bridge, a pedestrian bridge in the misty mountains near Da Nang in central Vietnam. Opened in 2018, the bridge quickly became a global sensation, captivating travelers with its unique design and awe-inspiring setting.
> 
> Unlike conventional bridges, the Golden Bridge doesn't span a river or lake. Instead, it stretches 490 feet across lush landscapes, connecting two cable car stations—Marseille Station and Bordeaux Station in Thien Thai Garden. Made from reinforced concrete and framed by hands crafted from steel mesh and fiberglass, the bridge creates an image of timeless strength amid modern ingenuity. Suspended around 3,200 feet above sea level, the walkway offers visitors a panoramic view of the verdant countryside. A symbol of Vietnam's creativity and natural beauty, the Golden Bridge invites you to experience a stroll like no other.

> Part engineering genius, part daredevil stunt—that's the Ribblehead Viaduct in North Yorkshire, England. This Victorian structure, also known as Batty Moss Viaduct, has been carrying trains and turning heads since the 1870s. Built by the Midland Railway, it's the longest and third tallest on the Settle–Carlisle railway line. Stretching 440 yards across the Ribble Valley, its 24 stone arches reach a height of 104 feet.
> 
> Construction of the viaduct employed more than 2,000 men who lived in nearby shantytowns; tragically, more than 100 workers lost their lives during the project. In the 1980s, British Rail proposed shutting down the line, but public outcry saved it from closure. Today, the Ribblehead Viaduct remains a symbol of resilience and a marvel of historical significance, attracting visitors from around the world.

> It's Groundhog Day … again. Today, Americans and Canadians rely on the prognostication skills of Punxsutawney Phil to determine if winter will hang on. Phil is a famous groundhog, also known as a woodchuck, and legend has it that if he emerges from his burrow February 2 and sees his own shadow, he'll go back to sleep for another six weeks of winter. If he doesn't, it will be an early spring. German immigrants brought the custom to America, where it was first celebrated in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, in 1887. Historically, Europeans celebrated February 2 as the first day of spring, and Germans originally watched badgers and other small animals for signs of seasonal change important to farmers. The Germans who settled in Pennsylvania in the 18th and 19th centuries chose the area's native groundhog for this task.
> 
> The alpine marmot in today's image is a close relative of the groundhog, which is another species of marmot. Marmots are the heaviest members of the squirrel family, and the alpine species is native to central and southern Europe. Its North American cousin, the groundhog, is a highly intelligent lowland rodent that forms intricate social networks, but it's a so-so weather forecaster.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today, the United States begins an annual, monthlong celebration of African Americans and their contributions to the country's history and culture. The forerunner of Black History Month was created in 1926 by historian Carter Woodson and minister Jesse Moorland to study and promote the legacy of Black Americans. The weeklong celebration was observed in the second week of February to coincide with the birthdays of President Abraham Lincoln and African American abolitionist Frederick Douglass. Its popularity grew over the next 50 years in large part because of the civil rights movement, and President Gerald Ford expanded it to a full month in 1976. Other countries honor their own Black histories, including Canada, which also celebrates Black History Month throughout February.
> 
> Seen in today's image, the National Museum of African American History & Culture is an excellent resource to learn about African American pioneers. Part of the Smithsonian Institution and found on the National Mall in Washington, DC, the museum was opened in a 2016 ceremony led by President Barack Obama. It's the world's largest African American museum with more than 40,000 artifacts and offers free daily admission with online reservations.

> Celebrate the beauty of zebras on International Zebra Day! These striking animals, known for their unique black and white patterns, are mostly found in the African savanna, stretching from Kenya to South Africa. Of the three zebra species, Grévy's zebra, plains zebra, and mountain zebra, the Grévy's zebra is the most endangered, with more than half its population lost in only three decades. While plains zebras are thriving, mountain zebras face significant threats, such as poaching and habitat encroachment. Zebras play an essential role in the ecosystems they live in, coexisting with predators like lions and hyenas while shaping the grasslands they call home.
> 
> In today's picture, we see two plains zebras—which are anything but plain—at sunrise in Mokala National Park, South Africa. International Zebra Day raises awareness about the challenges these animals face and encourages conservation efforts to ensure their survival. Whether by learning more or supporting wildlife initiatives, we can all play a role in protecting these fascinating creatures.

> High up in the Pyrenees, there is a gap in the mountains. More than 300 feet tall and 131 feet across, La Brecha de Rolando (Roland's Breach), featured here today, is a sight to behold. But who was Roland? Count Roland was a Frankish military leader during Charlemagne's reign in the 8th century. Legend has it that, after being defeated in battle, Roland cut a gap in the mountains—either to destroy his sword or to catch one last glimpse of France.
> 
> Roland's Breach lies within the Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park in Spain, right on the border with France. Covering more than 38,000 acres, the park is home to some spectacular limestone formations. It's made up of four different valleys and one peak—Monte Perdido—which towers more than 11,000 feet above sea level. It even has its own glacier, Monte Perdido, which is the fourth largest in the Pyrenees. A wide range of animals live in this mountainous landscape, including wild boars, Pyrenean chamois, and brown bears.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
