> Today is European Day of Parks! On this day in 1909, Europe's first nine national parks were founded in Sweden. This year, the celebration highlights how protected areas help shape nature policies and contribute to building sustainable societies. These areas are more than just guardians of biodiversity; they are also pillars of our collective well-being, reminding us to preserve our natural heritage.

> Today's image showcases Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park in the Pyrenees Mountains of northeastern Spain. The park was established with the primary aim of preserving the high mountain landscape of the surrounding region. Characterized by its rugged terrain, the area has limestone formations and a plethora of karst features, including sinkholes and caves.

> Here is a real star! The Indian star tortoise walks into today's image with exemplary confidence. And rightly so: Today is World Turtle Day. What's the difference between tortoises and turtles? Tortoises are a family of turtles that exclusively live on land.
> 
> Today, we know of more than 350 species of turtles, living on all continents except Antarctica. Did you know that these animals originated around 200 million years ago, which means that they are one of the oldest reptile groups on the planet? Or that some species can live up to 150 years? So let's respect and protect these shelled creatures—some of them are older than our grandparents.

> Today we're celebrating the biodiversity of our planet. What exactly is biodiversity? It refers to the variety of living things, from animals and plants to fungi and microorganisms, in one area. This delicate but vigorous balance in nature is what keeps us all alive. That's definitely worth celebrating! May 22 was named International Day for Biological Diversity by the United Nations in 2000. Unfortunately, the biodiversity of Earth is slowly decreasing due to climate change, the draining of natural resources, urbanization, and pollution, among other factors. Campaigners are urging governments, businesses and individuals to take action to boost biodiversity, to protect healthy ecosystems that supply us with water, food, medicines, and more. After all, we are blessed with intriguing species such as the Tasmanian snow gum—the tree seen in today's image—that takes root in one of the most biologically diverse places on the planet, the Mount Field National Park in Tasmania, Australia.

> There's nothing quite like a nice cup of tea. Whether you like Darjeeling, Earl Grey, oolong, matcha, or English breakfast, today's the day to celebrate this beloved brew: May 21 is International Tea Day. People have been drinking tea for at least 5,000 years. The drink originated in China, but in the 16th and 17th centuries, it was introduced to Western merchants, who helped to spread it around the world. It is now the second-most consumed drink in the world after water.

> Today's photo takes us to Malaysia and the tea plantations of the Cameron Highlands. Located around 120 miles north of Kuala Lumpur, the Cameron Highlands' cooler climate and high altitude make it perfect for tea growing. The area is a popular tourist destination, offering visitors stunning landscapes to explore, including rolling hills, towering mountains, and an ancient cloud forest.

> We're really buzzing: Today is World Bee Day, a chance to celebrate these industrious insects and the vital role they play in biodiversity and agriculture. Bees come in a range of sizes, from just 0.08 inches all the way up to 2.5 inches, and there are over 20,000 known species. One of the most important pollinators, they help keep trees, flowers, and crops alive, helping to secure food chains as well as boosting biodiversity. It's no overstatement to say that bees are vital for humans' survival.

> Honey bees, like the one in today's image, construct nests from wax and produce honey to sustain the colony through the winter months. Humans have been keeping bees in artificial hives for around 10,000 years.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Perched on the rugged cliffs of the Italian Riviera, Vernazza is one of the five villages of the Cinque Terre area of northwestern Italy. Here, ancient buildings stand along the coastline of the Ligurian Sea, and life is filled with the hustle and bustle of the fishing industry. Vernazza got its name from the indigenous wine, 'vernaccia,' meaning 'local' or 'ours.' One of the best-known monuments in the area is the medieval Doria Castle, built as a defensive fortress to protect the village from frequent pirate attacks. Thanks to the construction of the Genoa–La Spezia rail line in the 19th century, the village became more accessible by land. The car-free cobblestone streets are ideal for walking around. While here, you might want to visit the Chapel of Santa Marta and the Sanctuary of Madonna di Reggio. Vernazza is sometimes described as the pearl of the Cinque Terre with its natural port, colorful houses, and green terraces overlooking a sparkling sea.
