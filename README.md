> They've been growing olives on the Spanish island of Majorca in the western Mediterranean for more than 2,000 years. Early settlers, the Phoenicians and Greeks, introduced the first olive trees but the groves in the Serra de Tramuntana range expanded during Spain's Islamic era, between 709 and 1492. Olive oil became a crucial ingredient in culinary traditions on Majorca, the largest of the Balearic Islands. One ancient tree on the island, Can Det, is estimated to be more than 1,100 years old, and is still producing olives.
> 
> In 2011, the Serra de Tramuntana was established as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Today, tourists from all over the world visit the archipelago to taste history and the 'liquid gold.'

<summary>Description</summary>

> Diwali, the five-day festival of lights, holds significance in Hinduism, Jainism, and Sikhism. It is celebrated widely both in India, and in countries across the world with an Indian diaspora. The name 'Diwali' comes from the Sanskrit term 'Dipavali,' which means 'row of lights,' and the heart of the festival lies in the oil lamps, or 'diyas,' which illuminate homes and public spaces. They create a dazzling spectacle symbolizing the triumph of knowledge over ignorance and good over evil. The city of Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh, India, pictured in today's image, hosts one of the world's largest displays of oil lamps. Hundreds of thousands of diyas are lit on the banks of the Sarayu River during Diwali.

> Today we're at the Washington Monument to pay tribute to those who have served in the US Armed Forces. Over 41 million Americans have been in our military since the US Army was established in 1775, and today, on Veterans Day, we salute their service. Veterans Day started as Armistice Day, a commemoration of the end of combat in World War 1. In 1954, it was renamed Veterans Day, expanding its scope to honor all people who have served. Over 6% of Americans, more than 16 million people, are veterans. Their service will be recognised today at the Veterans Day National Ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, and in parades and other events across the country.

> The strange stripes in our homepage image reveal tiers of fossil beds in Badlands National Park in South Dakota. Beneath the multicolored surface lies the land's history, including the remains of ancient horses, camels, tigers, and rhinos. The barren landscape, dotted with pinnacles and prairies, was formed by two geological processes: deposition, where the layered rocks were gradually stacked up on top of each other by inland seas, winds, and rivers over millions of years, and erosion, which began about 500,000 years ago. The Red Shirt Table, at 3,340 feet, is the highest point in the park, which was established on this day in 1978. It protects 379 square miles of rocky buttes, pinnacles, and prairies. This inhospitable terrain was called 'Mako Sica,' or 'land bad' by the Oglala Lakota people, who have lived here for hundreds of years. Still thirsty for knowledge? Visit the national park's museum collection. There are over 360,000 objects that have a lot more to reveal!

> Today we're celebrating the lovely manatee! These marvelous marine mammals have a fascinating history that spans millions of years. They are related to elephants and their ancestors can be traced back to the Eocene era (about 56 to 33.9 million years ago), making them one of the oldest mammals on Earth. These slow-moving herbivores have, over time, adapted to life in warm, coastal waters.

> These sleepy creatures are friendly towards humans but boat collisions and habitat loss are among their biggest threats. Our homepage manatees are pictured in Three Sisters Springs, in Florida's Crystal River, where hundreds of manatees arrive to spend the winter months in warmer waters. If you visit the area and come across a West Indian manatee, we encourage you to take a moment to appreciate them, but from a distance.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Curving above the treetops of Biržai Regional Park in northern Lithuania, this unusual structure allows a bird's-eye view of a unique landscape. Built in 2015, the Kirkilai Observation Tower's shape is said to resemble a sinking boat, appropriate in an area dotted with water-filled sink holes. About 30 of these small lakes can be seen from the top of the tower, nearly 100 feet in the air. These lakes can be up to 36 feet deep and are just some of the thousands of sinkholes identified in the park. Water-soluble rocks like gypsum lie under the soil in this area, and over time they gradually erode, forming caves, which then collapse. In some cases, they fill with water, creating this mesmerizing landscape. The interconnected lakes mirror the surrounding greenery, creating a scenic haven for nature enthusiasts.
