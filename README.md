> The Galápagos Islands in the eastern Pacific are a paradise for wildlife. Habitats range from arid regions to tropical rainforests. Because these islands are so isolated, many of the species that live here are not found anywhere else in the world. One species found in abundance is the Nazca booby, pictured here on Wolf Island. The name might raise a few eyebrows, but it actually comes from the Spanish word 'bobo,' meaning clown, because of the birds' clumsy demeanor when they're walking.
> 
> The Galápagos archipelago, including the remote and rugged outpost of Wolf Island, provides an ideal habitat for these seabirds. The island's steep cliffs and rocky shores offer perfect nesting sites, while the surrounding waters teem with fish, providing ample food. Visiting the Galápagos offers an incredible opportunity to see these birds in their natural habitat, along with the chance to explore one of the most biodiverse regions on the planet.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Mind-blowing beauty is one reason people keep coming back to Wyoming and the Grand Teton National Park. Named 'les trois tétons' by early French trappers, the park was created in 1929 by conservationists including John D. Rockefeller Jr. It is home to a virtually untouched ecosystem of plants and animals, such as grizzly bears, wolves, bison, moose, and bald eagles.
> 
> Just 10 miles south of Yellowstone National Park, the park's 40-mile-long Teton Range is one of North America's youngest mountain ranges. At less than 10 million years old, erosion has not yet had time to smooth the edges of the mountains, hence the Tetons' jagged peaks. Many of the park's lakes, including 15-mile-long Jackson Lake, were carved out by glaciers hundreds of thousands of years ago. Towering over Jackson Hole and reflected in one of its many lakes, the Tetons and the park are a breathtaking sight to behold.

> Established in 1939 to honor Orville Wright's birthday, National Aviation Day kicks off a week-long celebration of America's long history of flight. Pioneers Orville and Wilbur Wright designed, built, and flew the world's first engine-powered airplane near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in 1903. America's love of flight, however, goes all the way back to 1793, when President George Washington watched a hot air balloon launch in Philadelphia.
> 
> Today, let your imagination soar at the Museum of Flight in Seattle. With nearly 200 airplanes and spacecraft, dozens of exhibits, and thousands of artifacts, the museum is the largest independent air and space museum in the world. If you can't get to the museum in person, it has numerous online resources to explore. Feel free to daydream about life among the clouds and stars—your fellow Americans have been doing it for more than 200 years.

> In today's image, we see the sun disappearing below the pier at Huntington Beach, California. First built in 1902, the pier was damaged by a storm and had to be rebuilt just nine years later. During World War II, a submarine lookout post was installed on the pier to help with the war effort. These days, it's a popular spot for fishing and watching surfers ride the waves out in the Pacific Ocean.
> 
> Huntington Beach has been nicknamed Surf City, and it's not hard to see why. Its 9.5-mile-long sandy beach gets great waves all year round. And it is home to the International Surf Museum, where visitors can learn about the history of the sport and see historic surfboards. Whether you're hitting the waves or watching from the pier, Huntington Beach is a peerless destination.

> The lighthouse featured in today's image stands in southern Portugal's popular Algarve region. Built in 1919, Alfanzina Lighthouse helps ships navigate dangerous waters near the town of Carvoeiro. A popular tourist destination, the lighthouse also has become a symbol of the region's deep links to the sea. If you're lucky enough to live near a lighthouse, this weekend is the perfect time to pay it a visit.
> 
> Today marks the start of International Lighthouse and Lightship Weekend, celebrating this vital maritime infrastructure. Originally, lighthouses were powered by fires and oil lamps, requiring lighthouse keepers to maintain them. These days, however, most lighthouses have been automated and installed with electric light sources. In waters that are too deep or otherwise unsuitable to build a lighthouse, lightships—moored vessels outfitted with beacon lights—have often been used.

<summary>Description</summary>

> From single rails to virtual reality, roller coasters have been thrilling people for centuries. Their origins can be traced back to 17th-century Russia, where wooden slides—'Russian Mountains'—provided seasonal entertainment. The first roller coaster was built in early 19th-century Paris, France. Called 'Les Montagnes Russes à Belleville,' it featured wheeled carts securely attached to tracks. By the 1900s, coasters were looping the loop for the first time.
> 
> Pictured here is a hybrid coaster that combines wood and steel—Hakugei, the White Whale of Japan in Nagashima Spa Land. Once known as White Cyclone, this beast underwent a transformation in 2019. The ride's wooden track was replaced with steel. Its metamorphosis not only revved up its velocity and propelled it to new heights but also introduced gravity-defying inversions. So, if you find yourself in Japan, brave the Hakugei—buckle up and take the plunge, and emerge with a tale as epic as the ride itself.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In 1991, logger Hồ Khanh stumbled upon something big in what is now Vietnam's Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park. During a jungle expedition, he found the entrance to a cave with a roaring underground river. It was later named Hang Sơn Đoòng, or 'cave of the mountain river' and in 2009, the British Cave Research Association led an expedition to explore it. They realized something incredible: It was the world's largest cave. Hang Sơn Đoòng's main passage is 3.1 miles long, 490 feet wide, and 660 feet high. That's tall enough to fit a 40-story skyscraper.
> 
> Inside the cave, there is a 200-foot calcite barrier called the 'Great Wall of Vietnam' and stalagmites stretching as tall as 260 feet. It even has its own weather system; clouds form inside due to temperature differences between the cave air and the outside air. Moreover, an underground river links Hang Sơn Đoòng to the nearby Hang Thung cave, suggesting undiscovered depths. Given its fragile ecosystem, strict regulations are in place to preserve Hang Sơn Đoòng's pristine condition. Tours of the cave are limited to 1,000 visitors per year.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
