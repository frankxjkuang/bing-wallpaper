> Porto Timoni beach, in Corfu, Greece, is a hidden gem reached either by boat, or by hiking from the historic village of Afionas. Those who make the journey are rewarded with two stunning coves, offering a unique double-beach experience. With clear turquoise waters and dramatic cliffs, Porto Timoni presents a picturesque coastal panorama. Surrounding the beach, lush olive groves and cypress trees add to its charm. Greek islands like Corfu may seem timeless and ancient but they are relatively new in the history of Earth. A leading theory is that around 5.3 million years ago, a great flood poured in between Africa and Europe from the Atlantic Ocean, an event called the Zanclean flood. Lakes became oceans and what were previously mountaintops became islands.

> Break out the BBQ and unfurl your flags, Independence Day is here! Founding Father John Adams wrote to his wife, Abigail, that he believed the holiday would be celebrated with parades, sports, shows, and illuminations. After 247 years, Americans are keeping those traditions alive, though not on the date that Adams anticipated. The Second Continental Congress voted to approve the independence of the United States of America on July 2, 1776, but formally adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4. That date, enshrined on the Declaration document, became the one we observe today. If you're looking for a grand way to celebrate, journey to New York City for views of their annual fireworks show and the Empire State Building lit up to match in red, white, and blue.

> Is it hot enough for you? Chances are it is, as we get into what are typically the hottest months of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, thanks to the tilt of the Earth angling more towards the sun in summer. You may have heard this sweltering period called the dog days of summer, though that name doesn't come from hot dogs or panting pooches. Rather it comes from Sirius, the Dog Star, which becomes visible above the eastern horizon at daybreak during the summer. Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky, and is part of Canis Major, not to be confused with the Canis latrans, or coyote, in today's image, who is just trying to beat the heat.

> Today is Halfway Day, which means we are halfway through 2023! Halfway Day begins at noon on July 2 during a regular 365-day year, and at midnight on July 2 during a leap year—so this year, we're celebrating at lunchtime.
> 
> Dutch engineers don’t do things by halves. Pictured here is the Veluwemeer Aqueduct in the Netherlands. The project, completed in 2002, used an unusual engineering approach. Rather than a drawbridge or ferry to get cars over Lake Veluwemeer, engineers instead built this 'water bridge' to carry boats across the road. The N302 is a busy highway connecting the mainland to the province of Flevoland, and thanks to this design, both road and waterborne traffic can keep flowing freely. The aqueduct also has pedestrian crossings on both sides, so everyone benefits. No half measures were taken in designing an eye-catching transport solution that works for everyone.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The first stage of the Tour de France, known as the Grand Départ, begins today, as the 110th edition of the world's most famous cycling race gets underway. The grueling event, first held in 1903, sees teams race more than 2,100 miles through the Pyrenees and the Alps to finish on the Champs-Élysées in Paris. The competition is divided into 21 day-long stages and while some parts stay the same, others vary from year to year. For example, our image features the Pont du Gard—an ancient Roman aqueduct bridge that was built during the first century AD—which only appeared in the 2019 race. The entire event takes place over a 23-day period, including rest days, as teams of eight cyclists compete for a cash prize and the coveted yellow jersey. For these riders, this competition is the apex of years of training and dedication. Bonne chance!

> In the pristine landscapes of Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, Alaska, brown bears reign supreme. These magnificent creatures, also known as grizzly bears, are an iconic symbol of the untamed wilderness. Impressive in size, adult males can exceed 1,000 pounds and reach a standing height of 10 feet. Their thick, shaggy fur—varying in shades from blond to dark brown—provides insulation against the harsh Alaskan winter.
> 
> Brown bears are opportunistic omnivores, and their diet comprises berries, fish, small mammals, and carrion. They show off their amazing fishing skills in the park's rivers and lakes, particularly during the annual salmon runs. Lake Clark National Park and Preserve offers these magnificent creatures a sanctuary to roam, thrive, and prepare for each year's hibernation.

The Banyak Islands offer miles of pristine sandy beaches, lush green trees, and clear waters as far as the eyes can see. This tropical paradise also boasts some great surfing and snorkeling spots and draws millions of visitors a year.

They also make up approximately one-third of the Earth’s landmass and are home to about 40% of the world’s population. On June 29, International Day of the Tropics celebrates the uniqueness and biodiversity of the tropics, while highlighting their challenges and progress made to address them.
