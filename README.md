<summary>Description</summary>

> Three… two… one… wait—hold that countdown. It's not New Year's yet, but the Oberbaum Bridge already feels as if Berlin hit its 'celebrate' button ahead of time. On this night, the bridge transforms from a simple river crossing into a runway where this city taxis toward midnight, engines humming, fireworks warming up, and the crowd collectively practicing its 'Happy New Year!' voice.
> 
> Wedged perfectly between Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg, the bridge sits at the meeting point of two neighborhoods across the River Spree that approach the eve with completely different strategies. Friedrichshain shows up with club beats and street snacks. Kreuzberg brings laid-back bars and last-minute toasts. The Oberbaum Bridge? From here, the scene is pure improvisation—bursts of color from rooftops, random sparkles from the riverbanks, and occasional 'Was that meant to go sideways?' moments. The bridge's iconic red-brick towers watch over it all, steady and unfazed. These towers once marked the divide between East and West Berlin, but tonight they mark something far better: togetherness. Here's to crossing into another year—one step, one cheer, and one firework at a time.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In Japan's colder months, there's a morning moment when stillness breaks—not with wind or footsteps, but with a bright, rolling call that sweeps across the water. Whooper swans have touched down. One loud whoop—and winter suddenly feels awake. These birds migrate from Siberia and the Russian Far East, choosing Japan as their seasonal home because its lakes offer what long-distance travelers crave: open water, steady food, and a safe place to rest. One of their favorite destinations is Kotoku Pond in the Kantō region on Japan's largest island.
> 
> Whooper swans make an impression from the start, with tall necks, white feathers, and yellow-and-black bills. Add a call that carries miles, and they become impossible to miss. Families migrate together, keep close on the water, and coordinate flights with those trumpet-like notes. At places like Kotoku Pond, dawn departures are the highlight. While in Japan, their diet is simple: grains, aquatic plants, and grasses. Moreover, healthy wetlands attract them, and their return each winter signals that the ecosystem is thriving.

<summary>Description</summary>

> On a windswept plateau in eastern Türkiye, along the border with Armenia, the ruins of the ancient city of Ani rise from the landscape with striking clarity. A millennium ago, Ani was a thriving Armenian capital on a major Silk Road route, its fortifications and busy streets shaping trade and culture across the region. Today, the city is quiet, but its outline still carries the weight of its past.
> 
> The image shows the Church of St. Gregory, one of Ani's most striking survivors. Built from dark volcanic stone, its tall cylindrical tower stands over the plateau with the same precision that once defined the city. Ani was known as the 'City of 1,001 Churches,' and its architects pushed new ideas in arches, domes, and facades that later influenced Gothic tradition. Even in ruin, the design remains deliberate and unmistakable.
> 
> Ani's decline unfolded through earthquakes, invasions, and shifting trade routes, yet the city never fully disappeared. Archaeologists continue to find new details, and conservation work fights erosion and time. Walking here feels less like exploring a ruin and more like meeting a city determined to keep its story alive.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Fifty-one years after the Endangered Species Act (ESA) became law, its purpose remains clear: to protect species facing extinction and preserve the habitats they depend on. Signed in 1973, the ESA became one of the world's strongest conservation laws, influencing policies well beyond the United States. It demonstrates that recovery is possible when science and enforcement work together. Its influence on conservation is especially clear in species whose futures hinge on international attention. The black-and-white ruffed lemur of Madagascar is one such example. Many people recognize lemurs from the animated movie 'Madagascar,' but the real animal faces a much harsher reality. This striking primate is critically endangered, surviving in increasingly fragmented forests where habitat loss remains a constant threat.
> 
> According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the species has undergone a severe population decline driven by deforestation and hunting. Conservation programs, global funding, and science-based protections continue to be essential—reflecting the same principles the ESA helped establish half a century ago.

<summary>Description</summary>

> When winter tightens its grip on Lake Superior in Minnesota, the shoreline transforms into a landscape of tilted, glass-like shards known as plate ice. Thin sheets fracture under shifting temperatures, then drift and stack as the wind presses them toward land. The result is a field of translucent blues and silvers, catching the light at sharp angles and making the water's edge appear sculpted rather than frozen.
> 
> Beneath the surface, waves keep moving, pushing the slabs against one another as they scrape, ring, and groan. The sounds rise and fall with the motion, turning the shoreline into a fleeting, shifting performance. These formations can appear suddenly and disappear just as quickly, changing with every gust and temperature dip.
> 
> Lake Superior's immense scale shapes this phenomenon. As the world's largest freshwater lake by surface area, spanning about 31,700 square miles, its depth, wind patterns, and temperature swings set the stage for this winter display. Its Ojibwe name, 'Gichigami,' from the Indigenous people of the region, reflects its long-standing reputation as a 'great sea.'

> The best thing about Boxing Day is that it doesn't ask much of you. No big countdown. No dramatic unwrapping. No last-minute dashes for batteries. It's a rare holiday that says, 'Sit down, finish your leftovers, and take a moment.' Celebrated on December 26 in the United Kingdom and some Commonwealth countries, it's a national cool-down after Christmas has done all the heavy lifting. The term goes back to Victorian Britain, when households prepared Christmas boxes for workers and tradespeople—tokens of thanks that ranged from coins to essentials. Churches joined in by opening alms boxes and distributing donations.
> 
> Fast-forward to today: Boxing Day has evolved into a hybrid of tradition and modern habits. Football fixtures turn the day into a fan festival. Outdoor walks help shake off the seasonal food coma. And then there are the sales that inspire early lines and brisk browsing. For those who prefer scenery over discounts, places like Salisbury Cathedral in England, shown in today's image, offer a peaceful escape. Brave souls plunge into icy waters for Boxing Day swims. Old-style fox hunts have shifted to ceremonial, non-hunting events, keeping the pageantry alive without the chase.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Beneath Heidelberg's winter sky in Germany, stalls sparkle with snow globes, each capturing the spirit of the season in a miniature world. Today, Christmas—a Christian celebration of faith, light, and togetherness—invites us to welcome warmth and joy into the coldest days of the year. Across continents, candles glow on windowsills and garlands twine through homes and streets.
> 
> Germany was the cradle of many of these traditions, which were born in medieval towns and passed down through centuries of storytelling. Among these customs are the decorated tree, the Advent calendar, and the Christmas market that fills cities with the scent of roasted nuts, cinnamon, and spiced wine. Amid the swirl of snow and song, these markets feel as timeless as the snow globes they showcase. For a fleeting moment, there's a pause in the winter rush, where wonder lingers just long enough to be savored.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
