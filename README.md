> Today we're celebrating the biodiversity of our planet. What exactly is biodiversity? It refers to the variety of living things, from animals and plants to fungi and microorganisms, in one area. This delicate but vigorous balance in nature is what keeps us all alive. That's definitely worth celebrating! May 22 was named International Day for Biological Diversity by the United Nations in 2000. Unfortunately, the biodiversity of Earth is slowly decreasing due to climate change, the draining of natural resources, urbanization, and pollution, among other factors. Campaigners are urging governments, businesses and individuals to take action to boost biodiversity, to protect healthy ecosystems that supply us with water, food, medicines, and more. After all, we are blessed with intriguing species such as the Tasmanian snow gum—the tree seen in today's image—that takes root in one of the most biologically diverse places on the planet, the Mount Field National Park in Tasmania, Australia.

> There's nothing quite like a nice cup of tea. Whether you like Darjeeling, Earl Grey, oolong, matcha, or English breakfast, today's the day to celebrate this beloved brew: May 21 is International Tea Day. People have been drinking tea for at least 5,000 years. The drink originated in China, but in the 16th and 17th centuries, it was introduced to Western merchants, who helped to spread it around the world. It is now the second-most consumed drink in the world after water.

> Today's photo takes us to Malaysia and the tea plantations of the Cameron Highlands. Located around 120 miles north of Kuala Lumpur, the Cameron Highlands' cooler climate and high altitude make it perfect for tea growing. The area is a popular tourist destination, offering visitors stunning landscapes to explore, including rolling hills, towering mountains, and an ancient cloud forest.

> We're really buzzing: Today is World Bee Day, a chance to celebrate these industrious insects and the vital role they play in biodiversity and agriculture. Bees come in a range of sizes, from just 0.08 inches all the way up to 2.5 inches, and there are over 20,000 known species. One of the most important pollinators, they help keep trees, flowers, and crops alive, helping to secure food chains as well as boosting biodiversity. It's no overstatement to say that bees are vital for humans' survival.

> Honey bees, like the one in today's image, construct nests from wax and produce honey to sustain the colony through the winter months. Humans have been keeping bees in artificial hives for around 10,000 years.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Perched on the rugged cliffs of the Italian Riviera, Vernazza is one of the five villages of the Cinque Terre area of northwestern Italy. Here, ancient buildings stand along the coastline of the Ligurian Sea, and life is filled with the hustle and bustle of the fishing industry. Vernazza got its name from the indigenous wine, 'vernaccia,' meaning 'local' or 'ours.' One of the best-known monuments in the area is the medieval Doria Castle, built as a defensive fortress to protect the village from frequent pirate attacks. Thanks to the construction of the Genoa–La Spezia rail line in the 19th century, the village became more accessible by land. The car-free cobblestone streets are ideal for walking around. While here, you might want to visit the Chapel of Santa Marta and the Sanctuary of Madonna di Reggio. Vernazza is sometimes described as the pearl of the Cinque Terre with its natural port, colorful houses, and green terraces overlooking a sparkling sea.

> Today, on Endangered Species Day, we unite in a collective effort for conservation. Currently, there are over 44,000 species that are threatened with extinction. Among the world's most endangered animals are Javan and black rhinos, mountain gorillas, and Hawksbill turtles.
> 
> Today, let us take you to the Tarangire National Park in Tanzania, where African elephants roam freely. These gentle giants are characterized by their large, flapping ears, long trunks, and curved tusks. They live in small family groups led by a matriarch and while they are known to noisily trumpet, they also communicate over distances through low-frequency sound waves. Unfortunately, threats like habitat loss and poaching have left them on the brink of extinction. Endangered Species Day highlights efforts to protect all endangered animal and plant species worldwide, big and small.

> Happy International Day of Light! Held on May 16, it marks the anniversary of the invention of the laser by the American physicist and engineer Theodore Maiman in 1960. This pioneering creation helped revolutionize fields from communications to health care and lasers are now found in everything from printers and barcode scanners to surgical devices. Today's event also celebrates light's presence in every aspect of human existence, from art and culture to science and technology.

> Today's image features 'Feelings Are Facts,' a collaborative installation by Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson and Beijing-based architect Ma Yansong. In 2010 it filled the Great Hall of the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing with illuminated fog. A grid of lights partitioned the haze into the primary colors of red, green, and blue, blending seamlessly at intersections to create transitional hues of cyan, magenta, and yellow. Gallery visitors relied solely on intersecting hues of colored fields to navigate the fog.
