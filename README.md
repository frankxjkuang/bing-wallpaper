> As the sun rises over the hills in Somerset, Glastonbury Festival comes alive, transforming a quiet part of South West England into one of the world's most famous music destinations. Since its humble beginnings in 1970, when tickets cost just one British pound, Glastonbury has grown into a cultural powerhouse, attracting over 200,000 fans each year. The festival is deeply rooted in the ideals of the hippie movement, the 1960s counterculture, and the free festival spirit that sparked its early days. From David Bowie and Elton John to Metallica and Billie Eilish, Glastonbury's stages have hosted performances that have defined generations. This year's festival runs from today through June 29, with The 1975, Neil Young, and Olivia Rodrigo topping the bill. Overlooking the event is Glastonbury Tor, pictured here, a hill crowned by the 14th-century St. Michael's Church Tower. The Tor is steeped in myth and legend, from ties to King Arthur's Avalon to ancient spiritual lore.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This place wasn't built overnightâ€”nature took its time to craft this masterpiece. What you see at Arches National Park, Utah, is the result of over 300 million years of erosion, uplift, and weathering. These arches were formed when salt beds were left behind by ancient seas. Over time, layers of sandstone cracked, shifted, and slowly wore away, revealing more than 2,000 natural arches. These formations are made mostly of Entrada and Navajo sandstone. The park was recognized as a national monument in 1929 and was later upgraded to national park status in 1971.
> 
> Delicate Arch, in Arches National Park, is one of the most recognizable natural arches in the American Southwest. Originally known by several other namesâ€”including 'the Chaps' and 'Salt Wash Arch'â€”it wasn't officially called Delicate Arch until the 1930s, after a scientific expedition described it as 'delicate-looking.' It is Utah's unofficial mascot, appearing on everything from state license plates to a United States postage stamp issued in 1996 to mark 100 years of Utah statehood. The arch is accessible via a moderately difficult hike that climbs over slickrock and skirts steep drop-offs. Whether you're a geology enthusiast or simply looking for a view worth the effort, Delicate Arch delivers.

> Berlin gets the buzz, Munich brings the beer, but what about Dresden, in eastern Germany? Dresden brings the story. The city, once called 'the Florence on the Elbe,' was nearly wiped off the map in 1945 during World War II. Since then, it has rebuilt itself into a place where modern museums, Baroque buildings, and riverside views share the same frame. Much of the city's oldest architecture can be found in the boroughs of Altstadt (Old Town) and Neustadt (New Town).
> 
> While you're here, consider strolling through Zwingerâ€”a palatial complexâ€”for a glimpse of royal history, or attending a performance at the Semperoper, where opera and architecture meet. The Old Masters Picture Gallery and the Green Vault are must-sees for art and history fans. The Elbe, stretching about 724 miles, flows through it allâ€”wide, steady, and quietly powerful.

> World Rainforest Day is not just a calendar eventâ€”it's a call to action. Established in 2017 by Rainforest Partnershipâ€”a nonprofit environmental organizationâ€”the day raises awareness about the importance of rainforests and mobilizes efforts to protect them. In the US, the occasion is marked with community tree plantings, school projects, and social media campaigns that highlight conservation successes. Many botanical gardens host special exhibits, while environmental groups run fundraising challenges to support on-the-ground protection efforts.
> 
> One notable region of the Amazon rainforest is in Ecuador. Although smaller than Brazil's share, it's considered one of the most biologically dense areas on Earth. It also shelters an extraordinary range of lifeâ€”jaguars, macaws, black caimans, electric eels, and medicinal plants, many still unknown to science. This part of the rainforest is home to Indigenous groups, including uncontacted tribes whose territories are legally protected. But their way of life is increasingly threatened by industrial activities, especially oil drilling. World Rainforest Day reminds us that the protection of rainforests is possible through personal choices and collective action. From reducing paper use to supporting rainforest-friendly products, people can make tangible impacts that reach Ecuador's Amazon and beyond.

> World Giraffe Day, celebrated on June 21, is a perfect opportunity to learn about the Serengeti and its iconic Masai giraffes. This annual event, organized by the Giraffe Conservation Foundation, raises awareness about the declining giraffe population, which has decreased by nearly 30% over the past 35 years.
> 
> Masai giraffes, known for their distinctive, jagged blotches, are native to East Africa. Besides Kenya and Uganda, they roam the vast plains of Tanzania's Serengeti, a name derived from the Maasai word 'seringit,' meaning 'endless plains.' Today's image captures a tender moment between a Masai giraffe mother and her calf in this stunning landscape. With only approximately 117,000 giraffes remaining in the wild, the time to act is now. By supporting World Giraffe Day, you can help ensure the survival of these incredible creatures and contribute to conservation efforts that protect their natural habitat. Join the celebration and make a difference for the tallest land animal on Earth.

> Experience the magic of the summer solstice at Seljalandsfoss waterfall in Iceland. Today, the Northern Hemisphere celebrates the longest day of the year, when the sun reaches its highest point in the sky. Seljalandsfoss, located along Iceland's South Coast, offers a stunning backdrop for this astronomical event.
> 
> The 197-foot waterfall drops from cliffs that once marked the country's coastline. The cascading water is part of the Seljalandsa River, originating from the volcanic glacier EyjafjallajÃ¶kull. The volcano under the icecap last erupted in 2010, causing disruption for locals and air traffic. Visitors can walk behind the falls into a small cave, offering a unique perspective and making it a favorite spot for photographers. Floodlights illuminate the waterfall at night, creating a magical scene. If you are planning a vacation during the summer solstice, Seljalandsfoss is worth adding to your travel bucket list. Whether you're a nature enthusiast or a photography lover, this experience promises unforgettable memories.

> Every year on June 19, the United States marks Juneteenth National Independence Day, a federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery. On this day in 1865â€”two and a half years after the Emancipation Proclamation was issuedâ€”Union Major General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, with news that over 250,000 enslaved people were finally free. Texas was the last Confederate state to enforce freedom, making Juneteenth a powerful symbol of delayed justice and ultimate liberation.
> 
> Celebrations began in Texas as early as 1866, often centered around churches and community gatherings. Over time, Juneteenth grew to include parades, food festivals, and reflections on African American history and culture. In recognition of its historical and cultural significance, Juneteenth was officially recognized as a federal holiday in 2021, making it the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1983. Today, Juneteenth serves as a time to honor the resilience of those who endured slavery and to reflect on the ongoing journey toward equality.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
