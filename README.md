<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> The quiver trees pictured on our homepage are uniquely suited to Namibia's hot, dry climate. They are not trees at all, but an endangered species of aloe plant. These succulents can grow up to 30 feet tall and live for 200 years. The name comes from the Indigenous San people who made quivers out of the plant's tube-shaped branches to hold their arrows while hunting. You can see scattered quiver trees across southern Namibia, but for sheer numbers, head to the Quiver Tree Forest, where more than 200 of these distinctive plants grow among dolerite rock formations outside the city of Keetmanshoop. In June and July, during Namibia's winter, you can see the plant's flowers in bright, yellow bloom.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to Sukhothai Historical Park, one of Thailand's most spectacular UNESCO World Heritage sites. The park is dotted with ancient temples, the remains of a palace, and towering Buddha statues—within its boundaries is the historic town of Sukhothai, an important metropolitan hub in the 13th and 14th centuries. The name translates as 'the dawn of happiness' and you can spend many happy hours here, strolling among the beautiful lawns, trees, and lakes. The temple on our homepage is Wat Si Sawai, one of the oldest on the site, founded in the late 12th or early 13th century. Sukhothai was the capital of the first Kingdom of Siam more than 700 years ago and this historic site continues to offer a window onto what is sometimes seen as a golden age of Thai civilization.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Nestled in a picturesque valley next to a lagoon flanked by mountains, Saksun is a small, remote village famous for its stunning vistas. It is situated on the coast of Streymoy in the remote Faroe Islands, which sit about halfway between Iceland and Scotland in the North Atlantic. Home to these iconic houses with turf roofs and a tiny population—estimates vary between 8 and 30—it is said that there are more waterfalls in Saksun, than houses.
> 
> There's something to be said about the beauty of Saksun and its power to hypnotize visitors with its peaceful atmosphere. It is a far cry from the relatively bustling streets of Tórshavn, the capital of the islands. With greenery as far as the eye can see, Saksun provides an almost otherworldly sense of solitude.

> The Old Fortress of Corfu, Greece (© Netfalls Remy Musser/Shutterstock)

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> This imposing structure is the Old Fortress on the Greek island of Corfu, off the western coasts of Greece and Albania. Situated in a strategic location between the Ionian and Adriatic seas, Corfu became one of the most fortified places in Europe amid successive sieges by the Ottoman Empire. The island was ruled by the Republic of Venice for 400 years until the late 18th century, which built forts in Corfu's Old Town to defend its maritime trading interests. They held off three Ottoman sieges in 1537, 1571, and 1716 but have been repaired, rebuilt, and added to over the centuries. The Old Fortress has witnessed the rise and fall of mighty empires for hundreds of years, from the tip of a rocky peninsula jutting into the sea. These days, however, it is home to the public library and Corfu's archives.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> With distinctive markings on their shells, western box turtles, such as the one seen here, are among the most widely recognized turtle species and one of two box turtle species in the US. Box turtles are named after their dome-shaped shells which are hinged at the bottom, allowing the shell to close like a box if it needs to hide from predators. They generally live for around 25 years but can survive for more than 50, and there have been reports of some living for 100 years.
> 
> Some turtles may have existed more than 100 million years ago but while they outlived the dinosaurs, more than half of all turtle and tortoise species are now on the verge of extinction. Today is World Turtle Day, an event set up to celebrate these incredible creatures and highlight their disappearing habitats.

<summary>Description</summary>

> It’s International Day for Biological Diversity, a day to celebrate the variety of life on Earth in all its forms, from bacteria, plants, and animals to entire ecosystems like coral reefs and rainforests. All living things within each ecosystem are interconnected, and we rely on healthy ecosystems for our water, food, medicines, clothes, energy, and shelter. But many species are threatened with extinction and ecosystems are being destroyed, which mean Earth’s rich biodiversity is in decline.
> 
> Our homepage image shows Costa Rica’s Monteverde Cloud Forest, home to about half of all species in the country, including more than 2,500 types of plants and 400 bird species. Here you’ll find jaguars and pumas living alongside sloths, howler monkeys, and the endangered resplendent quetzal. This forest alone represents about 2.5% of the world’s biodiversity, the perfect ambassador for today’s event, which calls on us to rethink our relationship with nature and work to be better stewards of the Earth.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to Paris, France’s ancient capital city, through which flows one of the country’s longest rivers, the Seine. Human habitation here dates back to at least the 3rd century BCE, when a Gallic tribe called the Parisii settled on an island in the middle of the river. Today, that island is known as the Île de la Cité, seen on the left of our photo, and is home to Notre-Dame cathedral, as well as other striking buildings such as the medieval Conciergerie, pictured here.
> 
> It is linked to the Place de l'Hôtel-de-Ville by the Pont d’Arcole, one of 37 bridges connecting the city’s left and right banks. The Pont d’Arcole was built in the 1850s and holds a special place in Parisiennes’ hearts. In 1944, it supported General Jacques-Philippe Leclerc's tanks on their way to liberate Paris.
