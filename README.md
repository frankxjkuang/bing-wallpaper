> These giants are the largest land animals on Earth, African bush elephants, which can reach 13 feet in shoulder height and weigh as much as 11 tons. They are one of three living species of elephant, alongside their smaller relatives, the African forest elephant and the Asian elephant. Their immense size is not the only incredible thing about them. Studies suggest that elephants can recognize themselves in the mirror and that these mammals display emotions such as grief when they lose family members. World Elephant Day—held on August 12—was set up to admire them but also to highlight the difficulties they face. Amboseli National Park in Kenya—where this photograph was taken—is one of the few remaining habitats where African elephant herds can still be found in large numbers.

> It might look futuristic, but this stunning pool was created a few years ago at the Jupiter Artland sculpture garden near Edinburgh, for the Scottish city's annual art festival. Nearly 30 feet wide, 'Gateway' is both a landscape sculpture and a functioning swimming pool. It was made by the artist Joana Vasconcelos from over 11,000 hand-painted tiles, produced in a traditional ceramic workshop in Portugal.

> Today is the first day of this year's Edinburgh Art Festival, which runs for two weeks and features events and exhibitions by both established artists and emerging talents. August is festival season in Scotland's capital city, which is also hosting its international festival, the famous Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo, and the city's international book and film festivals.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Lions are known as 'the king of the jungle,' but on World Lion Day, let's set the record straight: Lions don't live in the jungle. Lions lounge in lordly leisure and hunt with ferocious focus on grasslands and plains. When they're not hunting, these majestic creatures nap, wrestle, and groom each other. But in an instant, they're chasing down a hapless gazelle or a hippopotamus that's wandered too far from the safety of its river. Like the opening song of 'The Lion King' movie says, it's the circle of life. World Lion Day is our opportunity to (ahem) lionize these regal beasts and raise awareness of threats to their well-being like poaching, habitat destruction, and other human-lion conflicts.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Earth is home to an estimated 476 million Indigenous people, a term meaning 'sprung from the land' or native, which refers to the descendants of an area's first-known inhabitants. They represent about 6% of the global population but speak more than half of the world's estimated 7,000 languages. Our homepage today showcases the art of the Tiwi people of Australia, who speak a unique language unlinked to another other known language, in their community of only 2,000 people. Colonization has long impacted Indigenous people, contributing to high rates of poverty and loss of language and traditional lands. The UN first held the International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples in 1994, and every August 9 they bring attention to the fight to preserve the rights, dignity, and existence of the world's oldest cultures.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This looping highway in Taipei bears a resemblance to the symbol of infinity—the concept of something without ends or limits that is celebrated today. Infinity Day is held on the eighth day of the eighth month, a nod to the symbol's likeness to a sideways figure-of-eight. Established in 1987 by a New York-based philosopher, Jean-Pierre Ady Fenyo, the day celebrates freedom of thinking in its various forms, from philosophy through the arts and sciences. The symbol itself has a much longer history. English mathematician John Wallis is credited with introducing it as a mathematical symbol in 1655. The philosophical concept of infinity dates back at least as far as ancient Greece.

> Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, was founded in the 18th century. The city might seem remote due to its location at the northern tip of the island, but Taipei's industrial activity encouraged the construction of impressive highways and public transport systems. Its green areas and nature preserves are equally remarkable, creating an extraordinary aerial view of the parks and roads in surprising shapes.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Happy National Lighthouse Day! A beacon, a warning, and a symbol of hope and home, lighthouses have existed for thousands of years. The earliest known was the Pharos of Alexandria, which stood an estimated 330 feet tall. Built by the ancient Egyptians in the 3rd century BCE, an open fire was lit at its highest part to guide ships into port. Illumination technology advanced over the centuries, culminating in today's electric versions beaming light that can be seen from over 20 miles away. North Carolina's Bodie Island Lighthouse, pictured here, was built in 1872 and overlooks a section of ocean once known as the Graveyard of the Atlantic. Since then, it's been doing its best to outshine the stars above, as it guides sailors home to safe harbor.

Surrounded by lush greenery and the Togakushi Mountain Range in Nagano Prefecture, Kagami-ike emerges from the morning mists to create an enchanting spectacle. During the cherry blossom season, visitors walk among sakura petals that float along the breeze while, in autumn, they can enjoy its surrounding orange and yellow foliage. This secluded spot is a wonderfully peaceful place for mindful meditation and self-reflection.

When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
