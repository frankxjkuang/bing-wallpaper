<summary>Description</summary>

> Today's image features a black caiman, South America's stealthy river giant, in the Tambopata National Reserve of Peru. These caimans are the largest species in the alligator family, growing up to 20 feet and weighing as much as 1,000 pounds. Their dark color helps them blend into the murky depths. These carnivorous creatures thrive in freshwater environments such as slow-moving rivers, lakes, and seasonally flooded savannas. From these waters, they hunt for birds, fish, turtles, and occasionally big mammals. Black caimans play an important role in making sure ecosystems stay balanced by keeping the populations of their prey under control. More caimans mean fewer piranhas, which attack cattle, and fewer capybaras, which can cause crop damage.

> Welcome to this eco-travelers' paradise in the middle of the Pacific. Situated halfway between Hawaii and American Samoa, the Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge was established in 2001 to conserve, manage, and restore the nation's fish, wildlife, plants, and habitats.
> 
> Home to a vast reef system, this atoll has three shallow lagoons, and numerous sandy and reef-rock islets with vegetation like coconut palms, Scaevola, and towering Pisonia trees. But wait, there's more. The lush greenery here is a bustling neighborhood that is home to over a million birds from 29 different species, like masked booby, great frigatebird, and sooty tern. It is also one of the few places outside the Galápagos Islands where red-footed boobies are found. There is a huge variety of marine wildlife in and around the atoll, including green sea turtles, hawksbill turtles, and the mighty coconut crab, the world's largest land invertebrate.

> Join us as we celebrate the American wilderness on National Park Service Founders Day. Today we honor the foresight of visionaries who spearheaded the creation of the NPS. This organization was established by President Woodrow Wilson to conserve wildlife, maintain natural landscapes, preserve historical artifacts, and offer educational programs. You can enjoy this day by visiting one of 429 national parks in the country and diving into ranger-led programs, volunteer efforts, and celebratory events to learn more about the history.
> 
> If you're in Montana, you can explore Glacier National Park, which was established in 1910. Glacier has more than 700 lakes, two mountain ranges, and vast forests teeming with life, which earned it the moniker 'Crown of the Continent.' With its 25 glaciers, it is a vital study ground for scientists monitoring climate change. Spread across approximately 1,013,000 acres, the park protects animals such as grizzly bears, moose, elks, and mountain goats. Glacier National Park also houses the Going-to-the-Sun Road, over 700 miles of trails, and the awe-inspiring vistas of Swiftcurrent Lake, seen in today's image.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to Katahdin, where dense woodlands and pristine waterways stretch out as far as the eye can see. Covering nearly 87,500 acres, this new national monument was established eight years ago today. Maine's logging industry was a big part of this region for over a hundred years but declined toward the end of the 19th century. Efforts to preserve its landscape were spearheaded by philanthropist Roxanne Quimby. She started buying land near Baxter State Park in 2001 and donated it to the federal government in 2016, ensuring its preservation for future generations.
> 
> Katahdin Woods and Waters' diverse ecosystem is home to many animals, including moose, black bear, Canada lynx, and bald eagles. Hiking, canoeing, and camping are among popular activities, and it has some of the darkest skies in the country, making it a great place for stargazing.

> Today, let us step into the Phanom Rung Historical Park in Buriram province, Thailand. Here, Khmer architecture and history come to life. Built between the 10th and 13th centuries, this remarkable site served as a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Shiva. It is on the rim of an extinct volcano, offering views of the surrounding paddy fields and the towering Dongrek Mountains of Cambodia in the distance.
> 
> With its earthen terraces, the 500-foot promenade leading up to the main gate is one of the most striking features in the park. A long passage lined with sandstone pillars, it leads to the first of three bridges symbolizing the transition from the mortal realm to the divine. At the top, the shrine showcases a wealth of religious motifs, including Hindu sculptures. The annual festival of Phanom Rung, held in April, attracts many who gather to witness the sun's rays aligning with the 15 doorways of the temple and lighting up the inner sanctum.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> The Galápagos Islands in the eastern Pacific are a paradise for wildlife. Habitats range from arid regions to tropical rainforests. Because these islands are so isolated, many of the species that live here are not found anywhere else in the world. One species found in abundance is the Nazca booby, pictured here on Wolf Island. The name might raise a few eyebrows, but it actually comes from the Spanish word 'bobo,' meaning clown, because of the birds' clumsy demeanor when they're walking.
> 
> The Galápagos archipelago, including the remote and rugged outpost of Wolf Island, provides an ideal habitat for these seabirds. The island's steep cliffs and rocky shores offer perfect nesting sites, while the surrounding waters teem with fish, providing ample food. Visiting the Galápagos offers an incredible opportunity to see these birds in their natural habitat, along with the chance to explore one of the most biodiverse regions on the planet.
