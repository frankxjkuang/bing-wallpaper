> Few sights capture the spirit of the Alps like the Matterhorn mirrored in Lake Stellisee's glassy waters. Rising 14,692 feet on the Swiss-Italian border, this legendary peak has long symbolized natural beauty and adventure, drawing climbers, hikers, and dreamers from every corner of the globe.
> 
> From Zermatt—a charming, car-free village in Switzerland—the Matterhorn dominates the horizon, its jagged silhouette etched against the sky like a work of art. At Lake Stellisee, the view turns magical, especially at sunrise when the mountain's reflection glows softly on the mirrorlike surface. It feels as though time stands still, as if nature paused just for you to savor the moment.
> 
> Whether you're trekking alpine trails, photographing the shifting light, or simply breathing in crisp mountain air, this scene offers a quiet reminder of why the Alps have inspired travelers for centuries. The Matterhorn isn't just a mountain; it's a reflection of everything that makes Switzerland unforgettable.

> Step into the realm of giants. Try embracing a BFG (Big Friendly Giant) as you wrap your arms around a thousand years of wisdom in a single tree trunk. Welcome to Muir Woods National Monument—established on this day in 1908—a majestic hall of coastal redwoods just north of San Francisco. These towering redwoods are the tallest trees on Earth—one here stretches about 258 feet, roughly the height of 43 people stacked head to toe. Most are 600–800 years old, and some have stood for over a millennium, yet they're still considered 'young' for a species that can live for 2,000 years.
> 
> How do they endure? Thick, fire-resistant bark and tannins ward off insects and disease, while their roots—though only 10 to 13 feet deep—spread outward up to 100 feet and interlock with neighbors for stability. Fog drifting in from the Pacific provides nearly 40% of their water during dry summers, and fallen trees recycle nutrients as 'nurse logs,' fueling new life. As you enter this forest, bow to the trees that rise beyond life itself. Your footsteps ripple through the river of time, flowing toward the future these giants patiently await.

> When a bird is called a starling, you'd expect it to be a bit of a show-off. True to its name, this little creature knows how to steal the spotlight. From shimmering feathers that glint green and purple in the sun, to its ability to mimic sounds, the starling is the headline act. Originally native to Europe and Asia, the common starling has spread across the globe. In the 19th century, a group of them were introduced to New York's Central Park by an enthusiast of birds mentioned in Shakespeare's plays.
> 
> Brighton's West Pier may be a ruin, but when starlings gather above it, the scene is anything but broken. Each evening in autumn and winter, thousands of these small birds twist and turn in the air. The spectacle is called a murmuration, a term as musical as the sound of wings beating in unison. Scientists suggest the birds swoop and swirl to confuse predators, keep warm and share information about roosting spots. Whatever the reason, the result is a dance that has visitors gazing upward, phones in hand, hoping to catch a glimpse before the flock settles for the night.

> Today is a day that puts time into perspective. Old Rock Day highlights the vast geological processes that have shaped our world since its earliest eras. In Arches National Park, Utah, Turret Arch—seen through North Window—offers a striking reminder: landscapes can take hundreds of millions of years to assemble. The Entrada Sandstone that forms these arches began as shifting dunes and shallow seas long before erosion carved today's shapes. Even so, these formations are relatively young. Most rocks on Earth disappear over time because plate tectonics, erosion, and volcanism continually recycle the crust. Only the planet's ancient continental shields preserve truly old material. Canada's Acasta Gneiss, about 4 billion years old, is the oldest known rock still rooted where it formed.
> 
> Old Rock Day also remembers the pioneers of geology. Theophrastus and Pliny the Elder recorded early mineral studies, while Ulisse Aldrovandi helped establish the term 'geology' in 1603. One hundred fifty years later, William Smith drew the first geological map. And in 1785, James Hutton revealed the Earth's immense age, providing insights that continue to shape our understanding of the ground beneath our feet.

> Picture a city where your daily commute offers views of fjords, drifting ice, and the Northern Lights. That's everyday life in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland—a small yet spirited Arctic hub blending Inuit heritage with Nordic modernity. Founded in 1728 by Danish-Norwegian missionary Hans Egede, it began as a small settlement called Godthaab—'Good Hope.'
> 
> Nuuk preserves 18th-century landmarks like the Hans Egede House and the red wooden Nuuk Cathedral. The Greenland National Museum displays Inuit artifacts and the well-preserved Qilakitsoq mummies, offering a glimpse into the island's deep past. This city is also home to the world's only Arctic golf course. But it's not just the sights that define Nuuk—it's how people come together when the cold sets in.
> 
> Winter brings short days and snowfall, yet the city buzzes with life. People head out for cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, boating, or dog sledding along the fjords. Indoors, friends gather for 'kaffemik'—a cozy coffee-and-cake tradition with strong Greenlandic coffee topped with whipped cream. Nuuk shows that life in the cold isn't about endurance—it's about balance, community, and finding color even in the depths of winter.

<summary>Description</summary>

> What stands out about Londolozi Game Reserve in South Africa isn't just the wildlife—it's the long-term commitment behind it. Since 1926, its 58 square miles have supported research and monitored wildlife behavior in their natural habitat. Located within the Sabi Sand Private Game Reserve, it is home to Africa's Big Five. Londolozi is part of a larger open system that connects with Kruger National Park, allowing animals such as elephants, rhinos, lions, leopards, zebras, and many antelope species to move freely without fences holding them back.
> 
> Among the species frequently spotted are impalas—always moving, always alert. Their adaptable feeding habits help them shift between flowering plants, acacia pods, forbs, and fruits as the seasons change. Their social structure is just as interesting: females and young gather in herds, while males compete for territories during the breeding season. Most young are born in early summer after a gestation period of six to seven months. Even though they're quick and agile, predators such as leopards, lions, and cheetahs keep them on edge. Drought cycles and habitat pressure add to the challenges, so protected spaces like Londolozi make a meaningful difference in their long-term survival.

> Kings Mountain in Alaska's Chugach Mountains isn't just another bump on the horizon—it's the kind of rugged beauty that makes you slow down and stare. Rising over 5,800 feet and sitting roughly 22 miles northeast of Palmer, this peak towers over mile 75 of the Glenn Highway, a route famous for its dramatic scenery. Its slopes bear the marks of ancient glaciers, etched into ridges and valleys that seem tailor-made for adventure.
> 
> The Dena'ina name, Bashtl'ech' (black stone), speaks to its cultural roots, while its English name honors Al King, a prospector from Alaska's gold rush days. Today, hikers and climbers come for the challenge: steep ascents, unpredictable weather, and views so sweeping they feel like a hard-earned reward. On clear days, the Matanuska Glacier glimmers in the distance, and wildflowers brighten the rocky terrain, reminding you that even Alaska's wilderness has a soft side. Pack layers and a sense of humor—the weather changes fast—but if you're lucky, standing atop Kings Mountain feels like shaking hands with the sky.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
