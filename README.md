<summary>Description</summary>

> In the heart of Paris stands one of the city's most enduring icons: Notre-Dame Cathedral. Built between the 12th and 13th centuries on the Île de la Cité—an island in the Seine—Notre-Dame has witnessed centuries of French history, from the Hundred Years' War to the French Revolution, and beyond. Although it was chosen by Napoleon as the site of his coronation as emperor in 1804, by the early 19th century, the cathedral was in a state of disrepair. However, one novel changed its fortunes: 'The Hunchback of Notre-Dame' by Victor Hugo, published in 1831. The popularity of this book helped encourage a restoration project that renewed the cathedral's former beauty.
> 
> In April 2019, tragedy struck—a fire broke out in the roof space of Notre-Dame. By the time the blaze was extinguished, the cathedral's wooden spire had been destroyed, along with most of the roof, and there was extensive damage to the tops of the building's walls. Reconstruction efforts have been underway over the last five years , and today, Notre-Dame will reopen to the public. Finally, visitors will once again be able to marvel at the medieval majesty of this beautiful cathedral.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today, the country remembers 'a date which will live in infamy.' President Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke these words to Congress in 1941, the day after Japan's attack on the Pearl Harbor naval base in Oahu, Hawaii. The destruction inflicted on the US Pacific Fleet is one of military history's most devastating surprise attacks. More than 3,500 US servicepeople were killed or wounded, and eight battleships were destroyed or damaged in less than two hours. Following Roosevelt's speech came a declaration of war and the entrance of the US into World War II. Congress named December 7 National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day in 1994.
> 
> The Pearl Harbor National Memorial holds an annual observance, but other places have also commemorated the event. Today's image is of the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge in New Haven, Connecticut. Locally known as the Q Bridge, it carries the I-95 over the mouth of the Quinnipiac River. In 1995, this innovative bridge replaced an older one and was renamed. With cannons of light that shoot up to the sky and a red, white, and blue lighting scheme on patriotic holidays, the Q Bridge is a poignant reminder of a dark chapter in the nation's history.

> Happy Independence Day, Finland! On this day in 1917, the Nordic nation declared its independence from Russia. Finland had been a grand duchy of the Russian Empire since 1809, and it was part of the Swedish Empire for the previous 600 years. However, during the Russian revolutions of 1917, Finnish nationalists saw their chance to establish an independent nation. After several months of negotiations, Finland declared independence on December 6.
> 
> Independence Day celebrations officially begin when the Finnish flag is raised on Tähtitorninmäki (Observatory Hill) in Helsinki. People across the country place two blue-and-white candles in their windows, a tradition dating back to the 19th century when two candles were a symbol of Finnish nationalism. In university towns, students take to the streets for torchlit processions. The day's celebrations culminate at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki. It's here that Linnan juhlat (the Castle Ball) takes place. This special gala is broadcast live and watched by millions across the country.

> Shaped by the slow passage of time, tufa—a type of porous limestone—emerges as one of nature's most spectacular formations. While these towers can be found in many places, today's image shows some at Mono Lake in Mono County, California. These structures develop when calcium-rich fresh water, flowing into the lake from several creeks and streams, mixes with the lake's alkaline water. Over centuries, this interaction caused calcium carbonate to build up, forming tufa spires above the lake's surface. To preserve the tufa towers, the Mono Lake Tufa State Natural Reserve was established in 1981.
> 
> Mono Lake is a fascinating desert lake with hypersaline and alkaline waters and no natural outlet. It supports a thriving ecosystem teeming with billions of brine shrimp and alkali flies. These tiny creatures are essential snacks for a variety of migratory birds, like California gulls and eared grebes. As a food source, Mono Lake is a critical pit stop along the Pacific Flyway, a major migration route for birds journeying from Alaska all the way south to Patagonia.

> It's Wildlife Conservation Day—an important reminder to celebrate and defend our planet's incredible biodiversity. Many species face extinction, including African forest elephants, Cross River gorillas, and Yangtze finless porpoises. Since its launch in 2012, this special day has highlighted illegal wildlife trade and other threats that animals face. It also draws attention to the need for stronger long-term solutions.
> 
> The journey of the white rhinoceros, featured in today's image, illustrates the importance of conservation efforts. They have two subspecies: the near-threatened southern white rhinoceros and the critically endangered northern white rhinoceros. In the late 19th century, the southern white rhino, found in South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, and Kenya, was on the brink of extinction due to relentless poaching for their horns. But thanks to more than a century of dedicated management, their numbers have bounced back significantly. Unfortunately, the northern white rhino is in a precarious situation, with only two left—a mother and daughter. They're now under protection at Kenya's Ol Pejeta Conservancy.

> Grand palaces and towering forts shape the landscape of the Indian state of Rajasthan. Among the most prominent is Amber Fort, also known as Amer Fort or Amber Palace, which is perched on a small hill about 7 miles from the main city of Jaipur. Within its regal walls lies the Sattais Katcheri, which means 'court of 27 pillars,' featured in today's image. Amber Fort was built in 1592 and it served as the residence of the maharajas, or rulers, of the area. Famous for its unique blend of Hindu, Rajput, and Mughal architectural styles, it is constructed from pale yellow and pink sandstone alongside white marble. This masterpiece is spread across four levels, each with its own courtyard. Part of the wider Hill Forts of Rajasthan UNESCO World Heritage Site, Amber Fort invites visitors to explore a rich blend of history and royalty.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Have you ever experienced the awe of seeing an Alaskan moose? The largest moose species, these creatures can weigh 1,400 pounds and reach heights of up to 6 feet at the shoulder. Male moose are called bulls, females are known as cows, and their young are referred to as calves. One thing that really sets moose apart is their incredible antlers, which are only sported by the males.
> 
> Pictured here is a cow in Denali National Park, where around 1,800 moose roam the forested areas near lakes and marshes north of the Alaska Range. Denali's largest herbivores, these mammals feast on willow, birch, and aspen twigs during the winter. When summer rolls around, they enjoy a diverse diet of flowering plants, pond vegetation, and deciduous leaves. While moose aren't usually aggressive, they can turn hostile if bothered by people, dogs, or traffic—especially when they're tired or hungry in winter, struggling through deep snow. Bull moose may also become quite aggressive during mating season in autumn and winter. So, best to admire these giants from a safe distance!

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
