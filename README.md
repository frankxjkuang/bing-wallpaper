> Get your telescope and star map app ready because it's Astronomy Day! Doug Berger, then president of the Astronomical Association of Northern California, created Astronomy Day in 1973 to get more people interested in the wonders of space. He set up telescopes on street corners, malls, and parks to give people a chance to see the stars firsthand.
> 
> Early astronomers lacked the means to view celestial objects beyond those which could be seen by the naked eye. But they still made major discoveries, such as calculating the size and distance of the moon, affirming the sun as the center of our solar system, and predicting the movement of stars relative to the seasons. Today we have sophisticated telescopes, from the orbiting James Webb Space Telescope to the portable ones you'll find in use at International Dark Sky Parks, including Joshua Tree National Park, seen in our photo. With such ground-breaking technology at our disposal, astronomers can boldly go where no human eyes have gone before.

<summary>Description</summary>

> We're celebrating Arbor Day with some of Yosemite's most famous residents, the giant sequoia trees of Mariposa Grove. The day champions the planting and preservation of trees and can trace its roots back more than 150 years. In 1872, Nebraska City News editor Julius Sterling Morton proposed a day for locals to plant trees, and the idea grew and grew. Today all 50 states celebrate Arbor Day, most commonly on the last Friday in April, although different states might observe it on the best dates for tree planting in their area.
> 
> Giant sequoias, like the ones on our homepage, have been around for a very long time. Geological evidence suggests that they are the third-longest-lived tree species in the world. There are hundreds of them in Yosemite's Mariposa Grove, including the famous Grizzly Giant, which is estimated to be about 3,000 years old. Let's hope it is around for thousands of Arbor Days to come.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Located a few miles offshore on the Texas Gulf Coast, Padre Island is the largest of the state's string of barrier islands. At 113 miles in length, it is also the longest barrier island in the world. Barrier islands usually run parallel to the coast and, as the name suggests, serve as the mainland's first line of defense against storms.
> 
> Since the Port Mansfield Channel was built in the early 1960s, Padre Island has been split into two parts, South Padre Island, pictured here, and North Padre Island. Connected by a bridge to the shore, the resort town of South Padre Island draws in thousands of visitors every year for swimming, boating, fishing, or simply lounging on the beach. Others come for the trail of elaborate sandcastles scattered across the island, created by professional artists.

> These little furballs will grow up to be great horned owls, fierce predators with camouflage coloring. For now, they sport a layer of fluffy light-colored down and have yet to grow their full 'horns'—tufts of feathers known as plumicorns. But they will become voracious carnivores capable of hunting down prey larger than themselves, including other owls. Typical meals will consist of small animals like rabbits, squirrels, mice, and even scorpions.
> 
> They spend their days roosting and their nights hunting alone. Great horned owls don't migrate but often move from one territory to another. These distinctive birds can be found almost anywhere in the Americas, from sub-Arctic regions to the tropics. You might even find them in your own backyard!

> Native to the land and surrounding waters of Antarctica, Adélie penguins migrate an average of 8,000 miles annually, as they follow the sun from their breeding colonies to winter foraging grounds and back again. The species is easy to recognize by the white rings around their eyes. Oh, and if you think you were chilly this winter, these birds thrive in temperatures as low as -20 degrees Fahrenheit.

> This mysterious door can be found in the woods in Germany's largest state, Bavaria, known for its stunning castles, mountains, and forests. The home of Oktoberfest, it also has a worldwide reputation for its beer and its northern region of Franconia, where our picture was taken, is a premier wine destination. This little door leads to an underground cellar near the village of Pünzendorf, and its naturally low temperature once made it an ideal place to store the beer and wine the area is famous for. These days, you might be more likely to find bats inside, so perhaps it's better admired from a distance.

> 'There is no friend as loyal as a book,' Ernest Hemingway once wrote. On World Book Day, we are honoring these loyal friends in the German city of Stuttgart, where a huge monolithic cube is both a modern landmark and home to the city library. Opened in 2011, this striking building was designed by architect Eun Young Yi to be a calming, meditative space in a bustling city. Its interior is white, with splashes of color provided by the books that line its walls.
