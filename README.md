<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to the year 2152. That is, in the Tibetan calendar at least. Today marks the start of Losar, the new year festival celebrated in Tibetan Buddhism, which is observed in Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal, and parts of India. Losar celebrations run for 15 days, beginning the night before with a meal of guthuk—a traditional dumpling soup. The new year is rung in with an incense burning ceremony and visits to holy places to pray for good fortune in the year ahead.
> 
> Today's image takes us to Paro Taktsang, also known as the Tiger's Nest, a Buddhist monastery and holy site perched 10,000 feet above sea level in Bhutan. Built around the Taktsang Senge Samdup cave in 1692, it is where Guru Padmasambhava, who introduced Vajrayana Buddhism to Bhutan, meditated and taught his students. Paro Taktsang is made up of four main temples, all connected by stairways cut into the cliff face, as well as a handful of rickety bridges. In Bhutan, Losar is celebrated with picnics, dancing, darts, and the country's national sport: archery.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we're heading north for International Polar Bear Day. This event is the perfect time to learn more about the world's largest bear species and the threats they face. Polar bears are native to the Arctic and can be found in Alaska, Russia, Greenland, and Svalbard. They're also found in Canada—like the cub in today's image, photographed in Churchill, Manitoba.
> 
> Polar bears spend over half of their time hunting for seals on the sea ice, although they usually catch just one or two for every 10 that they try to catch. Their reliance on sea ice for hunting means that they are highly vulnerable to climate change. Sea ice is rapidly disappearing as the planet heats up, and polar bears are at risk of malnutrition and starvation as their hunting grounds vanish. Shrinking ice sheets also mean that these bears have to swim farther to find food, which depletes their energy reserves. International Polar Bear Day is the perfect opportunity to reflect on how we can reduce our carbon footprints and contribute to the conservation of these amazing predators.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Perched dramatically on a tidal islet in Loch Laich, Argyll, Castle Stalker is one of Scotland's most picturesque and well-preserved medieval tower houses. Built around the 1440s by the Stewarts of Appin, its history includes royal visits and even a drunken wager that briefly transferred ownership to Clan Campbell. After falling into disrepair by the 19th century, it was lovingly restored in the mid-20th century and is still privately owned today. Visitors can explore this historic site on selected guided tours during the summer.
> 
> Its name, 'Stalker,' comes from the Scottish Gaelic 'Stalcaire,' meaning 'hunter' or 'falconer.' And while its striking appearance is certainly memorable, its fame may actually stem from another reason: Castle Stalker has captured imaginations in popular culture, appearing in 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' and the 'Black Mirror' episode 'Loch Henry.' Does it ring a bell now? Nestled in the scenic Lynn of Lorn National Scenic Area, it's an enduring symbol of Scotland's storied past.

> A breathtaking maze of sandstone formations and awe-inspiring views awaits you at Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah. People have lived in this area for at least 10,000 years, including the Anasazi, Pueblo, and Paiute Peoples. The hoodoos—tall, thin spires of rock formed by erosion—in the park inspired Paiute mythology: they believed them to be the Legend People turned to stone by the trickster Coyote.
> 
> The first European Americans arrived in the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and some eventually settled there in the 1850s. Bryce Canyon was named after Ebenezer Bryce, who had a homestead nearby. On this date in 1928, it was declared a national park. These days, the park is famous for its hoodoos. Every year, over 2 million visitors come to marvel at these geological formations. In fact, Bryce Canyon National Park has the highest concentration of hoodoos anywhere on Earth.

> Prepare to be amazed by the giant cuttlefish, known for its mesmerizing ability to transform its appearance in the blink of an eye. This cuttlefish is found in the temperate and subtropical waters of Australia, ranging from Brisbane in Queensland and Shark Bay in Western Australia to as far south as Tasmania.
> 
> Featured here is a group of giant cuttlefish off the coast near Whyalla, South Australia. This species holds the title of being the largest of its kind on Earth. It can reach an impressive mantle length of 20 inches and stretches up to a total length of 40 inches when its tentacles are fully extended. Weighing nearly 25 pounds, this marine heavyweight is as fascinating as it is formidable. Like all cuttlefish, this species has eight arms, two feeding tentacles, three hearts, and blue blood. However, its most spectacular feature is its skin, which is equipped with chromatophores—specialized cells that allow it to change colors and patterns.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Around 60 miles southwest of Tokyo stands one of Japan's cultural icons: Mount Fuji. The country's tallest mountain rises 12,000 feet above the surrounding landscape, with its near-symmetrical cone covered in snow for nearly five months each year. For centuries, Fujisan—as it is known in Japanese—has been worshiped as a sacred mountain. In the Shinto faith, Fuji is deified as Asama no Okami, and shrines dedicated to it are built within sight of the mountain.
> 
> February 23 is celebrated as Mount Fuji Day (富士山の日) because the word 'Fujisan' can be interpreted as '2, 2, 3.' Although it's not a national holiday, people often take the opportunity to learn more about this majestic peak. It's also a day to reflect on the future of the mountain, and how it can be preserved for future generations. Every year, more than 300,000 people climb Mount Fuji, and overtourism has become a real concern.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we are celebrating the anniversary of Gateway National Park, which was established on February 22, 2018, in St. Louis, Missouri. The park, which lies along a picturesque stretch of the Mississippi River, commemorates Thomas Jefferson’s idea of a continental nation. At its heart stands the Gateway Arch, a breathtaking 630-foot-tall structure that has become the ultimate symbol of St. Louis. Constructed of stainless steel, it holds the distinction of being the world's tallest arch and Missouri's tallest accessible structure. Finnish American architect Eero Saarinen dreamed up the design back in 1947, and by October 28, 1965, his vision had been brought to life. The arch's futuristic design has long been viewed as a symbol of the automobile era, representing the modern, urban landscape, and the promise of a technologically advanced future.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
