<summary>Description</summary>

> Rock layers formed over millions of years and a massive bend in the Earth's crust give this desert a rare window into geologic history. This is Capitol Reef National Park in Utah, where sandstone cliffs and canyons preserve a striking record of the planet's past. December 18 marks the anniversary of its designation as a national park in 1971. Today's featured image highlights the sandstone monoliths of Cathedral Valley, including the Temple of the Sun, part of this extraordinary, protected landscape.
> 
> Capitol Reef takes its name from two defining features: rounded Navajo sandstone domes—within the Waterpocket Fold—that resemble the US Capitol building, and the Fold's ridges that form a 'reef,' which blocked early travel across the desert. Before becoming a national park, the area was designated as a national monument in 1937.
> 
> This anniversary also honors the human history linked to this region. Indigenous communities lived along the Fremont River long before pioneer orchards appeared, leaving petroglyphs carved into canyon walls.

> Who could resist that squishy face? A Eurasian red squirrel perches on a snowy pine branch, paws clutching a pine cone like it's the last snack on Earth. These little acrobats stay busy collecting nuts, seeds, and fungi—feasting on fresh finds in summer and on stored cones through winter.
> 
> Once common across Britain, their numbers have fallen sharply due to competition from gray squirrels and the spread of the squirrelpox virus. Today, these red squirrels are mostly found in northern England and Scotland, with refuges like Kielder and Harwood Forests in Northumberland helping sustain their populations.
> 
> Their bright fur and quick movements have made them favorites in art and children's tales—most famously in Beatrix Potter's 'The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin.' Spotting a red squirrel in the wild feels like seeing a classic winter illustration come to life—tiny paws, a twitching nose, and a tail that seems to have a mind of its own. So the next time you see one, remember that protecting small creatures helps keep the stories they inspire alive.

> They've got long beards, red hats, and a knack for stealing a tad bit of Santa's thunder every Christmas. Meet the gnome—known as 'tomte' in Sweden and 'nisse' in Norway—whose traditions vary across regions. Rooted in Scandinavian folklore, these tiny guardians watch over homes and farms, keeping families safe through long, dark winters. But there's a catch: treat them kindly, or they may play tricks. A warm bowl of porridge on Christmas Eve is their favorite reward. Said to bring luck and laughter, they might even befriend your garden gnomes, since they often resemble them.
> 
> Gnomes are also believed to possess deep knowledge of nature and the secrets of the earth, which explains their role as loyal protectors. Over time, these helpers have swapped their work clothes for red hats and festive charm, evolving into the Christmas gnomes we know today. Handmade with wool, felt, and faux fur, they now fill Christmas markets with color and character. Look closely and you'll notice no two are the same—some mischievous, others sweet, all with stories woven into every seam. So, the next time one catches your eye at a Christmas market, take it as a quiet offer of protection.

> Have you ever wondered how canals changed the way cities developed? For thousands of years, people have built canals to transport goods, control water flow, and connect places. From ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt to medieval Europe, they transformed cities like Venice and Bruges into trade hubs. The Netherlands took this even further—by the 17th century, they were designing waterways that shaped cities such as Amsterdam.
> 
> It's no wonder Amsterdam is nicknamed the 'Venice of the North.' The city's 60-mile-long network of canals forms part of the UNESCO-listed Canal District. Mostly flanked by roads on both sides, these routes are now used for tourism and recreation. In the center of the city is the Spiegelgracht canal seen in today's image. It is famous for its art galleries, antique shops, and serene reflections that inspired its name, 'Mirror Canal.' As night falls, bridges and trees glow with festive lights, their reflections shimmering across the calm water. With Christmas just around the corner, these canals resemble glowing strings of history—proof that the past still shines bright in the present.

> Each December, thousands swap wrapping paper for binoculars and step outside for a different kind of holiday tradition: the Audubon Christmas Bird Count. Instead of hunting for bargains, they hunt for birds—with pencils, rather than pellets. Started in 1900 by ornithologist Frank M. Chapman, the count offered a peaceful alternative to the Christmas 'side hunts,' where people competed to shoot the most animals. Chapman had a better idea: count them instead. Over a century later, that simple shift has grown into the world's longest-running citizen-science project.
> 
> Between December 14 and January 5, volunteers across the Americas head into designated 15-mile circles to tally every bird they see or hear. From bustling cities to remote forests, participants—known affectionately as 'birders'—log species like chickadees, hawks, and tufted titmice (seen in today's image). The data helps scientists track long-term trends in bird populations, migration patterns, and climate impacts. So this holiday season, if you hear people chirping about Christmas counts, don't assume they're talking calories.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Every masterpiece needs a brushstroke to tie it together. For Yosemite National Park, that stroke is the Merced River—painting reflections of granite cliffs, pine forests, and waterfalls across its canvas. One of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers, this waterway begins high in the Sierra Nevada. It gathers meltwater and winds 145 miles west through Yosemite Valley into California's Central Valley.
> 
> Its Spanish name, 'El Río de Nuestra Señora de la Merced,' translates to 'River of Our Lady of Mercy,' and suits it well: it offers both calm and chaos depending on the season. Spring turns the river into Yosemite's main act, as snowmelt sends torrents rushing beneath stone bridges and past roaring waterfalls like Vernal and Nevada Falls. Summer brings a gentler flow that attracts rafters and swimmers. Fall adds a hint of gold as leaves drift downstream, and winter slows everything to a reflective stillness. Interestingly, it feeds Lake McClure, where a ghost town rises when water levels drop in fall and winter. Along its lower stretches once stood Merced Falls, a bustling mill town during the Gold Rush era, now lying quiet.

> Some plants simply sit quietly on windowsills. The poinsettia? It demands the spotlight. Bright, bold, and as red as Rudolph's nose, this December diva even has its own holiday—National Poinsettia Day, celebrated on December 12. Prior to becoming a popular Christmas decoration, this shrub had quite a journey. Long before it appeared in living rooms, it grew wild in Mexico, where the Aztecs used it for dyes and medicine. Then, in the 1820s, US diplomat Joel Roberts Poinsett spotted the plant, fell for its charm, and sent it home. The rest, as they say, is history—and botany.
> 
> Despite its festive fame, the poinsettia still has to fight off some myths. The biggest one? That it's poisonous. It won't make you feel great if you eat one (and your cat won't thank you either), but it's far from deadly. Did you know the poinsettia's red parts aren't actually flowers? They're leaves called bracts. The real flowers are those tiny yellow buds in the middle. Today, poinsettias come in over a hundred shades—pink, white, marbled, even speckled. Whatever your style, there's a poinsettia to match your mood.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
