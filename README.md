> Welcome to the world, bear cub! After spending the first months of its life inside the den, this little American black bear may be puzzled by the outside world. The cubs are born between January and February and emerge from their dens in the spring, weighing around 5 pounds. By their first birthday, they can grow to about 80 pounds. However, their weight—which ranges between 100 and 600 pounds for adults—depends on their age, sex, the season, and food available in their area. Black bears are the only bears found in Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, which provides the setting for today's image.

> 'These streets will make you feel brand new, big lights will inspire you.' Alicia Keys sure knows how to serenade the vibrant, bustling life of the Big Apple. Today's homepage image takes us to Union Square in lower Manhattan. At this historic intersection, you can find statues of George Washington—the oldest statue in any park in NYC—and Abraham Lincoln, crafted by the sculptor Henry Kirke Brown. In 1882, workers exercised their rights to free speech and assembly, organizing the first Labor Day parade here. In 1997, Union Square was recognized as a National Historic Landmark due to its importance in US labor history. These days, you're more likely to see street chess players, musicians, skateboarders, dance crews, and vendors of all types in the square.

> 'Art is the queen of all sciences communicating knowledge to all the generations of the world.' Let’s ponder these inspirational words by Leonardo da Vinci on World Art Day, April 15, which was also the birthday of the renowned Renaissance artist. From his iconic painting of the Mona Lisa to his detailed sketches of flying machines, Leonardo pushed the boundaries of knowledge and talent in a wide range of fields. Today's homepage shows the RedBall Project at Centraal Station in Antwerp, Belgium. Created by the American artist Kurt Perschke, this traveling public art installation is considered to be the world's longest-running street artwork. Since 2001, the 15-foot inflated red ball has been wedged into dozens of landmarks in countries from Australia to England.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to nature's bowling alley. Bowling Ball Beach on the Mendocino Coast in California is named after the striking rock formations strewn across the shore. These sandstone balls—a phenomenon known as concretions—formed over millions of years as sedimentary layers built up around a central core of sand and stone held together by mineral cements. Erosion gradually wore away the outer layers to expose the spherical shapes we see today. This created a fascinating spectacle that only appears at low tide. Concretions are rare, and there has been plenty of wild speculation about where they come from, with some believing them to be extraterrestrial debris while others wondering if they are dinosaur fossils. The answer, however, is quite simple: it is the forces of nature at play.

> If you fancy a stroll through time, Arches National Park is the perfect gateway! With over 2,000 natural stone arches, hundreds of tall pinnacles, large rock fins, and giant balanced rocks, this park is among the world's most scenic destinations. In the popular Windows Section, covering just over 2 square miles, there are spectacular rock formations including North Window, Turret Arch, and Double Arch. Others include Garden of Eden, Elephant Butte, a 5,653-foot summit, and Parade of Elephants, so visitors are never short of awesome sights to enjoy.

> The region was once a vast dry seabed hidden beneath thousands of feet of earth but was gradually transformed by geological forces to become the spectacular space we see today. Humans have explored and lived in this area for millennia. Around 2,000 years ago, its nomadic inhabitants began to cultivate crops. However, environmental challenges, possibly aggravated by climate shifts, eventually led to a decline in farming activities.
