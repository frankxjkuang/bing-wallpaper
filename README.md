> It's World Teachers' Day, time to celebrate those who dedicate their lives to transmitting knowledge, skills, and experience. Just as teachers shape minds and futures, nature too offers its own ways of passing knowledge. Nestled in the rocky landscapes of the Antarctic Peninsula and Antarctic islands, gentoo penguin hatchlings, born in pairs, benefit from dedicated parental support. The father and mother raise them in a bonded, monogamous pair, bringing food back to the stony nest they have built together. After being fed and raised for 30 days, the chicks join a larger flock known as a crèche or nursery for safety and to learn social behavior. Penguin parents and their community pass on their wisdom through the language of survival.

> It's World Space Week, an opportunity to celebrate humanity's extraterrestrial achievements, as well as the benefits that come from space exploration and technology. The star of our homepage is actually a star-forming region known as the Tarantula Nebula, found in the same group of galaxies as our Milky Way. This detailed image was captured by the powerful James Webb Space Telescope and shows thousands of never-before-seen stars, previously obscured by cosmic dust. The nebula's colossal size and dynamic energy offer plenty of compelling material for astronomers and stargazers of all stripes.

The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park surrounds and protects the islands, once home to the Ngaro people of Australia, an Aboriginal group known as the 'canoe people' due to their seafaring lifestyle. Today, the island's primary visitors are travelers, divers, campers, and adventure seekers. So, pack your sunscreen and explore the pristine white sand beaches on your next vacation down under!

> Did you know that the name Louis Vuitton is linked with more than just fashion? The eye-catching structure in today's image is the Louis Vuitton Foundation, an art museum and cultural center in Paris, France. The extravagant building opened in 2014, the result of a collaboration between the luxury goods company's CEO, Bernard Arnault, and renowned architect Frank Gehry. Gehry drew inspiration from iconic Parisian buildings, including the glass-roofed 19th-century Grand Palais exhibition hall, and applied concepts from 19th-century English landscape gardens.

> But architecture isn't just about stunning grand structures like this one. World Architecture Day was established in 1985 by the International Union of Architects to align with UN World Habitat Day. On the first Monday of October, both reflect on the basic rights of everyone to housing and shelter, and the responsibilities of those who shape towns and cities.

> Nestled amidst the Julian Alps, Slovenia's Lake Bled invites you to step into a storybook setting. The star of the show? The tiny Bled Island, which beckons with the promise of legends and 'rowmance.' Make your way there on a traditional, flat-bottomed pletna boat, piloted by oarsmen whose skills have been handed down through generations since 1740. The island is home to the 17th-century Assumption of Mary Church, with its special bell that, legend says, will make wishes come true. If you look to the shore directly above the island in our image, you can spot Bled Castle overlooking the lake's expanse. The castle—one of the oldest in Slovenia—is positioned on a precipice above the town of Bled on the northwestern shore of the lake.

> As summer's warmth gently yields to autumn's cool embrace, the Mid-Autumn Festival lights up the Chinese city of Guiyang, celebrating the full moon and the autumn harvest. Also known as the Moon Festival, it takes place on the 15th day of the year's eighth lunar month in the Chinese calendar.
> 
> The harvest has been celebrated around the autumn full moon since China's Shang dynasty, more than 3,000 years ago. During the festival, families reunite to enjoy delectable mooncakes, admire the beauty of the moon, express gratitude, and tell tales of Chang'e, the Chinese goddess of the moon, and her husband Hou Yi, a legendary archer.

> Similar festivals are celebrated in Japan, Vietnam, South Korea, and other countries in East and Southeast Asia. Jiaxiu Tower, pictured on our homepage, was built in 1598, so it has witnessed many Mid-Autumn Festivals. Under the moonlit sky, lanterns adorn the tower, illuminating the streets, symbolizing hope, good fortune, and unity.
