> If you're a lover of history with a dash of drama, the Château de Sully-sur-Loire, in the center of northern France, has you covered. This fortress has seen it all—battles, power shifts, and royal connections. Originally built in the 14th century, the medieval castle was designed to guard the Loire River and control access to the region. Over time, it evolved into a residence for nobility, most notably serving as the home of Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully, who was a trusted minister of King Henry IV. The castle played a significant role during the French Wars of Religion from 1562 to 1598 and has witnessed countless moments of intrigue and diplomacy. In 1940, during World War II, the castle wall was hit by shells, creating massive holes, but the framework remained intact.
> 
> Today, after multiple restorations, the castle welcomes visitors eager to uncover its history. It also stands as an example of French Renaissance architecture. Visitors can explore the imposing towers, thick stone walls, and the beautiful moat that once protected the castle from invaders. The restored interiors feature authentic furniture and artifacts, offering a window into medieval life. Guided tours provide insights into the castle's role in shaping regional and national history. Beyond the stone walls, the surrounding park is an inviting space for explorers to unwind and take in the views of the Loire River.

> Let's be real—the beaches in Bali are beautiful, but the ones in Nusa Penida? That's a whole new vibe. This off-the-beaten-path island, part of the Bali province, is where nature gets a little wild, and the sights are nothing short of epic. With its rugged cliffs and crystal-clear waters, the island offers an escape from Bali's busier tourist hubs. The name 'Nusa Penida' translates to 'island of priests,' and historically, it served as a spiritual retreat, with temples and rituals that locals still honor today.
> 
> One of the island's most iconic attractions is Broken Beach, or 'Pasih Uug,' as locals call it, seen in today's image. This marvel features a circular bay in the cliff rocks, carved out by the relentless ocean waves, leading to a small white-sand beach. Some local legends claim the hollow bay was formed by a giant's footsteps, while others attribute it to an angry sorcerer. As you explore, you might spot manta rays gliding gracefully through the waters below, showcasing the island's marine life. The views from the top are unmatched, making this spot a haven for photographers and those seeking a peaceful escape.

> Feeling a bit tired? You're not alone—losing an hour to daylight saving time can leave anyone groggy. That's why Napping Day exists. Introduced in 1999 by William Anthony, a Boston University professor, and his wife, Camille, this unofficial holiday encourages everyone to take quality naps. Observed on the Monday after clocks spring forward, it's a reminder that rest is essential for well-being. Research backs it up—short naps boost mood, enhance concentration, and sharpen memory. Napping is also linked to lower stress and better heart health. While power naps (20-30 minutes) are ideal for a quick recharge, even a few minutes of shut-eye can help.
> 
> In Uganda's Queen Elizabeth National Park, some lions take napping to new heights—quite literally. The tree-climbing lions of the Ishasha Sector have a habit of sprawling across the branches of giant fig trees, as seen in today's image. Experts believe they climb to escape ground-level heat or pesky insects, but these naps make for an unforgettable sight. This vast park spans volcanic craters, open plains, and dense forests. A safari here promises encounters with Uganda's incredible wildlife.

> It's the time of year again when clocks spring forward, stealing an hour of sleep but giving us longer evenings to enjoy. Daylight saving time (DST) starts today at 2 AM, except in Arizona and Hawaii, reminding us that time, quite literally, waits for no one. The idea is simple: maximizing daylight and reducing energy consumption by syncing our activities with the natural light cycle. This concept was popularized by Benjamin Franklin in the 18th century, though his suggestion to 'save candles' was more satirical than a serious proposal. Fast-forward to the early 20th century, when many countries adopted DST to conserve fuel during wartime. The US officially standardized it in 1966 with the Uniform Time Act. Today, DST runs from March to November in around 70 countries, giving eight months of extended evening light.

> The clock in today's image—St. Mark's Clock Tower—is in Venice, Italy, where it has been keeping time for over 500 years. This Renaissance masterpiece tracks the moon, the sun, and the zodiac. Towering above is the city's iconic winged lion and two bronze Moors who strike the bell with theatrical precision.

> Happy International Women's Day, everyone! It's a global celebration of resilience, rights, and remarkable women. First observed in the early 1900s, the day traces its roots to labor movements led by women fighting for better pay, improved working conditions, and voting rights. From its beginnings in 1911, when over a million people attended rallies in Europe, the day has grown into a worldwide movement. Today, it's marked by events, protests, and campaigns addressing issues like gender pay gaps, domestic violence, and access to education. From trailblazers like Marie Curie, who illuminated science, to Malala Yousafzai, who champions education, women have proven time and again that they don't just participate; they innovate.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Nature's desert navigators—desert bighorn sheep—are a marvel to watch, effortlessly scaling cliffs and navigating rocky terrains with grace. Native to North America, these sheep are known for their distinctive curled horns, which can weigh up to 30 pounds. Rams use their massive horns in intense head-butting contests. During these battles, they hurl themselves at each other in charges of up to 20 miles per hour. Ewes, on the other hand, tend to keep things more low-key, forming smaller groups with their lambs. Adapted to the desert environment, the desert bighorn sheep sub-species can go long periods without water, relying on moisture from plants to survive.
> 
> Valley of Fire State Park, seen in today's image, is one of the best spots in Nevada to observe these desert dwellers. This park is named for its fiery red sandstone formations that seem to glow under the sun. Beyond its natural beauty, the park holds deep historical significance, with petroglyphs left by ancient Indigenous peoples. It has also earned a place in pop culture as a filming location for scenes from 'Star Trek Generations.' Keep an eye on the rocky outcrops during your visit—you might spot a bighorn sheep observing you.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
