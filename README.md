> The Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes, located near Stovepipe Wells Village in Death Valley National Park, are the most accessible and iconic dunes in the park. They are formed by a combination of eroding mountains to the north that supply sand, prevailing winds that move it, and surrounding mountains that trap it from the south—creating a stunning landscape of rippling sand hills. Named after the resilient mesquite trees that grow here, the dunes offer breathtaking views at sunrise and sunset, as well as exceptional stargazing opportunities.
> 
> Death Valley National Park, spanning more than 3.4 million acres, is the largest national park in the contiguous United States. It is known for its extreme temperatures, vast desert landscapes, and geological diversity. More than 93% of the park is designated wilderness, offering opportunities for backcountry exploration, though visitors must be cautious of hazards like extreme heat, flash floods, and wildlife. Despite its harsh environment, the park is rich in natural beauty and cultural history, including its deep ties to the Timbisha Shoshone people, who have lived in the region for generations.

> Every summer, the world's best cyclists take on one of the most grueling athletic events in modern sports—the Tour de France. Beginning this year on July 5, the 2025 race will span 21 stages and over 2,000 miles across France. First held in 1903 to boost newspaper sales, the Tour has grown into cycling's most iconic race. Riders compete in mountain climbs, sprints, and time trials, with the race traditionally ending in Paris.

> Every year on July 4, Americans come together to celebrate the birth of our nation. It marks the day in 1776 when the Declaration of Independence was adopted, proclaiming the original 13 colonies' freedom from British rule. From coast to coast, we celebrate with fireworks, BBQs, parades, and patriotic music—and Seattle hosts one of the most dazzling displays in the country.
> 
> Set against the backdrop of Lake Union, Seattle's fireworks light up the night sky, reflecting the city's vibrant mix of history, diversity, and innovation. The most populous city in the Pacific Northwest, Seattle has deep roots—from its Indigenous heritage to its role as the birthplace of grunge to its importance as a technology center. This Fourth of July, whether you're watching with the crowds at Gas Works Park or friends on a rooftop deck, take a moment to reflect on our shared past—and the freedom to honor it together.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Nestled in the northern Gulf Coast of Florida, is Rainbow Springs State Park. This area has served as a natural resource for humans and animals for centuries, with the Rainbow River—flowing through the park—playing a major role. The gently winding waterway is fed by Rainbow Springs, one of Florida's largest springs. The water that bubbles up here comes from a 770-square-mile area and eventually flows into the Withlacoochee River.
> 
> The Rainbow River's transparent waters are perfect for swimming and snorkeling, and they maintain a constant temperature of 72°F year-round. The park's history dates to the late 1880s, when hard rock phosphate was discovered in the area, leading to a boomtown era. This period saw the rapid growth of a small community called Juliette near the springs, driven by the phosphate mining industry. During the 1960s, the park emerged as a popular tourist destination, featuring glass-bottom boat rides, a monorail system, and even a rodeo. Today, visitors can explore the ornamental gardens, waterfalls, and walking paths, and enjoy the diverse wildlife that calls Rainbow Springs home.

<summary>Description</summary>

> That bright fish hiding in the anemone? That's the spine-cheeked anemonefish, or the maroon clownfish, and it is not just a cute creature. Native to the Indo-Pacific, from western Indonesia to Taiwan and the Great Barrier Reef, this species lives on the edges of coral reefs. It is easily distinguished by the spine extending from each cheek—hence the name. Groups of spine-cheeked anemonefish form around a single dominant female, and if she disappears, the top male steps up—literally changing sex to take her place. Spine-cheeked anemonefish thrive in warm, shallow waters and stick close to their chosen sea anemone.
> 
> The closest marine companion of a spine-cheeked anemonefish is the bubble-tip anemone, as seen in the image. These anemones don't all look alike—their appearances often vary with age, depth, and whether they host anemonefish. This species offers the perfect mix of cover and protection. In return, the fish defend the anemone from threats and remove debris from its surface. It's a stable, symbiotic bond that benefits both partners and keeps them closely tied to the same patch of reef.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today, Canada turns another year older. Canada Day is a nod to the moment when the country officially came together in 1867. What began as a confederation of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia has grown into a nation of 10 provinces and 3 territories. Originally called Dominion Day, the name was changed to Canada Day in 1982—the same year the Constitution Act was signed, granting the country full control over its constitution. While Canada Day is not the country's 'Independence Day,' it's the closest thing to it. Canadians celebrate this holiday with fireworks, parades, concerts, and community events. Ottawa, the country's capital, hosts one of the biggest celebrations, featuring music and speeches on Parliament Hill.
> 
> On this day, it is hard to miss how the red and white houses in Tilting mirror the colors of the Canadian flag. Tilting, a village on Fogo Island in Newfoundland and Labrador, was settled by Irish immigrants in the 18th century. It remains a unique example of an Irish outport community that has preserved its cultural identity. The bright fishing sheds and homes weren't painted just for aesthetics; the hues once made buildings easier to spot during heavy fog or snowfall. These vivid colors also reflect the practical, resourceful life of the people who settled here.

> Each scar on Earth from a meteorite impact tells a story—from the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs to the lesser-known craters that dot the planet. Asteroid Day highlights ongoing research into asteroids and the potential threats they pose. Started in 2015 and backed by the United Nations, this day marks the anniversary of the Tunguska event—a massive explosion that occurred in Siberia on June 30, 1908. This explosion flattened over 800 square miles of Siberian forest near the Tunguska River. The blast released energy equal to 10–15 megatons of TNT, a standard measure of explosive force. Since then, craters like Arizona's Barringer, Quebec's Manicouagan, and others have helped scientists study what happens when space rocks hit Earth.
> 
> Wolfe Creek Crater in Western Australia, pictured here, was created by a meteorite estimated to have weighed over 14,000 tons. The crater is about 2,871 feet in diameter and sits within Wolfe Creek Meteorite Crater National Park, a remote protected area. The park's flat plains and desert grasslands make the crater's rim especially visible. Today, visitors can walk along the rim and learn about its significance to both science and local Indigenous communities.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
