<summary>Description</summary>

> Beyond water, rivers carry life, history, and stories. They are nature's ever-moving contribution to our landscapes, flowing through lands and across time. One such gem is the Snake River, which winds through Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. A particularly stunning spot along this river is Oxbow Bend—featured in today's image—where calm waters reflect the towering Teton Range, and wildlife such as moose and bald eagles thrive. Here, water flows freely, unbound by concrete or commerce, protected by the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, signed on this day in 1968.
> 
> This landmark law is a promise: that some rivers shall run wild forever. It safeguards waters with 'outstandingly remarkable' beauty, ecology, and spirit—rivers that sing of wilderness and whisper of heritage. The Snake River Headwaters, including Oxbow Bend, joined this sacred list in 2009, ensuring its reflections remain undisturbed and its rhythms unbroken.
> 
> At dawn, mist dances over the bend, and the mountains blush with the first light. Visitors pause, hushed by nature's poetry. Thanks to this Act, the river's story flows on—untamed, unspoiled, unforgettable.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> This year marks another milestone in the legacy of Yosemite National Park, a sanctuary protected since 1864 and celebrated for its awe-inspiring grandeur and ecological significance. Nestled in the heart of the Sierra Nevada, Yosemite's nearly 1,200 square miles cradle granite giants, cascading waterfalls, and ancient sequoias. Among its lesser-known treasures lies the Clark Range—the rugged, high-elevation spine seen in today's image. It was named after Galen Clark, Yosemite's first guardian and a pioneer of conservation.
> 
> The Clark Range stands as a quiet sentinel to Yosemite's southern wilderness, its peaks etched by glaciers and crowned with alpine meadows. Here, the wind whispers through whitebark pines and the sky opens wide, echoing the spirit of foresight that birthed the park.
> 
> As we honor Yosemite's anniversary, we celebrate not only its grandeur but the enduring vision of those who fought to preserve it. From the valley's granite walls to the Clark Range's serene heights, this national park remains a living poem—written in stone, water, and time.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Amid the lush eucalyptus canopy of Great Otway National Park, koalas reign as sleepy sentinels of Australia's wild soul. Often misnamed 'koala bears,' these marsupials are actually closer to wombats and tend to be instantly recognizable by their stout, tailless bodies, fluffy ears, and velvety black noses.
> 
> Their diet is notoriously selective—koalas feed almost exclusively on certain eucalyptus leaves laced with toxins that most animals can't digest. To survive, they sleep up to 20 hours a day while a specialized, bacteria-rich gut works to neutralize the poison. This slow-motion lifestyle is nature's masterstroke of adaptation.
> 
> Yet their future hangs in the balance. From habitat loss, disease, and climate-driven threats like bushfires, koalas are at a critical crossroads. But forest restoration, dedicated sanctuaries, and Indigenous-led conservation are beginning to turn the tide. With continued care, these gentle climbers can cling to the treetops (and to our hearts) as enduring symbols of Australia's wild spirit for generations to come.

<summary>Description</summary>

> You won't find souvenir shops or tourist maps pointing the way—but follow the edge of Lake Rietplas in Houten, and you'll stumble upon one of the Netherlands' most unexpectedly photogenic sights. While many flock to Amsterdam's canals or Rotterdam's cube houses, this quiet commuter town offers its own architectural twist. Lined up like a mirage, the Rainbow Houses shimmer in bold, painterly hues—a residential block turned an understated cultural landmark.
> 
> To locals, they're simply part of the daily backdrop. But for photographers and design lovers, they're a dreamscape of saturation and symmetry. Designed by Hans Been and completed in 2005, the ensemble blends Caribbean flair with Nordic restraint, echoing the look of a minimalist fishing village. Each house reflects a different color of the spectrum. This isn't a curated tourist stop; these are lived-in homes, part of a neighborhood shaped by the same thoughtful planning that makes Houten one of the most bike-friendly towns in the country. Best seen from across the lake or a nearby bridge, these vibrant facades feel like a secret you're lucky to catch in the right light: charming, surprising, and refreshingly under the radar.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Some towns evolve slowly over centuries. Pienza? It received a full rebrand in the 1400s from a pope who wanted to prove a point—and maybe show off a little. This tiny Italian town is perched above the Val d'Orcia, surrounded by rolling hills that look exactly like you think Tuscany should: cypress trees, winding dirt roads, the occasional sheep. It's peaceful. And then you step inside the town walls, and it gets clever.
> 
> Pienza was once a regular medieval village called Corsignano. That is, until one of its sons became Pope Pius II and decided to transform his hometown. He hired architect Bernardo Rossellino and rebuilt the area based on Renaissance ideals of symmetry, order, and harmony. The result? A site that feels intentional. The central square, Piazza Pio II, is flanked by a cathedral, a papal palace, and a town hall, all arranged just so. Moreover, Pienza is known for pecorino cheese—sheep's milk, aged in interesting ways. And once a year, the whole town turns into a cheese arena for Fiera del Cacio, a festival featuring Cacio al Fuso—a game where people roll wheels of cheese at a target.

<summary>Description</summary>

> When the calendar lines up just right, you get a rare double feature: National Public Lands Day and Astronomy Day. It's a chance to explore the landscapes that ground us and the skies that inspire us—all within 24 hours.
> 
> National Public Lands Day, held on the fourth Saturday of September, is America's biggest single-day volunteer event for parks, forests, and other shared spaces. Volunteers rake, plant, and pick up litter—all while enjoying free admission to these sites. Astronomy Day comes twice a year, with the fall version offering longer nights and darker skies. The goal is simple: help more people discover the universe. Many parks are far from city lights, making them prime spots for seeing the Milky Way, meteor showers, and constellations without interference. Remote places like Tank Lakes in Washington's Alpine Lakes Wilderness, pictured here, offer exactly that.
> 
> This year, why not make it a two-for-one celebration? Hike a trail by day, then trace constellations by night. On National Public Lands Day, you might cross paths with a deer or eagle. On Astronomy Day, your companions could be Orion or Cassiopeia. Different worlds, same sense of wonder.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> In the world of woodland critters, the least chipmunk might seem like the 'undersquirrel'—but don't count it out. With survival smarts and turbo-charged feet, this tiny rodent proves that being 'least' is no reason to squirrel away your potential. Weighing less than a deck of cards and measuring under 10 inches from nose to tail, this species is North America's smallest chipmunk.
> 
> When it's not sprinting up logs or vanishing into leaf piles, it is stuffing its face—literally. Its expandable cheek pouches help it haul seeds, berries, and insects to storage spots. Come winter, it doesn't fully hibernate. Instead, it enters a light torpor, waking every so often for a snack. Not one for group living, each least chipmunk carves out its own territory every summer, usually with a hidden burrow and a backup food cache or ten. But if a predator wanders too close, you'll hear chip-chip-chip alarms sounding off.
> 
> Did you know that a least chipmunk's memory is so sharp that it can remember the locations of hundreds of food caches, even after a long winter nap? So next time you forget where you parked, just remember—a chipmunk wouldn't have.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
