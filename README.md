> Happy Easter! Do you like your eggs boiled or painted? The practice of painting chicken eggs, which originates from Persian traditions, was adopted by Christians in the early 17th century to commemorate this holiday, also called Pascha. Hungarian artist, Tünde Csuhaj—living and working in the small city of southern Hungary, Szekszárd—has mastered the craft. The internationally recognized egg-painter developed her own etching technique to create lace-like patterns. The meticulous designs appear on all sorts of eggs, including chicken, goose, swan, and even emu or ostrich eggs. The intricate motifs of incredible craftsmanship are often shown at national and international fairs and exhibitions. Are you inspired? Grab a paintbrush and test your egg-painting skills.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Costa Rica's forests are habitats for two sloth species: Hoffmann's two-toed sloth and the star of today's homepage, the brown-throated three-toed sloth. Despite being larger than many other tree-dwelling mammals, three-toed sloths have adapted by reducing their muscle mass and size to thrive on treetops. Their large stomachs have four chambers, which, when full, account for about 30% of their body weight. These shaggy critters are so sedentary that algae grow on their coats, which helps to camouflage them within the rainforest canopy. In 2021, these slow-moving creatures were declared national symbols in Costa Rica. Then-president Carlos Alvarado signed the initiative into law to emphasize the sloths' importance in the country's ecosystem.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Built on the rugged cliffs of Holy Island, Wales, the South Stack Lighthouse stands watch over the deep waters of the Irish Sea. The 91-foot-tall white tower has guided sailors since its completion in 1809; it provides safe passage for ships on the Dublin-Holyhead-Liverpool route. When it was built, sperm whale oil was used to light the lamps; however, over the years, the mechanism has been upgraded to more advanced technology like LED bulbs and Fresnel lenses. Automated in 1984, the lighthouse continues to serve as a vital navigational aid, with its powerful beam shining up to 28 miles. As the sun sets and the sky fills with colors, the silhouette of the South Stack Lighthouse in the dusk makes for a stunning sight. Visitors brave the 400-step descent down the steep cliff face to explore the lighthouse, including its engine room and exhibition area.

> In spring, nature puts on a vibrant display, marking the start of the season with the bloom of cherry blossoms. Around the globe, from Japan to the United States, this spectacle captivates millions of hearts. In China, cherry blossoms, known as 'Yinghua,' bloom from late March to late April, adorning landscapes with delicate hues of pink and white. Revered for centuries by the Chinese, these fragile petals hold profound significance in their traditions, symbolizing renewal, hope, and the transient nature of life. Among popular places to see them are Wuhan's East Lake Cherry Blossom Park, Lu Xun Park in Shanghai, and Beijing's Yuyuantan Park. Cherry blossoms look similar to plum blossoms, but an easy way to distinguish between the two is to look at their petals. Cherry blossom petals have split ends, but plum blossoms don't.

> Welcome to Hang Rai, a blend of ancient rock formations and vibrant coral reefs. Also called Rai Cave, this cavern is part of the Vinh Hy Bay—enclosed by Nui Chua National Park—in the South Central Coast region of Vietnam. The area's natural coral reefs are surrounded by rock formations that are stacked upon each other to form a group of caves. One origin of the name 'Hang Rai' or 'Rai Cave' comes from otters (rai) that were occasionally seen seeking shelter in the caves. Another explanation is attributed to the abundance of rai trees in the area, whose oil was used to waterproof boats. The landscape is an awe-inspiring sight both under and above water: corals for deep divers and colorful sunsets for those who like camping in the sea breeze.
