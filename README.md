<summary>Description</summary>

> Every spring, Washington, DC, transforms into a sea of pink and white as the cherry trees bloom, marking the return of the National Cherry Blossom Festival. This beloved event commemorates the 1912 gift of 3,000 cherry trees from Tokyo's Mayor Yukio Ozaki to the US, symbolizing the friendship between the two nations.
> 
> This year's festival runs through April 13, with the peak bloom period expected to last four to seven days, depending on the weather. The Tidal Basin is the most popular spot for viewing, offering breathtaking scenes near landmarks like the Jefferson Memorial and the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial. If you prefer a quieter experience, check out Dumbarton Oaks or the National Arboretum for off-the-beaten-path beauty. Will you be visiting this year? If so, we recommend you arrive early in the morning or in the evening for the best views and fewer crowds. And remember—look, but don't touch! Picking the blossoms is against the law and harms the trees.

> Have you ever spotted a rainbow and felt a little lucky? National Find a Rainbow Day, celebrated today, is all about looking to the sky for that magical mix of sun and rain. Nature's color wheel has long been linked to myths and legends, from Norse gods to the Irish leprechaun's pot of gold. But beyond folklore, the science behind rainbows is just as compelling. The first real explanation came from Theodoric of Freiberg, a German physicist, in 1304. He discovered that rainbows form when sunlight enters a raindrop, bends, reflects inside, and then bends again as it exits. This process splits light into its colors, creating the spectrum we see. The classic 'ROYGBIV' (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet) doesn't tell the whole story—rainbows contain millions of colors blended together.
> 
> Not all rainbows look the same. Double rainbows occur when a fainter, reversed arc appears above the main one. Moonbows happen at night when moonlight refracts through water droplets. The rare supernumerary rainbow features extra pastel bands inside the primary arc. Today's image features a rainbow over Wasson Peak in Saguaro National Park, Arizona. Against a backdrop of desert cacti and rocky slopes, the vibrant arc stands out in a place where rain is scarce, proving that even the driest landscapes can surprise you.

> Wavy sandstone ridges stretch across the Caineville Badlands, Utah, resembling nature's brushstrokes on stone. These formations are made of fine-grained sediment that settled in ancient river deltas and inland seas and later hardened into stone. Over time, erosion carved through the layers, exposing flowing, ripple-like patterns. The sedimentary layers tell a story of shifting climates and ancient landscapes. The barren land, seen in today's image, may appear lifeless, but during early spring, rainfall blankets the terrain with tiny purple and yellow flowers. Light and shadow shift throughout the day, offering photographers and visitors various angles. While much of the terrain remains rugged, some areas offer easy access, allowing visitors to explore without strenuous hiking.
> 
> Badlands exist on every continent except Antarctica. Early explorers named them after struggling to navigate harsh terrains. Fossil hunters frequently uncover remnants of prehistoric creatures in the eroded hills. Despite the extreme conditions, these lands support a wide range of life, including desert plants, lizards, and birds.

> April is National Frog Month, and let's be honest, frogs don't always get the attention they deserve. These little jumpers have been around since dinosaurs roamed the Earth, and they've evolved into some of the weirdest, coolest creatures out there. With over 4,000 known species worldwide, they come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny New Guinea Amau frog—smaller than a dime—to the large Goliath frog, which can weigh more than 7 pounds. Some, like the glass frog, are nearly transparent, while others are extremely poisonous. The golden poison frog, for example, carries enough toxin to take down 10 humans. And if you think all frogs are swamp-dwellers, meet the desert rain frog, a round little amphibian that survives in dry conditions by absorbing moisture through its skin.
> 
> This month is the perfect excuse to give them the credit they deserve. Frogs play a crucial role in ecosystems by controlling insect populations and serving as prey for many predators. However, habitat loss, pollution, and disease threaten many species(source). Although the origin of National Frog Month is unclear, conservation groups, educators, and zoos have embraced the month to emphasize the need to protect frog populations. Events often focus on habitat preservation, breeding programs, and simple actions people can take, like reducing pesticide use in gardens. National Frog Month serves as a reminder that these amphibians are more than just backyard croakers—they are a vital part of the natural world.

> Perched on a hilltop overlooking the Adriatic Sea, there is a historic city that enchants visitors with its labyrinth of whitewashed buildings, winding alleyways, and a sun-drenched piazza. Welcome to Ostuni, in the Apulia region of Italy. Apulia is a southeastern area of the country, located in the heel of Italy's 'boot.' It has the longest coastline of any mainland region in the country and is home to numerous attractions, including beaches, cliffs, and charming cities like the one we see in today's image.
> 
> Known as the White City, Ostuni's white facades serve a practical purpose—reflecting the sun's rays to keep interiors cool. The center of the city features the Gothic-style Ostuni Cathedral, which boasts an intricate rose window dating back to the 15th century. Nearby, the Diocesan Museum, opened in 2017, houses treasures from local churches and monasteries, including Byzantine icons, Apulian sculptures, and an 18th-century wax crucifix. Piazza della Libertà, Ostuni's lively hub, is home to the Column of St. Oronzo, which honors the patron saint who saved the city from the plague in 1657. Whether you're drawn by history or simply love wandering through idyllic streets, Ostuni has something for everyone.

> Today's photo features a spot in Sydney, Australia, where shimmery waters meet famous landmarks: Port Jackson, more commonly known as Sydney Harbour. In the center, we have a bird's-eye view of the Sydney Opera House, an architectural icon with sail-like shells that shine bright under the Australian sun. Designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, this UNESCO World Heritage Site took 14 years to complete and hosts over 1,500 performances annually. Just across the harbor, on the left side of the picture, the Sydney Harbour Bridge—affectionately called 'the Coathanger' for its arching steel frame—connects the city's northern and southern shores. When it opened in 1932, it was the world's widest long-span bridge. Adventurous visitors can climb its 440-foot summit for breathtaking panoramic views.
> 
> Every New Year's Eve, this waterfront transforms into the stage for spectacular fireworks displays, attracting over a million spectators and millions more watching worldwide. The dazzling show, launched from the bridge and barges across the harbor, is a bucket-list experience. No matter what time of year, Sydney Harbour promises an experience filled with history, adventure, and beauty at every turn.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> It's not every day you see a desert burst into colors, but during a superbloom, arid land is covered with endless stretches of flowers. This rare phenomenon happens in California and Arizona when the rainy season awakens wildflower seeds that have been lying dormant in the soil. Superblooms in California typically occur once a decade, but prolonged droughts in the 21st century have made them increasingly less frequent. Drawing attention to California's diverse flora and rural federal lands, this event offers a temporary boost to local economies.
> 
> One of the best spots to witness this spectacular phenomenon is Carrizo Plain National Monument, seen in today's image. A vast enclosed grassland in southeastern San Luis Obispo County, California, this spot is approximately 50 miles long and 15 miles wide. Here, the hills of the Temblor and Caliente Ranges, along with the valley floor near Soda Lake, transform into a patchwork of colorful wildflowers. Have you ever had the chance to see a superbloom?

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
