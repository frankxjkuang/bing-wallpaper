<summary>Description</summary>

> This solemn beacon set atop a rocky outcropping is in a country usually associated with sand and sun, making this a side of Spain many do not often see. We're looking out at the sea on the Costa da Morte, or Coast of Death, a nasty name for an equally nasty (but beautiful!) stretch of Galician coastline in the extreme northwest of Spain. We're featuring Costa da Morte during International Lighthouse Weekend because mariners are never happier to see a lighthouse than when they're sailing this coast, known as the Bermuda Triangle of the Eastern Atlantic.
> 
> The Costa da Morte is known for its lighthouses, like this one, called Faro de Playa Lago, one of many strung along 125 miles of coast from Finisterre in the south to Malpica in the north.  As a devourer of ships, the Costa da Morte is prolific. Since the 14th century, more than 600 shipwrecks costing thousands of lives have been documented. The rocky Costa da Morte faces the open North Atlantic and takes the brunt of big ocean swells. Deep waters turn to shallow waters quickly near this rocky cliff-strewn coast, known for its strong currents and hidden rocks. The fog can roll in quickly. Storms form frequently. And hurricane-force winds are not uncommon.
> 
> Cool, rainy, and rocky, the Galicia region of Spain is more 'Lord of the Rings' than Club Med. To visit the lighthouses of Costa da Morte, you can walk a trail appropriately called Camino dos Faros (Road of the Lighthouses). While satellite technology and electronic instruments have vastly changed how safely we can now navigate the seas, lighthouses are still vital to boating and the maritime industry. Plus, they're just darn good-looking.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we're celebrating World Honey Bee Day, honoring the humble bee's role in pollinating our crops and sharing honey goodness with us. It's remarkable to consider that there are around 20,000 different species of bees in the world, but just eight species of honey bees. And it's sobering to realize how fragile their existence is. Billions of honey bees have disappeared over the last 15 years in what's known as colony collapse disorder. There's no definitive explanation for the die-off, though scientists believe pesticides, loss of habitat, climate change, mite infestation, and disease are contributing factors. Now we need to reintroduce bees and other pollinators to safeguard our food system.
> 
> Of course, besides pollinating plants, bees produce honey to feed their hive community over the winter. And since honey bees produce double or triple the amount of honey they need, there's plenty for us to enjoy, too. Unfortunately for busy beekeepers here in the northwest province of Asturias, Spain, local endangered brown bears are also partial to snacking on honey. Hence the traditional stone wall protecting the hives from sticky-pawed thieves.
> 
> While the bear has always had pride of place in Spanish culture—it's the symbol of Madrid, for example—bears' reputation for plundering honey hives and sometimes even killing livestock makes them unpopular with beekeepers and farmers. The brown bears of Spain were once aggressively hunted, and the bear population fell to dangerously low levels by the 1970s. Conservationists worked to gain legal protection for the bears, and now there's a delicate balance between bears and bees in Asturias. Ecotourism here in the Muniellos Nature Reserve helps beekeepers and farmers sustain their businesses, with carefully organized tours allowing visitors to observe the bears from a distance while spending money on local honey. Sweet.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In the summer of 2016, an experimental solar-powered airplane called Solar Impulse 2 completed a 26,000-mile multi-stage trip around the world without using a single drop of jet fuel. The remarkable feat took longer than a year and made the slow-flying plane part of aviation history. We are remembering this seminal flight today to mark National Aviation Day, established in 1939 by President Franklin Roosevelt as a day to celebrate the advancement of flight. August 19 was chosen because it is the birthdate of Orville Wright, who in 1903, with his brother Wilbur Wright, became the first to achieve powered, controlled flight on the hills of Kitty Hawk on North Carolina's Outer Banks.
> 
> Solar Impulse 2 was the second aircraft built by Swiss aviators André Borschberg and Bertrand Piccard. Borschberg is an engineer by training, Piccard a psychiatrist and balloonist who copiloted the first balloon to fly around the world nonstop. The pair took turns piloting the aircraft, which can carry only one person, on a multi-leg, 16-month flight around the world that started and ended in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.
> 
> This image was taken during the final leg from Egypt to Abu Dhabi as Solar Impulse 2 flew over the Great Pyramids of Giza. The superlight plane was powered by thousands of solar cells mounted atop its fuselage and jumbo-jet sized wings. Batteries stored energy so it could fly at night. The going was slow by the standards of modern jet travel—Solar Impulse 2 flew at an average speed of 50 mph. Clearly, solar-powered flight on a commercial scale is still many years away, but as this photo shows, its Kitty Hawk moment is in the books.

> Get your clothespins ready, it's Surströmming Day! For the uninitiated, that means we're in Sweden and cracking open this year's surströmming harvest to enjoy its putrid wonder. Surströmming is Baltic herring that's been caught in April and May, then lightly salted and allowed to ferment. Beginning in the 1940s, a royal ordinance forbade the selling of Surströmming before the third Thursday in August to prevent incompletely fermented fish from being sold. The ordinance is no longer on the books, but the tradition holds.
> 
> Swedes indulge in fermented herring from bloated cans that most insist should be opened outside and preferably underwater. That's the recommended way to alleviate the stench from what some call the world's worst-smelling food. You may have seen popular 'challenge' videos of people trying to brave the experience and failing miserably. That's part of the fun, even if those videos are not the best representations of a true surströmming feast.
> 
> In today's photo, we're visiting a small fishing village on the island of Källö-Knippla in Gothenburg's northern archipelago. People there today might enjoy some surströmming on top of tunnbröd (flatbread). It's common to cover the fish in red onions, sour cream, and dill and then wash it all down with a shot of booze, a beer, or even milk. The taste is said to be very sharp, savory, and even acidic. That is, if you can keep it down. One food critic famously said that 'the biggest challenge when eating surströmming is to vomit only after the first bite, as opposed to before.'

> Aquário Natural (Natural Aquarium, naturally) is the pristine, crystal-clear source of the Baía Bonita River and a highlight of the Baía Bonita Ecological Reserve. This remote inland region near the town of Bonito, Brazil, is a popular spot for ecotourism. A tour of the Aquário Natural offers a hike through the jungle followed by snorkeling with over 30 varieties of fish and gorgeous vegetation to marvel at. Other popular activities of the area include swimming in the Rio da Prata (Silver River), rappelling 236 feet down into the waters of the Anhumas Abyss, and walking through the treetops on the suspended steel walkway of the Circuito Arvorismo (Trees Circuit).
> 
> The underwater scene in today's image of plants and tetra fish was photographed by Swiss artist Michel Roggo. Since 2010, Roggo has crisscrossed the world in search of the most beautiful freshwater environments. His work has taken him to 48 locations where he has taken more than 12,000 photographs. His projects highlight the need to protect unsullied locations and to safeguard the world's wetlands and freshwater ecosystems.

> To really get the feel for today's photo, stop what you're doing, put your hands in the air, and imagine yourself plunging downhill at 50 miles an hour. Screaming is optional. It's National Roller Coaster Day and we're waiting in line at Morey's Piers in Wildwood, New Jersey, for our ride on the Great White. A hybrid wooden and steel coaster, it's been in operation since 1996 and reaches its highest point 110 feet above the ground. Coaster enthusiasts point out the ride's dip under the pier shortly after the start as one of its highlights. It's also noted for a portion of the ride swinging out over the nearby beach.
> 
> Roller coasters have come a long way since their early days beginning in the 17th century as Russian sled rides. Eventually called Russian Mountains, those original rides were just tall, wooden ramps covered in ice. When the concept made its way to the much warmer France, the sleds rolled across the tracks on wooden rollers, hence the name 'roller coaster.' Coasters saw another advancement in the 1870s when a Pennsylvania mining company built a downhill gravity railroad to transport coal. Its train cars held double duty by giving thrill rides to tourists during down time.
> 
> By the 1920s, coasters had entered their 'golden age.' New construction techniques allowed designers to build them taller, longer, and faster, drawing crowds to newly opened amusement parks around the world. These days, the United States alone has about 760 roller coasters, and thrill seekers take them on roughly 1.7 billion rides per year. Aieeeeee!

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> At 8 miles in circumference, the Chittorgarh Fort is one of the largest forts in India, a nation with scores of ancient and medieval fortresses. For starters there are seven massive gates from which to enter. Inside you'll find four palaces and 19 temples. At one time there were almost 100 bodies of water, most of them ponds fed by natural catchment and rainfall, although now there are only 20. Chittorgarh ('garh' means 'fort,' so it's also known as Chittor Fort) is so old, no one is sure exactly when it was built, although reports of its earliest capture go back to the 8th century. It is one of six large forts in the northwestern state of Rajasthan referred to as the Hill Forts of Rajasthan, all of them collectively designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. We're featuring this important and ancient complex on India's 75th Independence Day, one of India's three national holidays.
> 
> On August 15, 1947, India officially broke free of Great Britain and became a sovereign and democratic nation with the speedy passage of the Indian Independence Act. The paperwork might have been fast, but the struggle for independence from British rule lasted 90 years and cost many Indian lives. The British controlled the Indian subcontinent for nearly 200 years, after winning the decisive Battle of Plassey in 1757. The victory allowed the English East India Company to eventually exercise control over most of the rest of the Indian subcontinent, Burma, and Afghanistan. East India remained the supreme authority in India for a century until 1857 when a massive rebellion by civilians and Indian soldiers against the company was suppressed, resulting in direct British rule, referred to as the British raj.
> 
> The ensuing decades saw the formation of the Indian National Congress, the rise of Indian nationalism, various armed rebellions, and many acts of civil disobedience led by Mahatma Gandhi and others, before independence was finally achieved. While India as we know it is still a very young nation, the Chittor Fort reminds us the land and people that created modern India have endured and thrived for millennia.
