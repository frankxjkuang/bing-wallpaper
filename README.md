<summary>Description</summary>

> Glimmering in aquamarine tones, Lake Louise rests amid the Canadian Rockies in Alberta's Banff National Park. The Indigenous Nakoda people refer to the lake as Ho-run-num-nay, meaning 'lake of the little fishes.' It was later renamed by settlers, inspired by Britain's Princess Louise, whose husband was governor general of Canada between 1878 and 1883. The adjoining hamlet is also called Lake Louise and, at an elevation of almost 5,200 feet, is Canada's highest community.
> 
> This glacial lake is accessible throughout the year via the Trans-Canada Highway, and visitors enjoy hiking in the summer, skiing in the winter, and incredible mountain views at any time of the year.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Martin Luther King Jr. Day serves as a reminder not only of the man, but also of his mission. He stood for advances in civil rights, nonviolent resistance, and a dream of racial harmony. In 1983, the third Monday of January was made a federal holiday to mark his birthday, which was on January 15. It's the only federal holiday that's designated as a national day of service and the 'day on, not a day off' continues to inspire unity, progress, and the ongoing struggle for equality.
> 
> The Stone of Hope statue stands tall at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial, next to the National Mall in Washington, DC. It was created by the sculptor Lei Yixin and Dr. King's words are displayed around the memorial, urging us to continue the journey toward a better, more equitable tomorrow. The statue itself was inspired by a line from Dr. King's 1963 'I Have a Dream' speech: 'With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.'

<summary>Description</summary>

> An elegant creature for a majestic setting. These whooper swans, gliding on the mirror-like surface of Japan's Lake Kussharo, are close relatives of North America's trumpeter swans. Named for their loud call, whooper swans are one of the world's heaviest flying birds, weighing up to around 30 pounds and boasting wingspans of between 7 and 9 feet. Whooper swans are found across Eurasia and are Finland's national bird, spending their breeding season there before migrating to warmer areas for winter. All that travel doesn't ruin their relationships—these waterfowl form strong, monogamous pairs that can last for life.

Make a few stops along the way to get the best views of the rainforests and waterfalls that line the route. Popular attractions include the Waikamoi Ridge Trail, the easily accessible Twin Falls, and the black sands of Wai'ānapanapa State Park.

> Just a few miles north of South Korea's capital city of Seoul, Bukhansan National Park is a retreat for city dwellers and international visitors. Forests and ancient temples sit side-by-side in the park, beneath the three granite peaks of Bukhan Mountain, or Bukhansan. Among the park's ridges and valleys, water deer, wild boar, chipmunks, and squirrels roam freely. A careful ear might pick out the rat-a-tat of woodpeckers or the chirpy melody of songbirds perched in the trees. The park also boasts Bukhansanseong Fortress, whose current structure was completed in 1711.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Ready for a next-level staring contest? Don’t worry, you're unlikely to come face to face with a Eurasian lynx like this one, padding through the snow on our homepage. This elusive predator prowls around the forests of northern Europe and Siberia and the hills and mountains of Central Asia, often unnoticed by humans. Their low calls can be heard by other lynx, and they are primarily active at night, dawn, and dusk, although they can hunt by day if needed. These solitary hunters have keen senses and remarkable agility, able to climb trees and jump more than 6 feet straight up to catch prey. In temperate forests, they mainly dine out on rabbits, hares, marmots, and other small mammals, although they can take on prey as large as deer.
