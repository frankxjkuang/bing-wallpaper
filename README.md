<summary>Description</summary>

> Hungary is a country blessed with stunning landscapes and a host of historic castles. From the opulent Buda Castle in Budapest, with its commanding views of the Danube, to Eger Castle, renowned for its heroic defense against the Turks, each site has a story to tell.
> 
> Our homepage image shows one such stronghold, Füzér Castle, which crowns the Zemplén Mountains near Hungary's northern border and dates back to the 13th century. Perched at an elevation of over 1,800 feet above sea level, this castle stands on a mountain of volcanic origin. Here, within its ancient stone walls, the crown of Hungary was hidden following the country's defeat by the Ottoman Empire in the 1526 Battle of Mohács. After years of ruin, the castle's chapel was restored in 2016, and the keep was rebuilt to its former glory.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Imagine traveling for nearly two years across plains, mountains, and forests and finally arriving at this setting, where the mighty Columbia River empties into the Pacific near present-day Astoria, Oregon. That is the sight that greeted explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark in 1805 at the halfway point of their legendary 8,000-mile North American expedition that originated near St. Louis.
> 
> The expedition's success opened the way for further exploration and development of the Pacific Northwest and by 1811, Fort Astoria, the first US-owned settlement on the West Coast, was established. Oregon became the 33rd state in 1859. The Astoria-Megler Bridge opened in 1966, the final piece connecting Los Angeles to Olympia, Washington, via US Route 101.
> 
> Water from seven states and two Canadian provinces flows through the Columbia, passing under the 4-mile structure, the longest continuous truss bridge in North America.

> Let's all slow down to celebrate International Sloth Day, the perfect time to take things easy. With that friendly smile, you might think this pygmy three-toed sloth is inviting you to hang out, but these animals are not easy to find. Also known as the monk sloth or dwarf sloth, the species lives exclusively on a small island off Panama's coast, Isla Escudo de Veraguas. Pygmy three-toed sloths are much smaller than other kinds of sloths, at about 20 inches long, and they weigh less than 8 pounds. Sadly, this species is classified as critically endangered. International Sloth Day aims to raise awareness of the planet's slowest mammal and help them to survive and thrive in the wild, at their own pace.

> When the river floods, it becomes a photographer's paradise, awash with flowering lilies. These farmers in Long An province are pictured wading in waist-deep to harvest the long-stemmed plants, which will be bundled up for sale. The lilies contribute to the local economy as the stems are edible and the plant can be brewed into tea or used for decoration. Here flooding is a part of life, bringing nutrients from upstream which enrich fields and help these flowers to grow, painting the Mekong River in stunning shades of pink and white.

The US paid $7.2 million, or about 2 cents per acre, for the land, adding more than 586,0000 square miles to its territory. Today the date is known as Alaska Day and honors the history, untamed wilderness, and unwavering resilience of the state.
