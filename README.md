> Life on Earth, from tiny bacteria to towering trees, is interconnected. International Day for Biological Diversity is about celebrating this web of life that keeps our planet thriving. Biodiversity ties into everything, from sustainable farming and clean water to climate action and disaster preparedness. A decline in biodiversity can increase the spread of zoonotic diseases—those transmitted from animals to humans. In contrast, protecting biodiversity strengthens our ability to prevent and respond to health crises like pandemics. Recognizing its crucial role for current and future generations, the United Nations observes this day each year to raise awareness and foster action for conserving the planet's biological treasures.

> Today's image features Madagascar's Avenue of the Baobabs. In the Menabe region of western Madagascar, Grandidier's baobabs line the unpaved Road No. 8. Also known as giant baobabs, they are the largest and most famous of Madagascar's baobab species. Locally known as renala or reniala (mother of the forest), these trees are remnants of the lush tropical forests that once covered this island country. Now, they stand alone as survivors of widespread deforestation. Though the area was declared a natural monument in 2015, these magnificent trees still face threats from further deforestation, rice field runoff, and seasonal fires.

> Legend says that it began with a single leaf drifting into a pot of boiling water in ancient China. Centuries later, tea is the second-most consumed drink in the world (after water). Today is International Tea Day, a global nod to this timeless beverage, established by the United Nations to recognize tea's role in reducing poverty and supporting sustainable development. It's a day to honor both the drink and the people who are part of this industry.
> 
> Tea harvesting is a delicate craft, rooted in tradition and influenced by geography. From the misty hills of Zhejiang province in China, pictured here, to the rolling estates of Assam in India, the process differs. Green tea leaves are sun-dried or steamed to preserve their freshness, while oolong and black teas undergo oxidation to develop complex, bold flavors. The result is a rich spectrum of taste, color, and aroma. China, India, Kenya, and Sri Lanka lead global tea production. Each country offers its own signature style: China with pu-erh and green teas, India with robust black blends, Kenya with CTC teas, and Sri Lanka with floral Ceylon. In every cup, you can taste the story of its origin, shaped by the land's soil, altitude, and climate.

> Honey bees may be small, but without them, your grocery list would be a lot shorter. No more berries, avocados, or even coffee. Alongside butterflies, bats, and hummingbirds, bees pollinate nearly 90% of the world's wild flowering plants and over 35% of the food crops we rely on. World Bee Day, marked every May 20, honors these vital pollinators and celebrates Anton Janša, a pioneer of modern beekeeping. Janša saw bees as the noblest of insects, an idea now backed by science.
> 
> Unfortunately, bee populations are in danger. Pesticide exposure, habitat loss, and climate change are driving their numbers down, threatening both global food security and biodiversity. The good news is that small actions can make a big difference. Support local beekeepers, plant pollinator-friendly flowers, and avoid chemical pesticides. And the next time you stir honey into your tea, remember the tiny worker behind that golden spoonful and why protecting this buzzing species matters more than ever.

> Drive up Mount Hamilton just east of San Jose, California, and immerse yourself in stunning views and rich history. The 19-mile Mount Hamilton Road is loved by cyclists and motorcyclists for its long climbs and sparse traffic. Built in 1875-76, the road was designed to transport materials to the Lick Observatory, the world's first permanently occupied mountaintop observatory. On a clear day, you can see as far as Yosemite National Park or the Sierra Nevada from the 4,265-foot summit.
> 
> Several rare species are endemic to this area, such as the Hamilton jewelflower and the tule elk. On the slopes of the mountain, you might encounter golden eagle nesting sites. Whether you're drawn to the thrill of the winding road or the views, Mount Hamilton will connect you with nature.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This International Museum Day, let's immerse ourselves in Raoul Dufy's 6,460 square-foot fresco. The 'La Fée Electricité' (The Spirit of Electricity) is housed at the Museum of Modern Art in Paris. This stunning artwork was created for the Pavilion of Light and Electricity at the 1937 International Exhibition of Art and Technology in Modern Life. The painting was inspired by the poem 'On the Nature of Things,' written by Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius. Raoul Dufy's work vividly depicts the evolution of electricity through two main themes: the history of electricity and its applications.
> 
> International Museum Day, celebrated annually on May 18, aims to raise awareness about the importance of museums in cultural exchange, enrichment, and mutual understanding. Since its inception in 1977, the event has grown to include over 37,000 museums across 158 countries. This year's theme, 'The Future of Museums in Rapidly Changing Communities,' invites us to reimagine the role of museums as essential connectors and drivers of innovation.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Pictured here is a spectacular view of a delta in the Venetian Lagoon, Italy. Spanning over 212 square miles, this lagoon is a rich mosaic of islands, mudflats, canals, and marshes, and it's one of the largest wetlands in the entire Mediterranean Basin. The lagoon isn't just a scenic wonder—it's a place steeped in history and innovation. Formed after the last Ice Age, it became a refuge for people fleeing invasions around the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476. In the centuries that followed, those early settlers began building what would eventually become the iconic city of Venice.
> 
> Today, the lagoon is still central to local life, supporting fishing, tourism, and even sustainable aquaculture. It's connected to the Adriatic Sea by three inlets and is famous for acqua alta, or 'high water,' when tides flood parts of Venice. From ancient refuge to modern marvel, the Venetian Lagoon is a reflection of how people and nature can shape a place together.

> Each year on the third Friday of May, people worldwide recognize Endangered Species Day—a day to celebrate, learn about, and act on behalf of at-risk wildlife. First launched in 2006 by the Endangered Species Coalition and conservationist David Robinson, this event inspires local and global efforts to protect threatened animals and their habitats.
> 
> The stunning bird featured in today's image is a great green macaw. Native to the tropical forests of Central and South America, this colorful parrot is critically endangered, with fewer than 1,000 individuals estimated to remain in the wild. These intelligent, social birds depend heavily on old-growth forests, particularly in places like Costa Rica, where they nest in almendro trees. Deforestation and habitat fragmentation remain their greatest threats. On May 16, let's join wildlife refuges, schools, and conservation groups in celebrating and supporting biodiversity. Every voice counts in protecting species that still have a fighting chance.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
