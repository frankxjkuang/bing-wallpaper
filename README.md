<summary>Description</summary>

> Step closer, and the details begin to speak—every stone, spire, and statue seems to hold a story of its own. Conceived in the late 19th century, the Hungarian Parliament Building was designed to reflect a nation's ambition, blending Gothic Revival elegance with distinctly Hungarian motifs. Architect Imre Steindl's vision took shape over two decades through the work of more than 1,000 craftsmen. Even the central dome, rising 315 feet (96 meters) high, carries meaning: the height honors the year of Hungary's millennium anniversary in 1896. Completed in 1904, the building still dominates Budapest's skyline as a powerful national symbol.
> 
> Step inside, and the richness deepens. Gold leaf shimmers across staircases and halls, while statues of rulers and national figures line the corridors, turning history into spectacle. Beyond its political role, the Parliament has become a cultural emblem—hosting state ceremonies, welcoming millions of visitors annually, and earning UNESCO World Heritage status. More than a landmark, it continues to tell Hungary's story through the details that first inspired its creation.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Each fall, Oregon's quiet waterways become seasonal waypoints for hooded mergansers—small diving ducks native to North America. They are agile divers, plunging beneath the surface to catch fish and other prey. Males, known as drakes, stand out with their fan-shaped white crests, dark heads, and chestnut-brown sides, while females, called hens, are brownish gray with smaller crests. Oregon's lakes and wetlands provide sheltered feeding grounds as these birds migrate or winter across the continent.
> 
> Among the six living merganser species, hooded mergansers are the second smallest. They are known for their striking courtship displays, where males raise their crests dramatically to attract mates, creating unmistakable shapes on still water. They nest in tree cavities near wetlands, and soon after hatching, ducklings leap to the ground to follow their mother to water. Classified as Least Concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List, their populations remain stable across their range. First described in 1758, their genus name, 'Lophodytes,' means 'crest diver' in Greek—a nod to both their plumage and underwater hunting skill.

> National Take a Hike Day is more than a date—it's an invitation to step away from screens and into the rhythm of nature. Created by the American Hiking Society, this day celebrates the simple act of walking under open skies and reminds us that health and happiness often begin with a single stride. Across 60,000 miles of US trails, hikers rediscover the quiet magic of forests, the strength in their own breath, and the promise of unspoiled landscapes.
> 
> And then there's Shenandoah National Park, Virginia's mountain jewel. Here, the Blue Ridge Mountains wear their finest colors—golden hickories, crimson maples, and oaks brushed in bronze. By November, the air turns crisp, and the last embers of fall cling to the hillsides like whispered secrets. Skyline Drive winds for 105 miles, offering vistas where clouds drift like thoughts across endless valleys. Trails—more than 500 miles of them—lead to places where waterfalls tumble and summits greet the horizon. Stony Man, Hawksbill, Dark Hollow Falls—each a poem written in stone and leaf, waiting for footsteps to rhyme with the wind.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In Lyon, France, you don't just walk through the city—you glide through it. The traboules, a network of hidden passageways threading between courtyards and buildings, turn a simple stroll into a treasure hunt. They were the original shortcuts, allowing residents to dodge rain, carry goods, or move discreetly through the medieval quarters. Today, they're less about practicality and more about discovery. These passages date back to the fourth century but became essential during the Renaissance, when silk traders used them to shuttle delicate fabrics safely from workshops to the river without braving the weather. Later, during World War II, Resistance fighters used the traboules as escape routes.
> 
> Most of Lyon's traboules are tucked away in the Vieux Lyon and Croix-Rousse districts. Push open what looks like an ordinary wooden door, and you might step into a courtyard with spiral staircases, arched galleries, and stone corridors that snake between buildings. Some passages are public, some private, and all of them blur the line between indoors and outdoors. Walking a traboule is like flipping through the city's footnotes. You're right in the heart of a living neighborhood, yet moving through centuries of history.

<summary>Description</summary>

> If you think the alphabet is straightforward, Japan's Irohazaka Road in Nikko will twist that belief right out of you. Named after the old Japanese syllabary 'Iroha,' this mountain pass once had 48 hairpin bends—each curve matched to a character of the alphabet. Today, it's a pair of separate one-way roads—one goes up, the other comes down, and both make drivers feel as if they're spelling out a story with every turn.
> 
> Fall is when Irohazaka truly shows off, as captured in today's image. From late October to early November, maple reds, ginkgo golds, and larch yellows spill down the slopes. The winding route also leads to some of Nikko's greatest hits. Climb up, and you'll reach the Akechidaira Plateau. Here, a ropeway gives you sweeping views of Lake Chuzenji and the powerful Kegon Falls. At the top, Lake Chuzenji offers a calm contrast to the dizzying drive, while the waterfall roars below. Centuries ago, pilgrims took this same route to reach sacred shrines and temples. Today, travelers follow in their tracks, though probably with more camera clicks than chants.

> November isn't just about turkey dinners and pumpkin pie—it's also Manatee Awareness Month, when we show some love to the ocean's chillest stars. Forget dolphins doing flips or sharks stealing headlines—manatees win hearts by doing, well, almost nothing. And that's the charm.
> 
> Manatees are found in the warm coastal waters of the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, the Amazon Basin, and West Africa. They can weigh up to 1,200 pounds, yet their diet is strictly vegetarian. These whiskered mammals are slow swimmers in a fast-paced world. They cruise at around 5 miles per hour—great for relaxing, not so great when speedboats come charging through. That's why 'no-wake zones,' or sections of waterways with a strict speed limit, are there to keep manatees safe.
> 
> Despite the 'sea cow' nickname, these marine animals are closer genetically to elephants than cattle. And like elephants, they're gentle giants with no interest in picking fights. Their biggest battles are against human-made threats: pollution, habitat loss, and boat collisions. So, what can you do? Support conservation, spread the word, and if you're boating in their waters, channel your inner manatee and take it slow.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Of all the plants on Earth, the quiver tree looks the most like a vision from the future. Found in Southern Africa, including parts of Namibia, these striking giants are not true trees but a species of aloe adapted to life under the desert's scorching sun. Their thick trunks store water, while their branches reflect heat, helping them endure harsh conditions. Reaching up to 23 feet in height, with some living for more than 100 years, quiver trees are also vital to their ecosystem. They offer rare perches and nesting sites for birds in landscapes where few other trees exist.
> 
> The name 'quiver' comes from the Indigenous San people, who once hollowed out the branches to craft lightweight arrow holders, or quivers. The Quiver Tree Forest near Keetmanshoop is a national monument and one of Namibia's most photographed sites. With some of the clearest skies on Earth, the desert provides a perfect backdrop for stargazing. In today's image, quiver trees stand silhouetted against the Milky Way. Though climate shifts are altering their natural range, these trees remain a symbol of Namibia's rugged beauty—and a reminder of how nature adapts in the most imaginative ways.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
