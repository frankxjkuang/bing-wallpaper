> Pollinator Week is in full bloom! This year's celebration takes place from June 16 to 22. It shines a spotlight on the birds, bats, bees, butterflies, beetles, and other animals that help pollinate nearly 90% of flowering plants—including many of the fruits, vegetables, and nuts we love. Featured here is the Asian swallowtail, captured on a red spider lily. Found across Northeast Asia and even parts of Hawaii, this striking butterfly uses its keen color vision to find flowers, especially those from citrus families. While it is common and not currently threatened, its role as a pollinator is no less important.
> 
> This year's theme, 'Pollinators Weave Connections,' reminds us how pollinators shape both ecosystems and culture. Join in by planting pollinator-friendly flowers, avoiding pesticides, and helping protect these vital creatures to ensure a healthy future for both people and the planet.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Before you hit the beach, you'll hear it—the rustle of leaves in salty air, the creak of twisted trunks, the hush of an old world. Welcome to the maritime forest of Cumberland Island National Seashore on the southernmost stretch of Georgia's Atlantic coast. Salt spray, sandy soil, hurricanes? The trees here stand their ground. Live oaks bend but don't break. Saw palmettos crowd the ground like leafy bodyguards, while Spanish moss hangs from branches like nature's fringe. This maritime forest is one of the best remaining examples of this rare habitat in the United States. Thanks to its national seashore status, the island has been spared from the concrete creep seen on other coastlines.
> 
> What you see here is the forest as it's been for centuries—a few ruins from the days of Scottish American industrialist Thomas Carnegie and the occasional feral horses grazing through. The horses are descendants of animals left by settlers long gone, and they're now unofficial mascots of the area. Alongside them, you might spot armadillos digging through the undergrowth, woodpeckers hammering tree trunks, or raccoons engaging in tiny heists. Trails like the South End Trail or the Parallel Trail weave through dense foliage, sometimes giving glimpses of marshes or hidden historic sites. So next time you think of the coast, remember: the real drama isn't always on the shore. Sometimes, it's rooted just beyond the dunes.

> They've got built-in helmets, a slow-and-steady vibe, and zero interest in your deadlines. Sea turtles, like this one photographed in Fernando de Noronha, Brazil, have been cruising Earth's oceans since before T-rex was a thing. Today, World Sea Turtle Day, is about recognizing these ancient navigators and the role they play in keeping our oceans in balance. Why June 16? The date marks the birthday of American conservationist Archie Carr, known as the father of sea turtle conservation. His work laid the foundation for understanding turtle behavior and fighting for their protection.
> 
> There are seven species of sea turtles gliding through the world's oceans: green, loggerhead, hawksbill, leatherback, Kemp's ridley, olive ridley, and flatback. Most of them are either endangered or vulnerable. These creatures often mistake floating plastic for jellyfish and eat it; fishing nets unintentionally trap and drown them; and rising temperatures are making most hatchlings female, which has a negative impact on biodiversity. So today, lend a hand to a turtle—or better yet, keep plastic out of the ocean. They've carried the weight of history on their backs; the least we can do is shoulder our share of the responsibility.

<summary>Description</summary>

> For Father's Day, we're featuring a male lesser rhea (aka Darwin's rhea) with his chicks in Torres del Paine National Park, Patagonia, Chile. From the moment the chicks hatch, the male lesser rhea takes full charge—guiding them through the brush, communicating with gentle whistles, and sheltering them under his wings in times of danger or cold. Remarkably, he often adopts lost chicks, raising a mixed-age brood. For nearly 6 months, this bird father teaches and protects the chicks, with many staying close until maturity. Talk about going above and beyond for your kids!

> Every June 14, we celebrate national pride and the fabric that unites us—the American flag. It was only when Congress passed the Flag Resolution on June 14, 1777, that the Stars and Stripes design was adopted as the official flag of the United States. To commemorate this historic milestone, then-president Woodrow Wilson proclaimed June 14 as Flag Day in 1916—a tribute to the banner that came to represent America's identity, values, and unity.
> 
> The current 50-star design wasn't created by a professional, but by Robert Heft, a high school student in Lancaster, Ohio. He came up with the design for a high school history project where students had to update the national flag to recognize the new states of Alaska and Hawaii. Heft only got a B-minus on his creation. But after it was sent off to Washington, DC, and selected by President Eisenhower as the new national flag in 1959, he got that grade up to an A.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Not far from São Miguel Island in the Azores archipelago of Portugal, you'll find Vila Franca Islet. This uninhabited green islet sits quietly just south of the town of Vila Franca do Campo. Beneath its serene surface, this gem holds a lively past. First documented in 1537, around the time when settlers from São Miguel began expanding westward, Vila Franca Islet has played many roles throughout its history. It has served as a military fort, a port, a vineyard site, and even a lookout for whale-watching.
> 
> Once a volcanic crater, this islet is now a protected nature reserve teeming with unique marine life, including bird species like Bulwer's petrel, little egret, and sooty tern. The unique shape of this tiny island, sculpted by nature, makes it truly special. At its heart lies an almost perfectly circular lagoon, linked to the sea by a narrow channel called Boquete. Since the opening faces north toward São Miguel, it shields the lagoon from ocean waves and forms a calm natural harbor with a sandy beach. It's no wonder the spot is a favorite for swimmers: from June to October, ferries run daily between the town and the islet. Access is limited to 400 visitors a day—do you want to be one of them?

<summary>Description</summary>

> They say everything's bigger in Texas—and Big Bend National Park has been living up to the slogan since forever. Efforts to preserve this 801,163-acre area of West Texas began in the 1930s and culminated in its official designation as a park on June 12, 1944. Big Bend remains one of the most remote and least-visited national parks in the country. It's not just one landscape, it's three: the Chihuahuan Desert, the Chisos Mountains (pictured here), and the Rio Grande. Big Bend sits on the US–Mexico border, and its history reflects that blend. Indigenous peoples, Spanish explorers, ranchers, miners, and modern travelers have all left their footprints. Petroglyphs, ruins, and old trails show the land's story began long before it became a park.
> 
> The park is home to over 1,200 species of plants, more than 450 species of birds, and a wide variety of mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. You might spot a roadrunner zipping across the dirt, or a bobcat silently slipping through the underbrush. Additionally, it has been designated as one of the best dark-sky parks in America, offering views of the Milky Way, planets, and constellations.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
