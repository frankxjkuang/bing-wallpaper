> Towering temples, moss-covered ruins, and enchanting forests can all be found in the ancient site of Angkor in Cambodia, once the center of the powerful Khmer Empire. Pictured on our homepage is the North Gate of Angkor Thom, the 'Great City' within Angkor, built in the 12th century. Strolling through Angkor Thom's intricate ruins, gates, and Bayon Temple, with its 216 gigantic smiling stone faces, is like stepping into an adventure movie. Angkor's star attraction, Angkor Wat, is the world's largest religious monument—spread across 402 acres—and a masterpiece of Khmer architecture. It was initially constructed as a Hindu temple before becoming a Buddhist site. So, if you're looking for a blend of history, art, and nature, this UNESCO World Heritage Site guarantees an unforgettable journey into the past.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The windiest, coldest, and driest continent on Earth—Antarctica—was officially discovered in 1820. In the following decades, several countries organized expeditions to reach and explore the Antarctic ice sheets. The southernmost continent had no indigenous population and various nations claimed ownership. But in 1959, 12 countries signed the Antarctic Treaty, banning military activities and setting Antarctica aside for scientific research. Today, we celebrate the anniversary of this treaty, which now has 56 parties.
> 
> From suspended clouds of ice crystals to a subglacial, iron oxide-rich lake that seeps into a blood-red waterfall, this polar desert is full of natural wonders. Its massive ice sheet stores about 70% of the world's fresh water, enough to raise sea levels by more than 200 feet if it were to melt entirely.

> Scotland's fantastical landscapes are steeped in folklore and myths. The Old Man of Storr—a 164-foot rocky pinnacle on the Isle of Skye—is no exception. So named because it is said to resemble a craggy man when viewed from the right angle, it has long inspired tales of giants and magic. The Old Man towers over the Trotternish Ridge, a 20-mile-long landslip that is home to many stunning and strange rock formations, each with their own stories.
> 
> It is also a suitably stunning site to toast Saint Andrew, who was named as Scotland's patron saint when the country declared its independence in 1320. The celebration of St. Andrew's Day was popularized by Scottish people in the US who wanted to connect to their roots. However, Scotland is not the only country to celebrate the saint. From Romania to Barbados, many nations celebrate the historic figure, applying their own traditions. Are you celebrating today?

> As December approaches, New York gears up for a sparkling spectacle. On November 29, the Rockefeller Center Tree Lighting will bring you festive vibes. The roots of this holiday tradition go back to 1931, when builders put up a balsam fir to show gratitude for their jobs amid the bleakness of the Great Depression. That tree was decorated with paper garlands and tin cans and in 1933 the first tree-lighting ceremony took place. Today, this towering Norway spruce is adorned with over 50,000 multicolored LED lights and topped with a Swarovski crystal star. The illumination of the 80-foot tree is a full-blown extravaganza with musical performances and celebrity sightings. Its mesmerizing glow marks the official arrival of the holiday season in the city that never sleeps, and you don't want to miss it!

> As we get caught up in the hustle and bustle of gift shopping and festive decorations, it's good to remember the true spirit of times like these: generosity and kindness. That's where Giving Tuesday comes in. This annual holiday on the first Tuesday after Thanksgiving was created by the United Nations Foundation and New York's 92nd Street Y—a cultural organization and community center—in 2012. Their vision was to make a difference by providing joy to everyone through acts of charity. Generosity is something we can all practice, whether by volunteering at a non-profit organization, shelter or food bank, donating to a charity, or simply giving a voice to people in need in your community. So, let's jump on board with the millions of kind souls, shake hands, and share warm wishes far and wide!

<summary>Description</summary>

> From its source in Colombia, the Río Negro flows about 1,400 miles to become one of the largest tributaries of the Amazon River at the Meeting of Waters in Manaus, Brazil. It is also the largest blackwater river in the world, its water stained by decomposing organic matter that seeps in from swamps. These slow-moving, dark waters beautifully reflect the colors of the sky, including the rainbows which form over the Amazon basin, as seen here. The river also plays a crucial role in the ecosystem, as the home of many plants and animals, including the critically endangered Brazilian barefaced tamarin, the giant river otter, and nearly 700 species of fish.

> This doe and fawn are fallow deer, known for their striking chestnut brown coats with white spots, which typically darken to gray in the winter. Fallow deer are native to Europe and parts of Asia and are a common sight in England, where they were introduced by the Normans in the 11th century. During the autumn rutting season, mothers stay close to their young while the males, which have broad palmate antlers, spar to establish their dominance. Our homepage doe and fawn are pictured in 850-acre Bradgate Park in Leicestershire, a medieval deer park set within woodlands and a beautiful landscape in England's East Midlands region.
