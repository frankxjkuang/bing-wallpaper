<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to Kenya's Maasai Mara National Reserve, where some of its most iconic inhabitants are out for an evening stroll. Wildebeests, also known as gnus, are social animals which often form large herds. There are two types: black wildebeests and blue wildebeests and it is the latter which take part in the famous Great Migration, one of the world's greatest wildlife spectacles.
> 
> This typically starts in January or February and sees more than a million wildebeests, along with large herds of zebras and other species, migrate from the Serengeti in neighboring Tanzania to the Maasai Mara in search of water and greener pastures. They arrive in Kenya from late July and stay until November when they start moving south again, a round trip of some 500 miles. Tourists flock to the Maasai Mara to witness this incredible natural spectacle.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we're exploring a place of otherworldly beauty: the Jöriseen, a group of alpine lakes near Davos, Switzerland. On sunny days, the lakes glow an ethereal blue, contrasting with the dark, jagged Silvretta Alps that encircle them. The sunlight is reflected in the water by 'rock flour'—silt-sized rock particles generated from the grinding of bedrock by glaciers.
> 
> The Silvretta Alps sit across the Swiss-Austrian border and are themselves surrounded by glaciers in an area known as the 'Blue Silvretta.' If you want to enjoy these stunning views up close, you'll have to work for it. Bring your best hiking boots, plenty of water, and some strong legs.

> This stunning structure is the stone pavilion housing the massive Korean Bell of Friendship in Los Angeles, a city with a large Korean American population. It's ringing in Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month, which starts today. The month was chosen in recognition of the first documented arrival of Japanese immigrants, on May 7, 1843, and the completion of the transcontinental railroad by more than 20,000 Asian immigrants on May 10, 1869.
> 
> Back to that intricately decorated bronze bell. It was a gift to the city from South Korea to mark the US bicentennial in 1976 and is modeled on the largest bell cast in Korean history, the Divine Bell of King Seongdeok, made in 771. Both versions are among the largest bells in the world.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Born in the Black communities of New Orleans, jazz music quickly caught on outside the Big Easy and became an international sensation. Due to its improvisational nature, jazz never stays the same, fusing with other cultures and genres to create styles such as Afro-Cuban, Latin, and Indo Jazz. UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador and jazz pianist Herbie Hancock created International Jazz Day to celebrate the global genre, first held in 2012 with events in New York, Paris, and New Orleans. We hope you celebrate by putting on your favorite jazz record, or if you can swing it, visit New Orleans' legendary jazz venue, Preservation Hall, seen in our photo here.

> Get your telescope and star map app ready because it's Astronomy Day! Doug Berger, then president of the Astronomical Association of Northern California, created Astronomy Day in 1973 to get more people interested in the wonders of space. He set up telescopes on street corners, malls, and parks to give people a chance to see the stars firsthand.
> 
> Early astronomers lacked the means to view celestial objects beyond those which could be seen by the naked eye. But they still made major discoveries, such as calculating the size and distance of the moon, affirming the sun as the center of our solar system, and predicting the movement of stars relative to the seasons. Today we have sophisticated telescopes, from the orbiting James Webb Space Telescope to the portable ones you'll find in use at International Dark Sky Parks, including Joshua Tree National Park, seen in our photo. With such ground-breaking technology at our disposal, astronomers can boldly go where no human eyes have gone before.

<summary>Description</summary>

> We're celebrating Arbor Day with some of Yosemite's most famous residents, the giant sequoia trees of Mariposa Grove. The day champions the planting and preservation of trees and can trace its roots back more than 150 years. In 1872, Nebraska City News editor Julius Sterling Morton proposed a day for locals to plant trees, and the idea grew and grew. Today all 50 states celebrate Arbor Day, most commonly on the last Friday in April, although different states might observe it on the best dates for tree planting in their area.
> 
> Giant sequoias, like the ones on our homepage, have been around for a very long time. Geological evidence suggests that they are the third-longest-lived tree species in the world. There are hundreds of them in Yosemite's Mariposa Grove, including the famous Grizzly Giant, which is estimated to be about 3,000 years old. Let's hope it is around for thousands of Arbor Days to come.

> Located a few miles offshore on the Texas Gulf Coast, Padre Island is the largest of the state's string of barrier islands. At 113 miles in length, it is also the longest barrier island in the world. Barrier islands usually run parallel to the coast and, as the name suggests, serve as the mainland's first line of defense against storms.
> 
> Since the Port Mansfield Channel was built in the early 1960s, Padre Island has been split into two parts, South Padre Island, pictured here, and North Padre Island. Connected by a bridge to the shore, the resort town of South Padre Island draws in thousands of visitors every year for swimming, boating, fishing, or simply lounging on the beach. Others come for the trail of elaborate sandcastles scattered across the island, created by professional artists.
