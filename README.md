> As we get caught up in the hustle and bustle of gift shopping and festive decorations, it's good to remember the true spirit of times like these: generosity and kindness. That's where Giving Tuesday comes in. This annual holiday on the first Tuesday after Thanksgiving was created by the United Nations Foundation and New York's 92nd Street Y—a cultural organization and community center—in 2012. Their vision was to make a difference by providing joy to everyone through acts of charity. Generosity is something we can all practice, whether by volunteering at a non-profit organization, shelter or food bank, donating to a charity, or simply giving a voice to people in need in your community. So, let's jump on board with the millions of kind souls, shake hands, and share warm wishes far and wide!

<summary>Description</summary>

> From its source in Colombia, the Río Negro flows about 1,400 miles to become one of the largest tributaries of the Amazon River at the Meeting of Waters in Manaus, Brazil. It is also the largest blackwater river in the world, its water stained by decomposing organic matter that seeps in from swamps. These slow-moving, dark waters beautifully reflect the colors of the sky, including the rainbows which form over the Amazon basin, as seen here. The river also plays a crucial role in the ecosystem, as the home of many plants and animals, including the critically endangered Brazilian barefaced tamarin, the giant river otter, and nearly 700 species of fish.

> This doe and fawn are fallow deer, known for their striking chestnut brown coats with white spots, which typically darken to gray in the winter. Fallow deer are native to Europe and parts of Asia and are a common sight in England, where they were introduced by the Normans in the 11th century. During the autumn rutting season, mothers stay close to their young while the males, which have broad palmate antlers, spar to establish their dominance. Our homepage doe and fawn are pictured in 850-acre Bradgate Park in Leicestershire, a medieval deer park set within woodlands and a beautiful landscape in England's East Midlands region.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Built on a hill and surrounded on three sides by the Tagus River, the Spanish city of Toledo is a UNESCO World Heritage Site packed with history. Its towering Alcázar fortress and impressive Gothic cathedral dominate the skyline, but the city is also home to mosques and synagogues. Toledo bears strong cultural influences from the Moors, who ruled here for centuries, following their arrival in Spain in 711. It was known as the City of the Three Cultures during the Middle Ages, when its Christian, Muslim, and Jewish communities coexisted harmoniously. Toledo has been the home of sword making since Roman times and is also famous for its marzipan. In the 16th century, the city was home to the famous painter El Greco, who was inspired to create some of his greatest masterpieces here.

> Imagine spending the day hiking amid these moss-covered trees instead of frantically checking items off your holiday shopping list. Welcome to Green Friday, the environmental alternative to Black Friday. The aim is to encourage people to make ethical shopping choices—or to refrain from shopping altogether and embrace nature instead.
> 
> A good place to start is the Hall of Mosses at Olympic National Park, in Washington's Hoh Rain Forest. This fantastical landscape is a temperate rainforest with an enchanting loop trail through mosses gracefully draped over majestic spruces and hemlocks. Bring a jacket though; this forest is the wettest in the contiguous United States with an annual rainfall of nearly 130 inches. No wonder it's so green!

<summary>Description</summary>

> While people gather across the country for feasts of turkey, mashed potatoes, and stuffing, you may wonder about the origins of Thanksgiving. Early English settlers had plenty to be thankful for, whether surviving the long voyage to America or the first harsh winters. Written records tell of an early thanksgiving shared between Plymouth Pilgrims and Wampanoag Native Americans, who provided a harvest of corn, deer, and turkey. There were many early days of thanksgiving, but an official, national celebration was proclaimed by George Washington in 1789, and has been a part of our holiday season ever since. Today, we wish you good company and plenty of things to be thankful for. Happy Thanksgiving!

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today's image gives us a glimpse of beautiful Grand Teton National Park, in our least populous state, Wyoming. The park, established in 1929, encompasses lakes, the Snake River, and the Teton Range, famed for its series of sharp, jagged peaks. Bring your binoculars with you, and if it's summertime, be on the lookout for pronghorn, which travel about 150 miles to get there from Wyoming's Upper Green River Basin. They aren't the only creatures to visit seasonally; elk and bison are also summer visitors. These migrations play a vital role in the ecosystem of Grand Teton National Park. The animals help disperse seeds and are also food for predators.
