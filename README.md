> Today is Tolkien Reading Day. It's a time to dust off well-worn copies of 'The Lord of the Rings' or 'The Hobbit,' and journey once more into the lands of elves, dwarves, and one particularly famous ring. But why this date? March 25 is the day the One Ring was destroyed, bringing down Sauron and ending his dark reign. The observation was launched in 2003 to encourage people to explore J.R.R. Tolkien's works. Schools, libraries, and fans worldwide take part, reading passages aloud, discussing favorite moments, and diving into the rich lore of Middle-earth. Some go all out with themed events, cosplay, and even second breakfasts—because what better way to honor Tolkien than by feasting like a hobbit?
> 
> Tolkien's writings extend far beyond Middle-earth. His academic work on language and mythology, his poetry, and lesser-known stories like in 'The Silmarillion' offer plenty for curious readers. Not sure where to start? Try reading the iconic 'All That is Gold Does Not Glitter' poem, revisiting Bilbo's riddle battle with Gollum, or even touring a hobbit-hole at Hobbiton Movie Set in Waikato, New Zealand, like the one pictured here.

> Desert elephants, found in Namibia and Mali, are African bush elephants that have adapted to the harsh conditions of the Namib and Sahara deserts. These extremely arid regions receive less than 2.75 inches of annual rainfall. Compared to other bush elephants, desert elephants have longer legs, broader feet, and slightly smaller bodies. These resilient herbivores migrate between waterholes, following ancient routes based on seasonal food and water availability. Male desert elephants often roam alone over vast areas, while female-led family groups stay near rivers, where food is more plentiful. Their incredible adaptability is showcased by their ability to travel long distances, sometimes 43 miles in a single night, to find their favorite myrrh bushes.

> Today, we celebrate World Meteorological Day, commemorating the founding of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1950. For the annual event, the WMO places emphasis on a different pressing topic each year. The slogan of 2025, 'Closing the early warning gap together,' highlights the importance of timely weather alerts and early action.
> 
> Pictured here is awe-inspiring anvil crawler lightning in Nebraska, a state renowned for its tornadoes and thunderstorms, typically during spring and summer. Anvil crawlers are tree-like lightning discharges that move horizontally. Nebraska's location in the Great Plains makes it a hotspot for storm activity. Thanks to the WMO's advancements in meteorology, we can better predict and respond to these dramatic weather events, safeguarding lives and property.

> March 22 is World Water Day, a United Nations initiative highlighting the importance of fresh water and its conservation. This day raises awareness about the global water crisis and promotes actions to ensure clean water for all. Fresh water is vital—not just for drinking, but for ecosystems, agriculture, and cultural heritage.
> 
> A stunning example of nature's freshwater wonders is Cenote Nicte Ha in Tulum, Mexico, seen in today's image. A cenote is a natural sinkhole that arises from the collapse of limestone bedrock, exposing groundwater. Named after the Mayan words for flower (nicte) and water (ha), this open cenote is known for its turquoise waters and abundant water lilies. Sunlight filters through its surface, supporting aquatic life. For the ancient Maya, cenotes were sacred portals to the underworld and vital water sources in the Yucatán Peninsula. With a maximum depth of approximately 32 feet, Cenote Nicte Ha is a popular spot for snorkeling and diving and offers a glimpse into an ancient and fragile ecosystem.

> March 21 marks the International Day of Forests, a global observance aimed at celebrating the vital role forests play in supporting biodiversity and combating climate change. First established by the United Nations in 2013, this day encourages worldwide efforts, such as tree-planting campaigns, to raise awareness about the importance of forests and trees for future generations.
> 
> One of the most breathtaking places to observe the richness of forests is the Danum Valley Conservation Area in Sabah on the Malaysian island of Borneo, starring in today's image. This 169-square-mile sanctuary is home to an ancient rainforest, teeming with rare species like Bornean orangutans, clouded leopards, and over 270 bird species. In addition to its incredible biodiversity, the Danum Valley is also a haven for researchers, with long-term studies monitoring its ecosystem and wildlife to aid conservation efforts. As we celebrate the International Day of Forests, let's remember that protecting our trees is essential for preserving our planet's health. Take a moment to appreciate nature's beauty and support efforts to safeguard our forests for generations to come.

> With the sun rising higher, the days grow longer, marking the arrival of spring. The spring equinox occurs when the sun crosses the celestial equator, moving from the Southern Hemisphere to the Northern Hemisphere. Traditionally, spring is considered to begin on March 21. However, astronomers and calendar makers now agree that spring officially commences on March 20 across all time zones in North America. This event signals the true start of the season, bringing with it the beauty and symbolism of spring blooms.
> 
> Among these blooms, narcissus, commonly known as daffodil or jonquil—featured here—stands out as a quintessential symbol of the season. Celebrated for centuries in art and literature, the daffodil carries cultural significance worldwide, symbolizing death, renewal, and good fortune. As one of England's most cherished plants, the daffodil has been celebrated by many English writers for its cultural and symbolic significance, making it one of the most poetically revered flowers. From John Gower and Shakespeare to William Wordsworth and John Milton, daffodils have inspired countless verses in literary history.

> In the world of clever hunting, the black heron rules the roost. This bird thrives in shallow, open waters and at the edges of freshwater lakes and ponds. It's also commonly spotted in marshes, rice fields, seasonally flooded grasslands, and along riverbanks. At first glance, this feathered genius seems like any other wading bird, with its long legs, slender neck, and pointed beak that aid in hunting. But when it hunts, this jet-black African species showcases an extraordinary skill—it takes the shape of an umbrella, as seen in today's image.
> 
> While fishing, the black heron dips its head, extends its wings around its body, and forms a shaded canopy. This clever technique is known as canopy feeding. One common theory is that small fish, seeking cover, are attracted to the shade of the heron's wings and swim right into its trap. The shade acts like polarized sunglasses, reducing glare and improving the heron's vision under the water. Additionally, the heron might also be camouflaging itself, which further intensifies the trap for the fish.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
