> When it comes to honoring family members, parents and siblings get most of the attention—but today, let us sing the praises of our cousins on Cousins Day! These extended family members hold a special place in our hearts. They're not quite siblings, but more than mere friends. When we're young, they're the buddies we go adventuring with, while the adults stay behind to make small talk. Maybe you've fallen out of touch with your cousins, or maybe you're still close—either way, today's a great day to reach out, say hello, and reminisce. That's what it looks like these zebras are doing; there's likely a set of cousins or two in this group that's horsing around on the savannah in Tanzania.

> Legend has it that tea was first brewed accidentally around 2737 BC in China thanks to a strong wind and some loose leaves. If you find that hard to swallow, there are other origin stories to choose from. However, one thing is certain—the feeling it stirs in tea drinkers worldwide. From gongfu tea practice in China to darye in Korea, there are plenty of fascinating tea cultures to savor. Tea tourism has gained popularity, with visitors to tea plantations and estates learning all about their history. Our homepage image shows one such place, Nuwara Eliya's Edinburgh Estate in the central highlands of Sri Lanka. Nuwara Eliya's colonial-era buildings and mist-shrouded tea gardens have earned it the name 'Little England.' The area is known for producing some of the world's finest orange pekoe tea. So, for your next trip, are you willing to 'chai' something new?

<summary>Description</summary>

> Norway's picturesque Atlantic Ocean Road crosses eight bridges as it makes its way across islands, islets, and reefs to link the island of Averøya with the mainland Romsdal Peninsula. The longest of them, pictured here, is the Storseisundet Bridge. This bridge, surrounded by ample natural beauty, was tough to build. It took six years, and during construction workers were pelted by the region's unpredictable weather, including 12 hurricanes. It opened in 1989 and remains a popular visitor attraction. With its dramatic curve and sudden incline, Storseisundet Bridge creates the illusion of suddenly disappearing into the ocean, making drivers skip a heartbeat. Its construction showcases the brilliance of Norwegian engineering, blending seamlessly with the landscape.

> International Moon Day is celebrated on July 20, the day humans first set foot on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission in 1969. It recognizes our lunar achievements and highlights scientific and technological advancements, like NASA's Orion spacecraft, seen here. Designed for deep space exploration, Orion completed a test flight to the moon without astronauts in 2022 and will carry out a crewed orbit in 2024. The plan is to return astronauts to the moon's surface in 2025. NASA hopes that these flights, along with events like International Moon Day, will encourage public engagement and education about the moon and its influence on Earth, as well as the potential for future space exploration and colonization.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Crescent Lake is a captivating natural wonder hidden in the vast Gobi Desert near the Chinese city of Dunhuang in Gansu province. This oasis, named for its unusual shape, has been a vital water source here for centuries. The lake is thought to have formed in a valley carved by wind and been fed by an underground spring. It sits amid Dunhuang's 'singing' sand dunes, which make a noise when the wind blows. The sand dunes also help stop the lake from being swallowed by sand and conservation efforts have ensured that it doesn't dry out. Visitors enjoy boating on the lake, camel rides through the surrounding dunes, and seeing ancient Buddhist art and murals in the nearby Mogao Caves.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> The great hornbill is a remarkable bird found in the tropical forests of Southeast Asia. Despite weighing as much as 9 pounds and growing up to 4 feet long, it is an agile flyer capable of maneuvering through dense forests. Alongside its striking black and yellow plumage, the great hornbill has a unique helmet-like casque on its bill, which amplifies its calls. The bird primarily feeds on fruit but also eats small mammals, reptiles, and insects. While incubating her eggs, the female great hornbill seals herself inside a tree cavity, leaving a small opening through which the male inserts food. This magnificent bird holds cultural and spiritual significance in many Southeast Asian cultures as a sacred animal and the subject of festivals.
