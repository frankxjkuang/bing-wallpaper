<summary>Description</summary>

> Happy World Environment Day! First celebrated back in 1973, this UN event is now celebrated in more than 143 countries. This year's theme focuses on land restoration, desertification, and drought resilience.
> 
> Pictured here is Madagascar's Masoala National Park, part of the Rainforests of the Atsinanana UNESCO World Heritage Site. This park, which covers nearly 930 square miles, is a wildlife haven harboring hundreds of species including mammals like red ruffed lemurs and aye-ayes, birds like red owls and helmet vanga, reptiles like Madagascar day geckos and tomato frogs, and butterflies, coral species, fish, and sea turtles. The park has been at the forefront of conservation efforts to combat illegal logging, particularly of its rare rosewood trees. So, let's take inspiration from Masoala and champion the planet that cradles us all. After all, there is no planet B.

<summary>Description</summary>

> It's not just a name. Chestnut-headed bee-eaters spend their days swooping after stinging insects. As well as bees, they also feast on wasps, hornets, and other bugs. The birds in today's image are in Bardia National Park in Nepal, but they're found across many other South Asian countries, from India and Bangladesh to Sri Lanka and Thailand. They catch their prey in mid-flight, returning to a perch where they beat insects to stun them and remove the stinger, which makes them safe to eat. These birds are designed to hunt: Their dazzling green plumage helps camouflage them in dappled jungle light, their curved beak is perfect for picking off insects with precision, and their eyes can move individually, which makes them all the better for spotting bees.

> Bicycles are the best! An environmentally friendly form of transportation that is affordable and good for your health. Once you learn to ride, you'll never forget how to wheel around. Thanks to Polish American scientist Leszek Sibiliski's initiative, the United Nations declared June 3 World Bicycle Day in 2018.
> 
> Karl von Drais, a German inventor, is credited with developing the first two-wheeler, known variously as the laufmaschine, draisine, and vélocipède, in 1817. It certainly needed some further thinking, since the wooden frame and wheels didn't have pedals. The modern versions of bikes were developed in the late 1800s, but the materials used for them are constantly evolving to make the ride easier and more secure. So, hop on a bike to find your crew on World Bicycle Day!

> It's time to grab a trowel, roll up your sleeves, and get planting: National Gardening Week is starting today! First celebrated in 1987, the week is all about getting more people involved in gardening. Being home to a wide range of trees, flowers, shrubs, and grasses, gardens can help the environment by absorbing carbon dioxide, filtering water, and encouraging insect life. Gardening clubs across the country celebrate this week by organizing workshops, visiting public gardens, or placing plants at public facilities. Tending to a garden is also good exercise and being outside in the sunshine is a great way to get more vitamin D. Gardening can even boost your mood, helping you to feel more relaxed and peaceful. As the actress and keen gardener Audrey Hepburn put it: 'To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow.'

> June is Pride Month, commemorating the Stonewall uprising, a series of protests by the LGBTQIA+ community that began on June 28, 1969, in response to a police raid at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village in New York City. Various events around the world are held in June to honor and celebrate the LGBTQIA+ community, their history, achievements, and ongoing pursuit for equality. This month, vibrant parades hit the streets, and buildings light up in the colors of the rainbow—a symbol of the LGBTQIA+ social movements—in numerous cities to praise freedom for all. Today's homepage shows the skyline of San Francisco, home to one of the largest and oldest pride parades, with City Hall lit up in rainbow lights.

> In Yorkshire Dales National Park, the ancient village of Gunnerside is brimming with English charm and history. Picture yourself strolling through its narrow lanes, surrounded by rolling hills, lush pastures, and stone cottages, with the roar of the Swale River your only soundtrack. Designated in 1954, the national park is spread across 841 square miles, and there are over 1,000 farms in this area. One of the area's most distinctive features are its dry stone walls; built without any kind of mortar, they can last hundreds of years. There are thought to be over 5,000 miles of these walls in the Dales.
> 
> The village's name comes from 'Gunnar's saetr,' Old Norse for Gunnar's hill or pasture. The valley of Gunnerside Gill was a thriving center for the lead mining industry from the 17th to the 19th century. In the village, the Old Working Smithy & Museum, which is 229 years old, houses historic blacksmith tools and mining implements. Whether you're seeking a peaceful retreat or exploring England's storied past, Gunnerside beckons with a promise of unforgettable memories.

> On this day 90 years ago, Congress passed an act that would lead to the creation of one of America's natural gems: Everglades National Park in Florida. It would be another 13 years before enough land was acquired to make the park a reality, but today it encapsulates the largest subtropical wilderness in the US. Spanning more than 1.5 million acres, the park is a lifeline to 36 federally protected and endangered wildlife species, from the gentle manatee to the stealthy Florida panther. Here, the air thrums with the calls of over 350 bird species like limpkins and snail kites, while the waters teem with life including hundreds of species of fish, sea turtles, and American crocodiles. Beyond its biodiversity, the park is celebrated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, an International Biosphere Reserve, and a Wetland of International Importance. Here's to Everglades National Park—may it continue to inspire wonder, curiosity, and appreciation for the wild world around us.

Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
