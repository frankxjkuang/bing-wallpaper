<summary>Description</summary>

> Iceland's glacial rivers have shaped the landscape here in the land of fire and ice over thousands of years. The rivers seen in today's image are formed from the meltwater of vast glaciers like Vatnajökull, Langjökull, and Hofsjökull. Vatnajökull, the largest ice cap in Iceland, covers over 3,000 square miles—approximately 10% of the country's landmass. As the glaciers melt, the water carries fine sediments, creating a braided river system with a milky appearance that contrasts with the earthy tones of the volcanic terrain. Every spring and summer, the rivers swell with seasonal meltwater, continually shaping and reshaping the land. Aerial views reveal their intricate patterns, interwoven across the terrain toward the North Atlantic Ocean. The water also powers hydroelectric power stations, reinforcing Iceland's status as a leader in sustainable energy.

> Amidst the mist-covered cedars and Sitka spruces of Canada's Great Bear Rainforest, the Vancouver Coastal Sea wolf roams free. These canines thrive in this ecosystem in British Columbia, which stretches from the north of Vancouver Island to the Alaskan border. This unique subspecies of the gray wolf is specific to the region and leads a semi-aquatic lifestyle, swimming between islands in search of food. Unlike other wolf species, they have a marine-based diet, consisting of fish, clams, mussels, crabs, otters, and seals. These animals live in packs, communicating with each other through growls, barks, and whines, so they're often heard before they are seen.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Olympic National Park, established in 1938, offers an escape into unspoiled wilderness. It covers nearly 1,440 square miles on Washington's Olympic Peninsula. With a labyrinth of ecosystems that range from glacier-capped mountains to temperate rainforests, the park is a home for wildlife and an International Biosphere Reserve. Within it lies Shi Shi Beach, a serene stretch where the Pacific laps against sea stacks and sandy shores, as seen in today's image.
> 
> From here, you can follow one of the park's many trails and trek along the coast to see the beach's sea arch at Point of the Arches, an outcrop that has over 30 sea stacks, columns of rock rising from the beach. Within the park, visitors can get a closer look at Mount Olympus, spot over 300 bird species like red-breasted nuthatches, winter wrens, and spotted owls. They can also take a refreshing swim in Lake Crescent. The coastal wilderness area north of Cape Alava, including Shi Shi Beach, has been home to the Makah Tribe of the Pacific Northwest Coast for over 2,000 years. Visitors can gain an insight into their culture at the nearby Makah Reservation.

> It's time to get out and vote! In 1845, Congress designated the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November as the day Americans vote for most federal offices. Prior to this, states held elections on a date of their choosing within about a month of early December, which created issues with early and late elections. For convenience and to save money, many elections for state and local offices are also held on Election Day.
> 
> At the heart of this process is Washington DC, seat of the US federal government. Pictured here today is the National Mall, a landscaped park in the capital that is affectionately known as America's Front Yard. Within the National Mall lie some of the country's most famous museums and monuments, including the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, and the Smithsonian Institution. It also serves as a symbolic and physical link between two of the branches of government, connecting the Capitol building—home of the legislature—to the White House, headquarters of the executive branch. The US Supreme Court, representing the judiciary, sits at the eastern end of the National Mall.

<summary>Description</summary>

> A place where poetry, history, and nature blend—welcome to Grasmere in England's Lake District. The village was once the cherished residence of the celebrated poet William Wordsworth, who described Grasmere, with its valley and lake of the same name, as 'the loveliest spot that man hath found.' Here, visitors are greeted by old cottages and homes built from local bluish-green slate. Dove Cottage, Wordsworth's humble abode from 1799 to 1808, and the adjacent museum offer a dive into the poet's life. His later residence, Rydal Mount, continues the story just a short journey away. The heart of the village is St. Oswald's Church, which dates to the 13th century and is Wordsworth's final resting place. Not far from the church, the aroma of the renowned Grasmere Gingerbread, made from a secret recipe, will set visitors' mouths watering.

> Today is the International Day for Biosphere Reserves. Biosphere reserves may sound like a mouthful, but they're essentially nature's sweet spots— biodiverse places that are home to a huge variety of life. These reserves, recognized by UNESCO, keep ecosystems healthy, protect endangered species, and help regulate climate through forests, wetlands, and other crucial habitats. There are 759 biosphere reserves across 136 countries. From the lush greenery of the Sundarbans in India to the vast expanses of the Great Sandy Biosphere Reserve in Australia, each reserve is unique.
> 
> Let's visit another—the Ría Lagartos Biosphere Reserve in Yucatán, Mexico, a UNESCO-protected sanctuary since 2004. Its forests and savannas cradle over 550 vertebrate species, including 142 species found only here. There are over 400 bird species in this reserve, including a large population of flamingos whose nests are seen in today's image. Biosphere reserves are all about balance, and Ría Lagartos is a prime example. Fishing, ecotourism, and even salt production are done in ways that respect the environment.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Once upon a time, in the boundless grasslands of North America, there roamed creatures of great strength and majesty—the American bison. These animals were a key part of life for many Native American tribes, providing food, clothing, and tools. Their population dwindled perilously low in the late 1800s, falling from as many as 60 million to fewer than 1,000 due to excessive hunting and disease. Enter a group of conservationists, ranchers, and Native Americans who stepped in to save the species. Now, over 500,000 bison roam again, many in protected areas like Yellowstone National Park, featured in today's image. Today, on National Bison Day, observed every first Saturday in November, we honor these noble creatures—a testament to the American spirit and the monumental conservation efforts to save them.
> 
> It's no wonder the bison was officially named the national mammal in 2016. From the buffalo nickel to state flags, they are a deeply embedded symbol in American culture. Bison are North America's largest mammals, and they have been introduced as far away as Russia. While the bison has made a heroic recovery, the story isn't over. These animals still face challenges, including habitat loss and hunting.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
