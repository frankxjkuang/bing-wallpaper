<summary>Description</summary>

> If you're lucky enough to see this view through the lens of your diving mask, you must be snorkeling in Jellyfish Lake on the island of Eil Malk in the Pacific island nation of Palau. Golden jellyfish are a subspecies unique to this small lake, on this small island—they're found nowhere else on the planet. Millions of teacup-sized golden jellies inhabit the lake, following the sunlight that nourishes them. Symbiotic algae live inside the jellyfish and provide their hosts with energy as a byproduct of photosynthesis. The more sun the jellies get, the more energy they derive from their hitchhikers. The jellies start the day at the east end of the lake and drift westward until dusk, following the arc of the sun.
> 
> The saltwater marine lake they live in is one of dozens in the Rock Islands, which Eil Malk is part of. The Rock Islands, declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2012, is a scattering of hundreds of very small, mostly unpopulated limestone islands and islets characterized by their mushroom-like shapes. On Eil Malk, Jellyfish Lake appears to be landlocked, but it's connected to the ocean by three shallow tunnels that bring water into and out of the lake with the tides. Nevertheless, the lake is so isolated from the nearby lagoon that the golden jellies evolved in this micro universe mostly cut off from other food sources and predators. As a result, they've lost their ability to sting. So, if you take a dip—snorkeling is allowed, but not scuba diving—there's no need to keep a polite distance.

> There's a chance this dazzling, ground-up view of fall foliage is not where you think it is. While New England garners most of the leaf-peeping attention in the US this time of year, the high country of Colorado puts on a spectacular show out West. The aspens of the Centennial State turn shades of gold and orange in autumn, which officially starts today. Fall typically marks the end of vacations, the beginning of school, the arrival of chilly nights, and, if you're lucky, a display of leaves turned brilliant shades of gold and red.
> 
> This thicket of aspen trees is on the Last Dollar Road, an 18-mile scenic drive in southwest Colorado that is as dramatic as its name suggests, with switchbacks and stunning views of peaks and meadows and of course the aspen trees that paint the land come September. Aspens thrive in the cold winters and cool summers of western North America, where they grow at altitudes between 5,000 to 11,000 feet. Their distinct, round leaves quake in the wind, making it appear as if the trees are glittering in the sunlight. Aspens generally grow on west-facing slopes, gorging on the afternoon sun. They're among the world's largest living organisms because aspen groves share a single root system. They're also the state's only native deciduous tree and cover about a fifth of its forested land.
> 
> There are many places to see them, but none better than the Last Dollar Road. It's unique among scenic byways in the US. For one, it's not a highway at all, but a road, and a dirt road at that. It joins the towns of Ridgway in the north and Telluride in the south, but this bumpy path twists and turns in every direction as well as up and down. The road is never plowed, so when the first snow falls, the road closes and stays closed until spring arrives. That makes this the last time of year you can take this drive, and it happens to be the most beautiful. Just make sure your tires have plenty of tread and your shock absorbers are ready for a workout.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we're marking the International Day of Peace, first commemorated in 1981, when the United Nations dedicated the day to 'strengthening the ideals of peace, through observing 24 hours of nonviolence and ceasefire.' This year's theme is 'End racism, build peace.' As the UN says, 'Achieving true peace entails much more than laying down arms. It requires the building of societies where all members feel that they can flourish. It involves creating a world in which people are treated equally, regardless of their race.'
> 
> Our photo today shows a striking symbolic artwork that seems as if it were commissioned to commemorate the International Day of Peace. Thousands of hands helped create 'Peace Doves,' an artwork installation from 2021 by sculptor Peter Walker that pulled together children and community groups in Liverpool, England. People wrote personal messages of peace on 18,000 paper doves, then those birds joined a dramatic heavenward flight of doves suspended on 15.5 miles of ribbon from the ceiling of Liverpool Cathedral. The lighting drew the focus to the powerful art installation, and if you stood inside the canopy of doves, you could look up and see where the strings of birds converged into starry points of light. Composer David Harper's musical soundscape added yet another layer to the artwork, which people flocked to—60,000 visitors marveled at the 'Peace Doves' in the first month. The main impressions noted? 'Beautiful' and 'moving.'

<summary>Description</summary>

> Officially called Enhydra lutris, and unofficially known as the cutest creatures that float, these sea otters in Sitka Sound, Alaska, are doing what otters do, showing us that it truly does take a village, in this case a flotilla. Groups of either males or females (sometimes with pups), are appropriately named rafts. Male rafts tend to be larger and can number more than 1,000 individuals. Sea otters' buoyant bodies indeed work like literal rafts, standing in as cradles, dinner tables, or any kind of solid surface. That's handy because otters spend the vast majority of their lives in the water, even giving birth in the sea. Although they seem to live carefree lives, frolicking and grooming and diving, they also serve an important role in keeping their aquatic ecosystems healthy, something to remember this week as we mark Sea Otter Awareness Week, observed every year during the last week of September.
> 
> Otters keep the giant kelp forests of the Pacific Ocean healthy by eating sea urchins, which would otherwise decimate kelp, an important habitat for many fish and other sea creatures. Otters also eat crabs, shellfish, squid, and other invertebrates. They've learned to crack the shells of some of their shellfish prey by smashing the crustaceans and mollusks against a rock (fetched from the sea floor of course) lodged on their bellies. An otter's caloric needs are huge. It must eat a quarter of its body weight each day to keep up with its cold-water metabolism.
> 
> The key to an otter's aquatic lifestyle is its fur, the thickest of any mammal, with about 1 million hairs per square inch, so dense its skin never actually gets wet. Otters need all those gazillion hairs to stay warm as they don't have a layer of blubber like other marine mammals. Their luxuriant coats made them favorite targets for 18th- and 19th-century trappers who hunted otters to near extinction before they were protected by law. Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.

> Britain bids farewell to Queen Elizabeth II today, as her state funeral takes place in London's historic Westminster Abbey. Crowds are lining the streets to pay their final respects to the queen, who died peacefully at her Scottish residence, Balmoral, at age 96 on September 8, after more than 70 years on the throne. The royal family, world leaders, and senior UK politicians are attending the funeral, which is being broadcast across the world. After the service, the queen will be laid to rest in St. George's Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle, alongside Prince Philip, her beloved husband of 73 years, whom she described as her "strength and stay."
> 
> Queen Elizabeth II is Britain's longest-reigning monarch, and she dedicated her life to public service through turbulent times in the nation and beyond. From jubilees and celebrations to tragedy and political upheaval, she remained a constant, steady force, balancing duty and family responsibilities in her role as the country's head of state.
> 
> While Britons are sharing their loss and memories of the queen, some see it as a time to question the very existence of the monarchy, wishing to break with their colonial past by removing the British monarch as head of state and becoming a republic. All eyes are on her son King Charles III as he begins his reign, wondering whether he will follow closely in his mother's footsteps or forge a royal path of his own.

<summary>Description</summary>

> One of the most photographed places in Japan is this otherworldly grove of towering bamboo. The Arashiyama Bamboo Grove on the outskirts of Kyoto is surrounded by temples and shrines along the Katsura River. Rising as a manicured oasis of stories-high bamboo, the grove seems to turn the world green. The former villas and temples of the old noble class are located near the Arashiyama Grove, and its single 500-yard path is usually filled with visitors wielding cameras and selfie sticks, making this serene view a rare one.
> 
> World Bamboo Day, celebrated September 18, was created in 2009 to bring attention to this useful and versatile plant that flourishes in East Asia. Though the tallest bamboo can grow up to 100 feet, bamboo is not a tree but a grass. Known for its light weight, strength, and rapid growth, bamboo can be used to make almost anything, from clothing to building materials—and its shoots can even be consumed as food. Because it grows as much as 3 feet in a day, it's a highly renewable resource. For the same reason, it's also an invasive species in some places, as a small stand of bamboo can quickly become a large one. While bamboo grows best in tropical and warm climates, it adapts well to cool temperatures and high altitudes. And though it might have the most cultural value in Asia, it grows wild in Africa, the Americas, and Australia, too. Could there be bamboo growing near you?

> Oom-pah, oom-pah… That sound can mean only one thing (at least that isn't chocolate factory-related). It's Oktoberfest season! Don't start the party too fast, though: You might want to ride the Wellenflug swing carousel seen in today's photo before you get too much of that distinctly German beer in your belly. And it is distinct: Due to strict Reinheitsgebot ('purity orders') regulations in place since 1516, real German beer can only be made with certain ingredients—originally just barley, hops, and water, though other additions have trickled in over time.
> 
> From today until October 3, brass bands will play traditional German folk music as festive crowds eat, drink, and generally be merry in Munich, Germany—and most everywhere, thanks to the many copycat fests now held around the world. But let's face it, the Germans have most of us beat for beer consumption, as each Munich Oktoberfest sees nearly 2 million gallons of the stuff quaffed by visitors.
