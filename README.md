> Picture this: it's 1955, a winter evening in Montgomery, Alabama. A seamstress heads home after work. The bus fills with other passengers. The driver demands she give up her seat. Rosa Parks wasn't trying to make waves, but her refusal set off a chain reaction that would propel the civil rights movement into a new phase. Raised in rural Alabama, she grew up under segregation and later worked with the NAACP as a secretary and investigator, gathering testimony of racial violence and discrimination. By the time she declined to move, she was already a committed activist.
> 
> Her arrest sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott, a coordinated 381-day protest that helped end bus segregation. Rosa Parks Day emerged decades later to honor her work. First celebrated in 1998 in Michigan, it is observed on different dates across states, tied either to her birthday or to the day of her arrest. As Parks' national impact grew, she earned various medals, awards, and the distinction of being the first woman to lie in honor at the US Capitol rotunda. The stained-glass painting of Parks at Shorter Community African Methodist Episcopal Church in Denver, pictured here today, serves as a glowing reminder of a legacy that still reaches far beyond Montgomery.

<summary>Description</summary>

> You know a place holds stories when geologists, filmmakers, and local folklore all claim it for different reasons. Lake Tahoe, straddling the border between California and Nevada, fits that bill perfectly. Formed during the Ice Age, the lake was shaped by faulting and glacial carving that created its deep basin. It is now one of the deepest freshwater lakes in the United States. For generations, the Washoe people lived around these clear waters, fishing and gathering seasonally. Centuries later, miners arrived, steamboats crossed the water, and Tahoe shifted from a resource hub to a year-round retreat.
> 
> Emerald Bay, seen in today's image, became one of its most photographed corners. Because the bay is shallower than the main lake, its water takes on a lighter hue. Beneath the surface rest old launches and barges, now preserved within Emerald Bay State Park. In the middle, Fannette Island rises with a small stone 'Tea House,’ a 1920s structure built by philanthropist Lora Knight, who also commissioned Vikingsholm nearby. And the story doesn't end here. Local stories mention 'Tahoe Tessie,' the lake's mythical creature. You never know—maybe you'll catch a ripple that makes you look twice.

> Every February 2, the world turns its eyes to a furry little forecaster with a penchant for popping out of holes: the groundhog. Legend has it that if this pint-sized predictor sees its shadow, winter drags on for six more weeks. No shadow? Spring is just around the corner. It's a quirky tradition that turns a small rodent into a celebrity meteorologist.
> 
> Groundhog Day has its roots in an old European custom in which a hedgehog or badger would predict the weather. When German immigrants came to Pennsylvania, they passed the forecasting torch to the local rodents, giving rise to Punxsutawney Phil—the most famous groundhog of them all. Each year, thousands gather in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to witness Phil's prediction, while millions watch from home, hoping for an early spring.
> 
> Across the Atlantic, the idea of reading the seasons through wildlife has its own twist. In the Alps, people watch for Alpine marmots, seen in today's image. After a long winter nap, these mountain dwellers emerge from their burrows into the light, often signaling warmer days ahead. They never get an official 'shadow ceremony,' but their timing acts as nature's quiet calendar in high-altitude communities.

> Some months arrive quietly, but February knocks on the door, flips on the spotlight, and says, 'Let's give credit where it's long overdue.' That's the spirit of Black History Month—a time to celebrate African American achievements, confront hard truths, and honor those who shaped the country. It began in 1926 when historian Carter G. Woodson launched Negro History Week. The week grew, spread through schools and communities, and by 1976 it officially expanded into a month.
> 
> February isn't only about icons like Martin Luther King Jr. or Rosa Parks—it also highlights stories that rarely made headlines. One example comes from World War II: in 1944, a US Army Signal Corps photograph captured Black military nurses arriving at the port of Greenock, Scotland. Their overseas service was historic, especially for nurses who had fought to serve beyond segregated bases at home.
> 
> Today, this month feels like a mix of classrooms, concerts, and community meetups. Museums curate exhibits, and schools highlight inventors, thinkers, and trailblazers who never made it into older textbooks. Modern voices also take center stage—scientists pushing boundaries, athletes rewriting records, artists reshaping culture, and entrepreneurs building what comes next.

> Some animals whisper their way through the wild. Zebras don't. They show up in high-contrast stripes, act like it's the most practical outfit ever invented—and somehow, it is. International Zebra Day, celebrated on January 31, gives these black-and-white originals their moment to step out of the herd and into the spotlight.
> 
> These African equines come in three species. Plains zebras—featured in today's image from Namibia's Etosha National Park—wear bold stripes, mountain ones sport pinstripes, and Grévy's go for the ultra-fine, designer look. No two patterns match, turning every individual into a walking fingerprint. Scientists believe those stripes help confuse predators, deter biting flies, and even cool the body by creating tiny air currents.
> 
> Watch a herd—technically called a dazzle—and you'll see how social they are. They groom one another, babysit foals, and communicate through brays and barks. Foals recognize their mothers by memorizing patterns within hours of birth. These mammals are built for speed—up to 40 mph—and teamwork, forming tight circles when threatened. However, shrinking habitats, poaching, and competition with livestock continue to threaten them, making this day essential for raising awareness.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Picture a small island rising from the Cornish sea, connected to the mainland only when the tide retreats. For a few hours a day, you can wander across a centuries-old granite causeway made smooth by pilgrims and fishermen. This is St. Michael's Mount, just off the coast of Marazion, in Cornwall, England. Managed by the National Trust and home to the St. Aubyn family since the 1600s, the mount blends myth, medieval history, and sweeping coastal views.
> 
> The island is filled with stories: from the Archangel Michael guiding sailors to safety in 495 CE to tales of Jack the Giant Killer defeating the fearsome Cormoran. At the summit stands a castle that began as a 12th-century priory, later transformed into a Gothic-inspired fortress with regal drawing rooms, hidden staircases, and panoramic terraces.
> 
> Below, the harbor's cobbled lanes wind through a historic fishing village once busy with boats and trade. Whether you are exploring the gardens clinging to the granite cliffs or wandering the battlements imagining battles of the Civil War and the Spanish Armada, St. Michael's Mount is a rare place where past and legend feel equally alive.

<summary>Description</summary>

> If you've ever wandered through downtown Milwaukee and looked up in awe, chances are you were staring at the iconic Milwaukee City Hall. Completed in 1895, this towering Flemish Renaissance Revival masterpiece doesn't just dominate the skyline; it defines it. For nearly eight decades, it stood as the city's tallest building, a title it proudly held until 1973. Designed by architect Henry C. Koch, this hall blends German-inspired architecture with Milwaukee's own historic influences. That connection isn't accidental—its design pays tribute to the city's strong German heritage, which shaped much of the surrounding neighborhood as well.
> 
> One of the building's most fascinating features lies beneath your feet: its foundation rests on more than 2,500 white pine piles driven deep into the marshy banks of the Milwaukee River. Inside, visitors are greeted by a soaring eight-story atrium crowned with a glass skylight, seen in today's image.
> 
> Recognized for its significance, Milwaukee City Hall earned a spot on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and was named a National Historic Landmark in 2005. Today, it's still the beating heart of Milwaukee's civic life and a must-see for anyone curious about the city's story.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
