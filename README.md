> Today we're following our nose to the Pantanal in Brazil to visit this member of the toucan family named for the brownish plumage around its ears. What, you've never heard of a chestnut-eared aracari? That could be because aracaris don't really stand out among toucans at a glance: They have long, colorful bills, and they mate for life, always laying eggs in the same nest year after year. But aracaris are much more social nesters: Up to six aracari adults and all their babies might live in one nest.
> 
> Toucans are found in tropical climates in Central and South America, mainly in rainforests—our chestnut-eared friend tends to live in the southern Amazon Basin. Known frugivores, or fruit eaters, toucans have also been spotted eating the occasional lizard or even rival bird. They tend to be friendly with humans and have been successfully kept as pets—but probably prefer the wild life.

> Patriot Day is held each September 11 to honor the people who were killed in the terrorist attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001. US government buildings throughout the world fly the American flag at half-staff on this day, as do many private homes and establishments. Although schools, government offices, and businesses typically remain open on Patriot Day, communities throughout the country hold remembrances and events to honor the 2,977 people who died.
> 
> Patriot Day is also a time to honor thousands of first responders who worked tirelessly and put themselves in harm's way in the horrific aftermath of the attacks. Tribute is also paid to the many men and women who fought in Afghanistan in the months following the attacks.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Many people in Asia celebrate the fall harvest season with the Mid-Autumn Festival—and since the moon is the, um, star of the show, it's also known as the Moon Festival. The holiday falls on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month each year and coincides with the full moon. Our photo features a moon installation from the festivities in Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia. The city is known for its colorful decorations and lively activities during the festival: Crowds flood the city to watch puppet shows, dragon dances, and parades lit by lanterns.
> 
> Of course, no festival is complete without food. Mooncakes are the most abundant treat at the Mid-Autumn Festival. These small, tasty pastries vary in style and flavor depending on the country where you're celebrating. Here in Kuala Lumpur, you can find traditional Chinese mooncakes but also unique local varieties, like some made with durian (a prickly tropical fruit known for both great flavor and ghastly smell) and cubilose (said to be delicious despite being made from dried bird spit).
> 
> But even if you're not keen to sample every kind of mooncake, you can come together with people of all races and creeds to celebrate Mid-Autumn. After all, the moon lights the way for us all.

<summary>Description</summary>

> One of the greatest marvels of the marine world, the Belize Barrier Reef runs 190 miles along the Central American country's Caribbean coast. It's part of the larger Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System that stretches from Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula to Honduras and is the second-largest reef in the world behind the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996, the Belize Barrier Reef has remained relatively healthy even as many of the planet's reefs are threatened by climate change.
> 
> Featured here is a mangrove forest on Lighthouse Reef, one of three major atolls (above-water sections of reef that form ringlike, often lush island chains) in the reef system. It's the most visited of the atolls for one reason: Near its center is the Great Blue Hole, a marine sinkhole that's 1,043 feet across, 407 feet deep, and a bucket-list destination for serious scuba divers. Now protected within the Blue Hole Natural Monument, the hole was made famous when oceanographer Jacques Cousteau charted its depths in 1971.
> 
> The barrier reef is by far Belize's most popular tourist attraction, a destination for diving and fishing as well as sightseeing. An exceptionally diverse ecosystem, it includes more than 400 cays or islands, mangrove forests, coastal lagoons, estuaries, and coral atolls. Think of it as a taste of the South Pacific, but a lot closer to home.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The first recorded expedition to successfully circumnavigate the Earth returned here to Seville, Spain, 500 years ago today. This was the remnants of the Spanish fleet that had set sail under the command of Ferdinand Magellan almost exactly three years previously with the goal of finding a western sea route to the rich Spice Islands of Indonesia. While Magellan gets the glory as leader of the expedition, he didn't actually complete the marathon voyage—he had been killed in a skirmish in the Philippines in April 1521. In the end, his place as leader of the five-ship voyage was filled by Juan Sebastián Elcano, whose command ship, the 'Vittoria,' was the only one in the convoy that survived the trip. Harsh conditions, starvation, scurvy, hostile encounters, and other struggles had taken their toll: Of the roughly 270 crew members who set out, only 18 returned with the expedition.
> 
> Although he made only half of this globe-circling journey, Magellan is rightly honored as an outstanding navigator, especially given the rudimentary knowledge of world geography and relatively primitive navigational tools of the time. He was the first European to traverse the strait that now bears his name near the tip of South America, trailblazing the first known passage between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The eventual success of Magellan's expedition, however bedraggled its remaining crew, also offered the first practical proof of a notion many 16th-century people were still skeptical about: The Earth is round.

> Today we visit the Museu do Amanhã (Museum of Tomorrow) in Rio de Janeiro to celebrate 200 years of Brazilian independence. Designed by Spanish neofuturist architect Santiago Calatrava, the unique structure was commissioned to showcase Rio's revitalized waterfront ahead of the 2016 Olympics. The museum comprises five main areas: Cosmos, Earth, Anthropocene, Tomorrow, and Us, each inviting visitors to interact in different ways and learn about living in a sustainable world.
> 
> Brazil gained independence from Portugal just a few decades after the United States broke off from Great Britain, though it happened in a decidedly different way. Don Pedro I, first emperor of Brazil, was a member of the Portuguese ruling family (he would eventually briefly rule Portugal too). When Portugal threatened to take back the political autonomy Brazil had enjoyed since 1808, Pedro sided with his adopted homeland against the Portuguese. After a three-year war that was largely bloodless, the Empire of Brazil, which preceded the vibrantly diverse democracy we know today, was born on September 7, 1822.

> Oh, to be a squirrel with a feast such as this! It's National Mushroom Month, and it seems our red squirrel friend here in Alaska got a literal jump on celebrating. It might surprise you, but squirrels don't only eat nuts. They'll eat just about whatever's around and that includes big mushrooms. Though a small percentage of wild mushrooms can be poisonous to humans, squirrels can eat many of these frightening fungi without worry, thanks to special proteins in their guts. Nice to know someone's enjoying them.
> 
> Did you know the United States has a Mushroom Council? Since the early 1990s, the US Mushroom Council has worked as a Research and Promotion program of the Department of Agriculture. After an informal declaration during a Pennsylvania mushroom festival, the council proposed National Mushroom Month not just to highlight mushrooms as a culinary delicacy, but also showcase many other uses for the more than 900 million pounds of mushrooms the US produces each year. Believe it or not, we use mushrooms to build, clean, medicate, and even make leather—and so much more.

> 
> Solar Impulse 2 was the second aircraft built by Swiss aviators André Borschberg and Bertrand Piccard. Borschberg is an engineer by training, Piccard a psychiatrist and balloonist who copiloted the first balloon to fly around the world nonstop. The pair took turns piloting the aircraft, which can carry only one person, on a multi-leg, 16-month flight around the world that started and ended in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.
> 
> This image was taken during the final leg from Egypt to Abu Dhabi as Solar Impulse 2 flew over the Great Pyramids of Giza. The superlight plane was powered by thousands of solar cells mounted atop its fuselage and jumbo-jet sized wings. Batteries stored energy so it could fly at night. The going was slow by the standards of modern jet travel—Solar Impulse 2 flew at an average speed of 50 mph. Clearly, solar-powered flight on a commercial scale is still many years away, but as this photo shows, its Kitty Hawk moment is in the books.
