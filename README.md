> May the Force be with you on May 4, adopted by 'Star Wars' fans as the day to celebrate their favorite franchise. Many will recognize Skellig Michael, the island on our homepage, as the location of scenes from the 'Star Wars' sequels, 'The Force Awakens' and 'The Last Jedi.' This UNESCO World Heritage Site appears in the movies as the planet Ahch-To, where Jedi master Luke Skywalker seeks refuge. Home to a 6th-century monastery with beehive huts and stone staircases, it also hosts a large seabird population that inspired the penguin-like porgs that roost on Ahch-To. Skellig Michael is about 7 miles off Ireland's southwestern coast, daily visitors are limited, and boat trips are canceled if it is too stormy. Still, the island attracts 'Star Wars' fans and others keen to see this ancient site, not so very far, far away.

> Welcome to the Sonoran Desert, where life thrives despite the heat thanks to two seasons of rainfall. This subtropical desert spreads across parts of Mexico, California, and Arizona and is home to animals such as roadrunners, Gila monsters, and the Morafka's desert tortoise. Its rainy seasons are followed by the blossoming of colorful wildflowers such as the brittlebush, seen in today's image. These hardy shrubs are adapted to the dry seasons, with their silvery-gray leaves covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Brittlebushes produce bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding splashes of color to the desert landscape. Another drought-loving desert flora is the saguaro cactus, which can live for over 150 years and grow up to 40 feet tall. The saguaro also provides food and shelter for desert species and is a sacred plant in the culture of the Tohono O'odham people.

> As the first day of May dawns in Hawaii, Lei Day bursts forth in a riot of color, fragrance, and festivity. Leis are garlands crafted from flowers, leaves, and even shells, carrying significant cultural importance in Hawaiian culture. Leis were brought by the Polynesians as they migrated eastward through the Pacific Islands before reaching Hawaii between 1000 and 1200 CE. They represent love, respect, and the ever-present aloha spirit, described as 'the coordination of mind and heart within each person.' Lei Day is an all-day fiesta that includes parades, pageants, lei-making contests, hula dances, and feasts. It also marks the beginning of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.

> Blink and you'll miss it! The fastest mammal in the world, the cheetah, is one of Tanzania's iconic big cats. Pictured here in Ngorongoro Conservation Area, cheetahs inhabit diverse landscapes from the Serengeti grasslands to the arid expanses of the Sahara. They have long tails, elongated legs, and a slender build that helps them move quickly.
> 
> In early Egyptian mythology, Mafdet, goddess of justice, would often be depicted as a woman wearing the head of a cheetah. Ancient Egyptians also believed that cheetahs carried away the spirits of departed pharaohs. These days, cheetahs face threats from habitat loss, human conflict, poaching, and diseases, leaving their global population vulnerable. Let's commit to protecting their habitat and preserving their legacy for generations to come.

> Let's step into a world of giant earthen homes designed to house a village. These 'tulou' structures, built between the 12th and 20th centuries, are the dwellings of the Hakka community in China's mountainous southeastern Fujian region. The homes are constructed from clay, sandy soil, and gray tiles, with bamboo strips serving as the support. They were built to house a whole clan, up to 800 people each. From above, these round dwellings look like giant tires or reels lying on their sides, with light walls, dark roofs, and spacious interiors.
> 
> Historically, these buildings were communal living spaces and defensive zones for Hakka clans. They were built with uniformly sized and shaped family areas, fostering a sense of equality and community. In 2008, UNESCO added Fujian Tulou, which includes 46 of the buildings, to its list of World Heritage Sites, recognizing their unique building tradition. So, if you are longing for a getaway that transcends the ordinary, come to Fujian Tulou!

> Take advantage of the last day of National Park Week! If you haven't had time to take part, we've got your back. Let us take you to Guadalupe Mountains National Park in West Texas. The park, officially established in 1972, covers 86,416 acres. Here, the Guadalupe Mountains rise over the salt dunes of the Chihuahuan Desert and include the highest point in Texas, the 8,751-foot Guadalupe Peak. Pictured on today's homepage is another iconic landmark, El Capitan. Not to be confused with its famous namesake in California, this limestone cliff towers 8,085 feet high and is often used as a waymark for travelers. Even if National Park Week is over, there are plenty of days in the year to visit the country's abundant natural splendor.
