<summary>Description</summary>

> Before GPS told ships where to go, lighthouses lit the way—each with its own flash pattern so sailors could figure out where they were, even in total darkness. It's National Lighthouse Day, a perfect excuse to give these coastal workhorses some credit. In 1789, Congress passed a law to make sure all lighthouses were taken care of by the federal government. Whether you're a history buff, coastal explorer, or just into old engineering, today is a great day to learn more about lighthouses or visit one with your friends and family.
> 
> Like many lighthouses around the world, Florida's Gasparilla Island Lights still hold their ground. The Gasparilla Island Rear Range Light, seen in today's image, has had quite a journey. Originally assembled in Delaware, it found its forever home here in 1927 but was decommissioned by the Coast Guard in 2014. The lighthouse was restored to its former glory in 2017 and was switched on again in 2018. Today, it blinks white every six seconds. Both lights are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The lighthouse grounds and museum are open to visitors seasonally, offering insights into the area's shipping past.

<summary>Description</summary>

> No road signs, no souvenir stands—just 11 miles of mud, cliffs, and sweeping views leading to one of Hawaii's most remote beaches. Kalalau Beach, at the end of Kauai's Kalalau Trail, is where tired feet meet a sandy reward. The only land access is the trail itself, a rugged trek through valleys and along coastal cliffs. During summer, some arrive by kayak, but all visitors need permits to stay.
> 
> Long before camping permits and composting toilets, this remote stretch supported generations of Native Hawaiians. Thanks to freshwater streams and fertile soil, early Hawaiians farmed taro (a root vegetable widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions) in stone terraces. Fishing, farming, and a deep spiritual connection to the land (āina) shaped daily life. Remnants of temples and house sites still lie hidden in the valley's folds. By the 1920s, most residents had left due to disease, Western contact, and shifting land use. In recent decades, off-the-grid seekers sought refuge here until state protections were implemented. Today, Kalalau is both sacred and scenic—a place where history lingers with every crashing wave.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Not every science lesson requires a classroom. In La Jolla, California, tide pools teach you about ocean life—right at your feet. Along the rocky shoreline of this San Diego coastal neighborhood, tide pools form during low tide as seawater gets trapped in natural depressions. These shallow pools form naturally along La Jolla's rocky shorelines, especially near Windansea Beach, Shell Beach, South Casa Beach, and Hospital Point. The water that remains trapped in sandstone and reef depressions creates habitats for everything from sea hares to brittle stars. Over time, the tide pools are created through the process of erosion—waves hit the sandstone and limestone coastlines until they carve out pockets that hold water. Twice a day, as the tide moves in and out, these spaces flood and drain, challenging the survival skills of everything inside. Winter months, when tides are lowest during daylight hours, are ideal for observing them.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Silent hunters of the night sky, owls are among the most intriguing creatures in the animal kingdom. Their ability to turn their heads up to 270 degrees—combined with silent flight and exceptional night vision—showcases their remarkable adaptations. With over 200 species found across the globe, these birds contribute to ecological balance and are deeply woven into cultural traditions. Celebrated annually on August 4, International Owl Awareness Day not only honors their presence in nature but also raises awareness about the threats they face.
> 
> Featured here is a nesting pair of great gray owls. Known as the world's largest owl species by length, which ranges from 24 to 33 inches, they span the Northern Hemisphere and are found in both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. Unlike many birds, they don't build their own nests—instead, they repurpose those left behind by large raptors or settle into broken treetops and hollow trunks. Despite their size and status as apex predators, they are non-aggressive, rarely clashing with rivals or intruders. However, during the fledgling stage, the female fiercely protects her vulnerable and flightless young.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Bright and bold, sunflowers are loved by bees, birds, and just about everyone. The name of their genus, helianthus, comes from the Greek words for sun (helios) and flower (anthos). These annual plants are known for their large, daisy-like flowers and radiant charm. While sunflowers come in shades of red, orange, and maroon, it's the classic yellow blooms with brown centers that are the most common.
> 
> Beyond their good looks, sunflowers are grown for their tasty seeds, which are snacked on, pressed for cooking oil, or offered as a treat for birds. Their value isn't a modern discovery—Native Americans cultivated them thousands of years ago. Sunflowers were often planted alongside corn, beans, and squash as a symbolic 'fourth sister,' reflecting their importance long before they became garden icons. The earliest evidence of domestication in the United States comes from Tennessee and dates back to around 2300 BCE. That long-standing legacy continues today, as sunflowers remain a staple in fields and backyards.

<summary>Description</summary>

> There's something timeless about Capitol Reef National Park—a place where red rock cliffs, winding canyons, and ancient stories come together under Utah's desert sky. Designated a national park in 1971, Capitol Reef invites reflection—not just on its vivid geology, but on the ancient narratives and cultural heritage etched into its landscape.
> 
> Long before visitors laced up hiking boots and hit the trails at Capitol Reef, the Fremont and Ancestral Puebloan peoples called this place home. Between 300 and 1300 CE, they lived in pit houses and natural rock shelters, weaving farming into their hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Their connection to the land was both spiritual and practical—and they left behind some of the park's most captivating features, including petroglyphs like those found in Fruita, featured in today's image. These rock panels showcase an ancient visual language, featuring human figures adorned with headdresses and jewelry. Alongside them are animals like bighorn sheep and lizards, as well as abstract shapes alluding to ceremonies, migrations, and celestial events. Together, they form a silent archive—a timeless record of the people who lived, moved, and made meaning in this extraordinary landscape.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Every August, Edinburgh stops being just a city and starts acting up—literally. From pub basements to park benches, stages appear in the strangest places, and shows pop up on quiet streets. Welcome to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, or the Fringe. The story began in 1947, when eight theater groups turned up uninvited to the Edinburgh International Festival. They performed anyway. That spirit of rebellion stuck, and the Fringe was born.
> 
> Now it's the world's largest arts festival, with thousands of shows crammed into three action-packed weeks. Anyone can perform. If you have an idea and a venue, you're in. Even a shipping container counts—yes, that really happened. Comedy is the unofficial king of the festival, but there's also drama, dance, drag, musicals, magic, mime, spoken word, circus, and acts that defy all categories. One year, a man did an hour-long monologue from inside a fridge. Another year featured a full Shakespeare play in Klingon. Street performers flood the Royal Mile, pictured here, offering sneak peeks, juggling acts, and flyers.  The Edinburgh Festival Fringe is where experimental performances and high-end theater thrive. It has launched careers: think of artists like Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Eddie Izzard.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
