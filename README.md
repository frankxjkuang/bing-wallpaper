> Fancy a walk through the Smokies in Tennessee, seen in today's image? Spanning over 522,000 acres between North Carolina and Tennessee, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a treasure trove of natural beauty and biodiversity. Home to more than 19,000 documented species, scientists estimate that tens of thousands more remain undiscovered. Miles of hiking trails wind through the dense woodlands, leading adventurers to cascading waterfalls and scenic overlooks. The park also boasts some of the highest mountains in the eastern United States, including Clingmans Dome, which rises to 6,643 feet. Visitors are often enchanted by the mist that blankets the peaks each morning, giving the park its mystical name. The park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and an International Biosphere Reserve.
> 
> In every season, it offers a unique spectacle: the wildflower bloom in spring, vibrant foliage in fall, and serene snow-covered landscapes in winter. Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a haven for nature lovers and adventurers alike, promising unforgettable experiences and a deeper connection to the natural world.

> Family gatherings wouldn't be the same without them. Today, we are celebrating the unique bond between cousins. Cousins Day offers the perfect opportunity to reminisce about those shared adventures, secrets, and the countless memories that have brought you closer together. First cousins share about 12.5% of their DNA; this could explain why you often have so much love and understanding with them. So, go ahead and make some plans with your cousins, whether it is a picnic or a shared meal at your favorite local haunt. And while you are at it, don't forget to pose for a photo, much like this group of Swaledale sheep in the North Yorkshire dales of England. Chances are, there are at least a few cousins in this flock.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Perched on a rocky headland is Methoni Castle, a symbol of medieval might on the shores of the Ionian Sea. The fortress, on the Peloponnese peninsula in southern Greece, was built by the Venetians in the early 13th century as a trading post and defensive bastion, protecting the coastline from invaders. Its Bourtzi tower, an extension of the fortress standing on a small islet, was once connected to the main castle by a stone bridge.
> 
> Many conquerors, from the Ottomans in 1500 to the French in 1828, aimed to win Methoni's strategic position. Some original structures, like the castle itself, still stand, allowing visitors to walk through the same gates where soldiers once marched. The village's blend of architecture, with Byzantine, Venetian, and Ottoman influences, narrates a storied past where European powers battled for dominance.

> Imagine swaying gently under a canopy of leaves, a soft breeze coaxing you into a serene slumber while you gaze at the stars above. Observed every July 22, Hammock Day is not just a nod to the lazy lull of summer days, but an homage to an ancient tradition. Invented by the Indigenous peoples of Central and South America, hammocks were called 'hamacas' and were originally woven for sleep and relaxation.
> 
> Back then hammocks were made from tree bark, whereas now they can be made of various materials like cotton, nylon, and canvas. These sleeping swings have crossed oceans as beds for sailors, swung from the trees, and nowadays, add a touch of chill to hip outdoor retreats. They have health benefits, too; gentle rocking can improve your sleep and even relieve stress. So go ahead, jump into a hammock, and let it sway your worries away.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Off the coast of East Africa in the archipelago of Zanzibar is the village of Kendwa. This serene village plays a modest role in the islands' fishing industry, with traditional wooden boats, known as dhows, etching patterns across the waters. The local dhow builders offer a glimpse into an artisanal craft that has sailed through generations. Venture deeper and you'll find lush spice farms where the air tingles with the scent of nutmeg and black pepper. Here, traditional Swahili dishes, including nyama choma, a roasted meat dish, and samaki wa kaupaka, fish with coconut sauce, blend spices with the bounty of the sea and land. As the sun sets, bonfires flicker into life and the island pulses with Taarab, a fusion of African, Arabic, and Indian music. With so much to see, Zanzibar proves that variety really is the spice of life.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we're celebrating small steps and giant leaps—it's International Moon Day. This day honors the legacy of the Apollo 11 mission. Initially celebrated as National Moon Day, it was recognized by the United Nations in 2021. Human civilizations have gazed at the sky for millennia, contemplating the origins and mysteries of the moon. The advent of space exploration transformed it into the target of numerous missions.
> 
> On July 20, 1969, the pioneering Apollo 11 space mission culminated in astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin taking the first steps on the moon. Moon Day commemorates this historic event, and the significant efforts required to launch the space program. Moon missions have found no signs of life, but it could be a future site for human colonization. The discovery of water ice, especially in the dark craters at the poles, makes it more hospitable for potential settlers. So, until you have a chance to live there, keep dreaming under the same moon that has captivated humanity since time immemorial.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Spot the wildlife star in today's image. The jaguar is the largest cat in the Americas and is seen here in the world's largest tropical wetland, the Pantanal in Brazil. Jaguars arrived in the Americas some 2 million years ago, migrating from Eurasia through the Bering Strait. Today, they live in various habitats from the woodlands of the southwestern US to the rainforests of northern Argentina. Brazil is home to about half of the world's wild jaguars.
> 
> Often found near bodies of water, jaguars are excellent swimmers, ambushing prey by leaping into the water. They feed on a wide range of animals, including deer, armadillos, monkeys, and lizards and their strong teeth and jaws can bite through turtle shells. In the Brazilian Pantanal, a population of jaguars feeds on aquatic reptiles and fish. So, the next time you are on a jungle trail, keep your eyes peeled and your senses sharp: Every rustle of leaves could be a jaguar on the prowl.

Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
