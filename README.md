<summary>Description</summary>

> After months of eating, roaming, and avoiding predators, Alaska moose spend autumn trying to propagate the species during what is called the rutting season, which runs from late September to early October. Males, called bulls, will mark their scent on trees to attract females. They’ll also fight other bulls for access to females, called cows.
> 
> Fights between bulls can sometimes be fatal, and occasionally a bull will have to wait until next year's rut to mate if it loses a fight. Virtually all cows have only one mate per year, but bulls can mate with 25 cows over a 12-month period.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Travel back 199 million years with a trip to the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site, a 95-mile-long stretch of coastline in southern England. This stunning fossil display is known as the Ammonite Pavement, where thousands of ammonite fossils are embedded in a limestone ledge at the west end of Monmouth Beach in Dorset. Although the ammonites look rather like snail shells, these are fossils of extinct sea creatures that are more closely related to today's octopus or squid. Britain's Natural History Museum notes that the fossil-filled ledge is unique in the world because of the sheer number and size of the ammonites: The fossils reach up to 27 inches in diameter. If you want to check them out, timing is everything—the ledge emerges at low tide, and there are more ammonites in large rocks nearby, too.
> 
> Today is National Fossil Day, when we celebrate the fascinating world of extinct creatures and plants. It's no coincidence that it falls during Earth Science Week: We can learn more about our planet and all living things from this visible, touchable legacy of our past.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> You may be surprised to learn that this elegant plant dappled with water droplets is a variety of moss: Tortula muralis, better known as wall screw-moss. It's found all over the world, even in urban areas where more sensitive mosses have a hard time thriving because of dry soil and air pollution. Mosses in general are accurate monitors of air pollution—they absorb air and water, so contaminants can also be measured in their cells.
> 
> Wall screw-moss is just one of at least 12,000 species of moss, ancient plants that date back 450 million years. The hardy bunch has weathered climate swings for eons, capable of surviving in icy tundra or scorching desert plains. They don't have roots—instead, they absorb moisture through hairlike rhizoids (which also act as anchors) on their surface. This ability to suck in water so efficiently makes mosses among the first plants to recover from forest fires or extreme heat, spreading out to stabilize the soil and keep it hydrated for other plants.
> 
> How appropriate, then, that our photograph captured raindrops on the moss. This is a perfect example of what's known as macro photography, when the image is many times larger than life-size. All the better to enjoy the delicate beauty of nature.

<summary>Description</summary>

> We're celebrating Indigenous Peoples' Day by peering through the sculpture called 'Circle of Sacred Smoke' aka 'Wind Circle' or 'Circle Wind' at Devils Tower, one of the most famous rock monoliths in the US. The 'Circle,' sculpted by Japanese artist Junkyu Muto and installed in 2008, is the third of seven 'peace sculptures' placed around the world. Twelve feet high and made of white marble, it's intended to evoke a puff of smoke from a Native American ceremonial pipe.
> 
> Devils Tower is a majestic Wyoming butte considered sacred by Indigenous tribes of the Great Plains like the Cheyenne, Crow, Lakota, and Kiowa. In myth, Devils Tower is associated not with the devil but with a great bear: Crow and Cheyenne names for it translate to Bear's House, Bear's Lodge, or Bear's Lair. The vertical grooves in the tower are said to be the bear's claw marks.

> Hundreds of shades of blue are marbled together in this cool shot. No, it's not a work of modern art, it's right off the brush of nature. This is a satellite photo of phytoplankton blooming near Alaska as the cool, salty Chukchi Sea mingles with warmer, fresher water closer to shore.
> 
> But just what are phytoplankton? They're microscopic sun-powered organisms that float near the surface of the ocean, drifting with the currents. In fact, their name derives from the Greek 'phyton' for plant and 'planktos' for wanderer or drifter. Delicious and nutritious to various creatures living in oceans and estuaries, they're also vital to everyone on Earth: Phytoplankton are responsible for about half of the world's photosynthesis, the sun-powered process that takes in carbon dioxide and releases oxygen.
> 
> We're talking phytoplankton today in honor of Earth Science Week, an international event encouraging all of us to learn about or even devote our lives to the Earth sciences. This year's theme is 'Earth Science for a Sustainable World,' emphasizing science's role in sustaining our planet. So, time to dust off that microscope and visit your local science museum, or perhaps just learn more about beautiful, swirling phytoplankton.

<summary>Description</summary>

> One of the least understood of sea creatures, this glass octopus lives in the depths of the ocean where sunlight can't reach, about 3,000 feet down. Glass octopuses are rarely seen and difficult to observe, but they're a great example of the diversity of the order Octopoda, which we're celebrating today on World Octopus Day. The observance comes around, appropriately, every Oct 8.
> 
> The more we learn about octopuses, the more fascinating they reveal themselves to be. They're among the most intelligent and behaviorally diverse creatures in the sea. Octopuses can remember and recognize individual humans and are among the very few animals known to be able to use tools. Some, like the giant Pacific octopus, are enormous, and some are tiny. They live in a variety of habitats, from tidal pools to the deepest abyss of the ocean.
> 
> In the darkness where they live, glass octopuses are nearly invisible, which helps them elude predators like bottlenose whales. Only their eyes give them away. The species is relatively small, with a mantle (the bulbous 'head' that houses the animal's organs) about 4 inches long and a total length of about 18 inches. And their lives, like those of most octopus species, are brief—just a few years. They grow quickly, mature early, reproduce, and die soon after that, never seeing the light of day.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The double-decker Oberbaum Bridge is one of Berlin's most beloved and iconic landmarks. For centuries the Oberbaum Bridge connected the two districts of Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg until they were separated by the Berlin Wall from 1961 to 1989. The first bridge at this spot was built in the 1700s, although the current road-and-rail Oberbaum was constructed at the end of the 19th century.
> 
> It remains an important symbol of unified Berlin, and a prominently featured landmark in the city's annual, weeklong Festival of Lights, which begins today. The international festival, now in its 18th year, transforms Berlin's buildings and landmarks with artful displays of light, as colors, patterns, and images are projected onto structures across the city. Here we see the Oberbaum all lit up for the 2020 festival—a far cry from its Cold War days. Despite growing concerns about an energy crisis in Germany this winter, Berlin's Festival of Lights will go on as planned in 2022, though in a scaled-down version, according to officials at the city government.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
