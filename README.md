<summary>Description</summary>

> Whooo is that up in that tree? Why, that's just a typical long-eared owl, sometimes called the lesser horned owl or cat owl. It's one of the most numerous owl species in the world with an estimated population between 2 million and 5.5 million long-eared owls widely distributed across the Northern Hemisphere. Our featured friend today was found in the Czech Republic, but they'll adapt to several kinds of habitats.
> 
> Maybe that adaptability is why they're unusually social, as far as owls go. They'll often roost together in large groups—anywhere from 20 to 100 of them may hunker down together for the winter. You might think it would be easy to see such a large group of owls, but long-eared owls are sneaky. They hide in thick cover, which makes them harder to find, especially when their feathers blend in with the surrounding branches and foliage. Early spring, before the leaves have fully returned, is the most likely time you'd catch a glimpse of a 'parliament,' or group, of long-eared owls.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The sheer size of Greenland is hard to put in perspective. The world's largest island is more than 836,000 square miles—that's more than three times the size of Texas and 170,000 square miles larger than Alaska. It is a land of deep fjords and thick ice that must have made the Norse explorers feel right at home when they landed there a thousand years ago.
> 
> Today we find ourselves at the southern tip of Greenland, in Prince Christian Sound, a fjord system 60 miles long, at times as narrow as 1,500 feet across. It flows through steep canyons of granite with slopes rising 1,200 feet above the water. The placid calm of these waters is frequently disrupted by calving glaciers, breaching whales, and the cruise ships that visit the region. The only human habitation in this frozen landscape is the Inuit village of Aappilattoq, home to about 100 people.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Naqsh-e Rostam is an ancient necropolis carved into the mountains of southwestern Iran, a porthole into one of the earliest civilizations to flourish in ancient Persia. The tombs of four Achaemenid kings (you can see three of them here) are marked by rock reliefs carved high above the ground into the cliff face. This site and the area around it are of huge significance to the history of Iran and its people. They're also a shining example of the role archaeology plays in understanding our past. On the third Saturday of every October, we pause to celebrate and recognize the contributions of archaeologists as interpreters of human history.
> 
> 'Necropolis,' the word for a complex of tombs and burial plots, literally translates as 'city of the dead.' This one is close to the ruins of the ancient Achaemenid ceremonial capital of Persepolis. One of the tombs is identified by an inscription as being the resting place of Darius I, aka Darius the Great, and the others are believed to be the tombs of Darius' son, Xerxes I, Artaxerxes I, and Darius II, leaders during the Achaemenid dynasty from 522-330 BCE. Naqsh-e Rostam is also home to relief carvings depicting kings of the later Sasanian Empire, the last Iranian empire before the Muslim conquests of the 7th and 8th centuries. Only a few hundred yards away is the archaeological site known as Naqsh-e Rajab, with more rock carvings depicting three Sassanid kings and a high priest. While these civilizations have faded, what they created endures as a permanent record of human history.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Striking in any season, but particularly beautiful in years when the warmth of summer stretches into fall, the Pyrenees have served as a natural border between the Iberian Peninsula and the rest of Europe since the earliest civilizations took root there. Located in the center of the range, Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park was created in 1918 and expanded in 1982. Today it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
> 
> Boasting sheer cliffs and deep, verdant valleys, the park is a photographer's dream, with a landscape defined by dramatic geological landforms and diverse ecosystems shaped by the drastic elevation changes of the Pyrenees. The region is home to several species that can only be found here, including the Pyrenean chamois and the Pyrenean desman, or water mole. The mammal considered the most rare and important in the region, the bucardo or Pyrenean ibex, went extinct in January 2000 despite preservation efforts.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> After months of eating, roaming, and avoiding predators, Alaska moose spend autumn trying to propagate the species during what is called the rutting season, which runs from late September to early October. Males, called bulls, will mark their scent on trees to attract females. They’ll also fight other bulls for access to females, called cows.
> 
> Fights between bulls can sometimes be fatal, and occasionally a bull will have to wait until next year's rut to mate if it loses a fight. Virtually all cows have only one mate per year, but bulls can mate with 25 cows over a 12-month period.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Travel back 199 million years with a trip to the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site, a 95-mile-long stretch of coastline in southern England. This stunning fossil display is known as the Ammonite Pavement, where thousands of ammonite fossils are embedded in a limestone ledge at the west end of Monmouth Beach in Dorset. Although the ammonites look rather like snail shells, these are fossils of extinct sea creatures that are more closely related to today's octopus or squid. Britain's Natural History Museum notes that the fossil-filled ledge is unique in the world because of the sheer number and size of the ammonites: The fossils reach up to 27 inches in diameter. If you want to check them out, timing is everything—the ledge emerges at low tide, and there are more ammonites in large rocks nearby, too.
> 
> Today is National Fossil Day, when we celebrate the fascinating world of extinct creatures and plants. It's no coincidence that it falls during Earth Science Week: We can learn more about our planet and all living things from this visible, touchable legacy of our past.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> You may be surprised to learn that this elegant plant dappled with water droplets is a variety of moss: Tortula muralis, better known as wall screw-moss. It's found all over the world, even in urban areas where more sensitive mosses have a hard time thriving because of dry soil and air pollution. Mosses in general are accurate monitors of air pollution—they absorb air and water, so contaminants can also be measured in their cells.
> 
> Wall screw-moss is just one of at least 12,000 species of moss, ancient plants that date back 450 million years. The hardy bunch has weathered climate swings for eons, capable of surviving in icy tundra or scorching desert plains. They don't have roots—instead, they absorb moisture through hairlike rhizoids (which also act as anchors) on their surface. This ability to suck in water so efficiently makes mosses among the first plants to recover from forest fires or extreme heat, spreading out to stabilize the soil and keep it hydrated for other plants.
> 
> How appropriate, then, that our photograph captured raindrops on the moss. This is a perfect example of what's known as macro photography, when the image is many times larger than life-size. All the better to enjoy the delicate beauty of nature.

Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
