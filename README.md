<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to the Totally Thames Festival in London, England. Each year, it brings together communities, artists, and nature enthusiasts in a month-long tribute to the river. Highlights for 2024 include the annual boat marathon, Great River Race, and the Clean Thames Challenge.
> 
> The Thames, the longest river entirely in England, contains more than 80 islands along its course. Starting in Gloucestershire and winding through cities like Oxford, Windsor, and in today's image, London, it flows for 215 miles before merging with the North Sea. With a range of freshwater and near seawater habitats, the river is a haven for an array of wildlife like mute swans and bottlenose dolphins. It also flanks several Sites of Special Scientific Interest. So, this month, let the river's tide guide you to discovery and celebration.

> From the Mediterranean coast to the vast Sahara, Algeria in North Africa has a wide variety of landscapes. Today, we're exploring the area around the Tassili n'Ajjer plateau. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is famed for its rock formations and cave art. More than 15,000 ancient engravings, some dating back 12,000 years, depict scenes of daily life, hunting, and mystical beings.
> 
> Djanet, a nearby oasis city, is known as the Jewel of the Desert. It is surrounded by rocky plateaus. Here, palm groves and gardens create a stark, beautiful contrast to the golden landscape. Djanet is home to roughly 15,000 people, most of whom belong to the Kel Ajjer Taureg community. You can get a feel for the city in its museum, or by wandering its streets, which are lined with colorful markets, mosques, and earthen houses.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we’re celebrating the world's largest fish, the whale shark. These gentle giants can grow up to 40 feet long, with one reaching a record 61.7 feet. Found in tropical oceans, these filter feeders glide through the water, mouths wide open, straining plankton and small fish. The patterns on their dotted, starry skin are as unique as a human fingerprint. Sadly, the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists whale sharks as endangered due to overfishing, habitat loss, and climate change.
> 
> Amid adversity, there is hope at places like Cenderawasih Bay in Indonesia, a whale shark oasis that's pictured here. At this bay, these titans dine on the generosity of fishermen who feed them baitfish for luck, reflecting a unique bond between man and marine life.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Perched on the edge of a basalt cliff above two rivers, today's image takes us to Castellfollit de la Roca, in the Spanish region of Catalonia. This town is not for the faint-hearted: There's a 160-foot drop down to the Toronell and Fluvia rivers, which converge at the base of the cliff. Many of the buildings, which are made of the same basalt that the town stands on, seem to teeter on the edge of the precipice. Pictured at the end of the crag is the 13th-century church of Sant Salvador.
> 
> Castellfollit de la Roca is inside the Zona Volcànica de la Garrotxa Natural Park, which contains around 40 extinct volcanoes. Although there haven't been any eruptions for around 11,000 years, the area is still considered seismically active. In 1428, a major earthquake struck the area, which was felt in Barcelona, over 50 miles away. The last seismic activity was registered in 1901 and 1902, when there were two minor earthquakes. These days, the park is a popular spot among hikers, who head to Garrotxa to enjoy the region's spectacular volcanic landscapes.

> The Summer Paralympic Games get underway in Paris today. Over 4,000 athletes with a range of disabilities from all around the world will meet in the French capital to compete across 549 different events. For its first time hosting the Summer Paralympics, the city has got something special in store for the opening ceremony. Delegations from 184 nations will parade down the iconic Champs-Élysées to the Place de la Concorde, rather than entering a stadium. The first official Paralympic Games were held in Rome in 1960. Twenty-three nations took part, competing in eight sports, including wheelchair basketball and Para athletics.
> 
> Today's image takes us to an icon of Parisian life: the Sacré-Cœur Basilica in the Montmartre neighborhood. The church, which was completed in 1914, stands at the top of one of the highest points in Paris. It offers impressive views over the city, taking in the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, the Panthéon, and much more. If you're in Paris to enjoy the Paralympics, it's the perfect spot to soak up the beauty of the host city.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today's image features a black caiman, South America's stealthy river giant, in the Tambopata National Reserve of Peru. These caimans are the largest species in the alligator family, growing up to 20 feet and weighing as much as 1,000 pounds. Their dark color helps them blend into the murky depths. These carnivorous creatures thrive in freshwater environments such as slow-moving rivers, lakes, and seasonally flooded savannas. From these waters, they hunt for birds, fish, turtles, and occasionally big mammals. Black caimans play an important role in making sure ecosystems stay balanced by keeping the populations of their prey under control. More caimans mean fewer piranhas, which attack cattle, and fewer capybaras, which can cause crop damage.

> Welcome to this eco-travelers' paradise in the middle of the Pacific. Situated halfway between Hawaii and American Samoa, the Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge was established in 2001 to conserve, manage, and restore the nation's fish, wildlife, plants, and habitats.
> 
> Home to a vast reef system, this atoll has three shallow lagoons, and numerous sandy and reef-rock islets with vegetation like coconut palms, Scaevola, and towering Pisonia trees. But wait, there's more. The lush greenery here is a bustling neighborhood that is home to over a million birds from 29 different species, like masked booby, great frigatebird, and sooty tern. It is also one of the few places outside the Galápagos Islands where red-footed boobies are found. There is a huge variety of marine wildlife in and around the atoll, including green sea turtles, hawksbill turtles, and the mighty coconut crab, the world's largest land invertebrate.
