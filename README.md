> Vast colonies of royal azaleas paint the sides of South Korea’s Hwangmaesan Mountain a vibrant purple as summer approaches. Sightseers flock to see this striking pink and purple carpet of flowers which was created gradually as dairy cows and sheep ate the grass and plants, but left behind the poisonous azaleas which spread across the mountain.
> 
> For those who want to climb it, Hwangmaesan also features massive rock formations, stunning views, and a legend that anyone who prays at the summit will have their wish granted. It reaches an altitude of around 3,650 feet and offers a peaceful escape from city life for hikers and campers. Those who want to walk among the azaleas should head there in May, when they come into bloom. But dress appropriately, it still gets chilly up at the summit.

> Contrary to what many people believe, Cinco de Mayo is not Mexico's Independence Day, which is celebrated on September 16. Instead, May 5 marks Mexico's victory over better-equipped French forces at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. Although the French Empire would counterattack and take the city a year later, the unexpected victory was a morale boost which still has symbolic significance. While in the US, Cinco de Mayo is a popular festival celebrating Mexican American culture, celebrations in Mexico are relatively quiet and focused mostly on Puebla.
> 
> In Mexico, the celebration became known as Battle of Puebla Day after President Benito Juárez declared it a national holiday in 1862. Today, the people of Puebla celebrate with parades, speeches, and battle reenactments. The Church of Nuestra Señora de los Remedios in Puebla, pictured here, was already nearly 300 years old when the 1862 battle was fought. And human history is just the blink of an eye to ancient Popocatépetl, the smoking volcano which towers over Puebla in the background of our homepage image.

> May the Fourth be with you! The 'Star Wars' universe has captured the imagination of fans for decades and its impact, like the 'Force,' is all around us. The original 1977 film introduced us to a galaxy far, far away, a cast of unforgettable characters, and a gripping battle between good and evil. Its reach has since extended to television, books, comics, theme parks, thousands of products, and a day of its own to celebrate the much-loved sci-fi franchise.
> 
> Fans might recognize today's image of the Mayan ruins in Tikal, Guatemala, as the rebel base on Yavin 4 from 'Star Wars: A New Hope.' These real-life temples served as a key setting in the cinematic Battle of Yavin, a fight so pivotal in the 'Star Wars' storyline that calendar years in the universe are called ABY or BBY: After the Battle of Yavin or Before the Battle of Yavin.

> Welcome to Kenya's Maasai Mara National Reserve, where some of its most iconic inhabitants are out for an evening stroll. Wildebeests, also known as gnus, are social animals which often form large herds. There are two types: black wildebeests and blue wildebeests and it is the latter which take part in the famous Great Migration, one of the world's greatest wildlife spectacles.
> 
> This typically starts in January or February and sees more than a million wildebeests, along with large herds of zebras and other species, migrate from the Serengeti in neighboring Tanzania to the Maasai Mara in search of water and greener pastures. They arrive in Kenya from late July and stay until November when they start moving south again, a round trip of some 500 miles. Tourists flock to the Maasai Mara to witness this incredible natural spectacle.

> Today we're exploring a place of otherworldly beauty: the Jöriseen, a group of alpine lakes near Davos, Switzerland. On sunny days, the lakes glow an ethereal blue, contrasting with the dark, jagged Silvretta Alps that encircle them. The sunlight is reflected in the water by 'rock flour'—silt-sized rock particles generated from the grinding of bedrock by glaciers.
> 
> The Silvretta Alps sit across the Swiss-Austrian border and are themselves surrounded by glaciers in an area known as the 'Blue Silvretta.' If you want to enjoy these stunning views up close, you'll have to work for it. Bring your best hiking boots, plenty of water, and some strong legs.

It's ringing in Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month, which starts today. The month was chosen in recognition of the first documented arrival of Japanese immigrants, on May 7, 1843, and the completion of the transcontinental railroad by more than 20,000 Asian immigrants on May 10, 1869.

> Born in the Black communities of New Orleans, jazz music quickly caught on outside the Big Easy and became an international sensation. Due to its improvisational nature, jazz never stays the same, fusing with other cultures and genres to create styles such as Afro-Cuban, Latin, and Indo Jazz. UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador and jazz pianist Herbie Hancock created International Jazz Day to celebrate the global genre, first held in 2012 with events in New York, Paris, and New Orleans. We hope you celebrate by putting on your favorite jazz record, or if you can swing it, visit New Orleans' legendary jazz venue, Preservation Hall, seen in our photo here.
