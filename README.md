> Today we visit the Museu do Amanhã (Museum of Tomorrow) in Rio de Janeiro to celebrate 200 years of Brazilian independence. Designed by Spanish neofuturist architect Santiago Calatrava, the unique structure was commissioned to showcase Rio's revitalized waterfront ahead of the 2016 Olympics. The museum comprises five main areas: Cosmos, Earth, Anthropocene, Tomorrow, and Us, each inviting visitors to interact in different ways and learn about living in a sustainable world.

> Brazil gained independence from Portugal just a few decades after the United States broke off from Great Britain, though it happened in a decidedly different way. Don Pedro I, first emperor of Brazil, was a member of the Portuguese ruling family (he would eventually briefly rule Portugal too). When Portugal threatened to take back the political autonomy Brazil had enjoyed since 1808, Pedro sided with his adopted homeland against the Portuguese. After a three-year war that was largely bloodless, the Empire of Brazil, which preceded the vibrantly diverse democracy we know today, was born on September 7, 1822.

> Oh, to be a squirrel with a feast such as this! It's National Mushroom Month, and it seems our red squirrel friend here in Alaska got a literal jump on celebrating. It might surprise you, but squirrels don't only eat nuts. They'll eat just about whatever's around and that includes big mushrooms. Though a small percentage of wild mushrooms can be poisonous to humans, squirrels can eat many of these frightening fungi without worry, thanks to special proteins in their guts. Nice to know someone's enjoying them.
> 
> Did you know the United States has a Mushroom Council? Since the early 1990s, the US Mushroom Council has worked as a Research and Promotion program of the Department of Agriculture. After an informal declaration during a Pennsylvania mushroom festival, the council proposed National Mushroom Month not just to highlight mushrooms as a culinary delicacy, but also showcase many other uses for the more than 900 million pounds of mushrooms the US produces each year. Believe it or not, we use mushrooms to build, clean, medicate, and even make leather—and so much more.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Our historical Labor Day photo shows striking textile workers taking to the streets of Gastonia, North Carolina, voicing their grievances and seeking support for their cause. By the time of this 1934 strike, the textile industry had been struggling for years to keep pace with the economic times, and workers were struggling as their wages were cut while their workloads increased. Things came to a head after the National Industrial Recovery Act became law in 1933, leading to the formation of the Textile Industry Committee meant to represent the interests of business owners, consumers, and workers—but this only led to shortened workweeks, effectively reducing wages by 25%. Workers rushed to join the United Textile Workers union to get their voices heard and demand improved conditions.
> 
> On Sept. 1, 1934, some 65,000 North Carolina textile workers stayed home, shuttering the state's mills. When this photo was taken on Sept. 3, the workers were hopeful that they could achieve change. The governor called out the National Guard to protect the mills, and a couple of weeks later the strike effort crumbled due to lack of union resources and a surplus of fabric on the market. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt did go on to appoint a committee to mediate the situation, and the consensus was that the textile workers' grievances had substance and should be investigated further. Unfortunately, the actual investigation never happened.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Known for its immense, densely populated cities, India also has a seemingly endless coastline. And no part of it is more languid and lovely than Arambol, in the small and special state of Goa on the southwestern coast. Arambol is a popular holiday town with the vibe of a sleepy fishing village—which it was once was. Now visitors from around the world are drawn to its tropical climate, rainforest valleys, historic architecture, and sandy beaches.
> 
> Goa is distinct from much of India as it was colonized by Portugal while Great Britain occupied the rest. The Portuguese Empire conquered Goa in the early 1500s and ruled it until 1961, when it was annexed by India. The influence of the Portuguese can be seen in Goa's Catholic churches and convents, as well as in the name of the state's largest city: Vasco da Gama, after the explorer who once governed Goa.
> 
> If history isn't your thing, Arambol is famous for a drum circle and flea market held on the beach a few hours before sunset. It's just as much a beach party as a market. Craftspeople sell handmade wares while musicians join impromptu performances. There's no better way to end your day in Goa, land of sand and spice and sun.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> The Petronas Twin Towers are the unmistakable calling card of the Malaysian capital city of Kuala Lumpur, affectionately called KL. The 88-story, 1,483-foot cylindrical towers were the tallest buildings in the world when they were completed in 1996, until 2004 when Taiwan's Taipei 101 topped them by almost 200 feet. Still the tallest twin skyscrapers in the world, they're our perfect inspiration today on Skyscraper Day, set aside to appreciate such engineering and architectural feats.
> 
> The Petronas Towers, named for Malaysia's state-owned oil and gas company, were designed by the late Argentine American architect César Pelli, who incorporated motifs of Islamic art into his postmodern design. It remains his masterpiece, and a true standout in a country and continent full of skyscrapers. One of the most notable features of the buildings is a two-level skybridge that connects the towers at the 41st and 42nd floors. The bridge is not actually anchored to the main structure, but freely slides into each tower to accommodate any swaying caused by wind.
> 
> The preponderance of supertall structures in Asia isn't a coincidence. Skyscrapers spring up where populations are high, land is in short supply, and economies flourish. Plus, for an up-and-coming city, nothing says you've arrived like a gleaming skyscraper—or a pair of them. And why stop there? Even the Petronas Towers, though emblematic of the KL skyline, are no longer the tallest kids on the block in Malaysia: A new skyscraper, the 2,227-foot Merdeka 118, is expected to be completed in 2023 as the second-highest building in the world.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Crete is the largest and most populous of all the Greek islands, and also the farthest from the mainland (in fact, it's just about halfway to Turkey). This big little island is small enough to drive across in a few hours but full of wonders, from mountain ranges to gorges to beautiful beaches. Take this jewel box of turquoise water near the port city of Chania, for example. Set on the easternmost of three peninsulas that stick out like horns from the northwest shoreline of Crete, Seitan Limania is one of the most photographed beaches on the island.
> 
> Seitan Limania is beautiful to behold from a distance but driving up close via the narrow switchback roads takes some nerve. And once you get to the parking lot, the rocky hike down is for only the most surefooted of beachgoers. On your way down, you'll likely meet some of the goats that populate the area. The narrow cove is flanked by steep rock walls that zig one way, then zag the other. When you reach the beach, you'll find yourself on one of the most beautiful spots on any coast—and a selfie here at Seitan Limania is hard to beat for bragging rights.

> Wildlife crossing in Wierden, Netherlands (© Frans Lemmens/Alamy)

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> It's not just chickens that cross the road. Wild creatures from frogs to elk roll the dice with death when they need to traverse the thousands of highways humans have threaded through wildlife habitat. Sadly, the dice don't fall favorably for millions of animals each year, and collisions with vehicles often cause fatalities for both them and the drivers who hit them.
> 
> Many countries now construct wildlife crossings—also called green bridges, ecoducts, natuurbrugs (like this one in Wierden in the Netherlands), and écoponts (in France). These can be either overpasses or underpasses, and they are an expensive venture. Are they worth it? Well, officials in Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada, would say categorically yes. Over 20 years they built 44 bridges and underpasses so wildlife could cross the Trans-Canada Highway, which divides the park; traffic accidents involving wildlife dropped by 80%.
> 
> France built the first overland wildlife crossings in the 1950s and continues to invest in many elaborate safe passageways. But the Netherlands leads the initiative, with an impressive 600-plus wildlife crossings, and counting. In fact, the Dutch can claim the honors for the world's longest animal crossing too—the Natuurbrug Zanderij Crailoo is an overpass that's half a mile long and 55 yards wide. Now chickens and their four-legged friends can cross the road anytime, no questions asked.

> 
> Solar Impulse 2 was the second aircraft built by Swiss aviators André Borschberg and Bertrand Piccard. Borschberg is an engineer by training, Piccard a psychiatrist and balloonist who copiloted the first balloon to fly around the world nonstop. The pair took turns piloting the aircraft, which can carry only one person, on a multi-leg, 16-month flight around the world that started and ended in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.
> 
> This image was taken during the final leg from Egypt to Abu Dhabi as Solar Impulse 2 flew over the Great Pyramids of Giza. The superlight plane was powered by thousands of solar cells mounted atop its fuselage and jumbo-jet sized wings. Batteries stored energy so it could fly at night. The going was slow by the standards of modern jet travel—Solar Impulse 2 flew at an average speed of 50 mph. Clearly, solar-powered flight on a commercial scale is still many years away, but as this photo shows, its Kitty Hawk moment is in the books.
