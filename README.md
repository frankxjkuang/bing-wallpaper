> Grab your flippers—it's World Dolphin Day, a day to celebrate and promote the conservation of these aquatic mammals. Dolphins are highly intelligent and can be found all over the world in oceans, rivers, and estuaries. But they are threatened by human activities, such as hunting, pollution, and fishing. Hunting in particular led to the creation of World Dolphin Day in 2022 by Sea Shepherd Global, an international marine conservation group.
> 
> The pod of dolphins seen in today's image was photographed near Réunion, an island in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Madagascar. Marine wildlife found year-round in Réunion's deeper waters include many types of sharks, orcas, humpback whales, sea turtles, and dolphins. The island's warm, tropical climate is ideal for these creatures, as well as spinner, bottlenose, and rough-toothed dolphins, which also swim in the island's crystal-clear waters.

> On Patriot Day, we are at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York City, where the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center once stood. The museum is 70 feet underground, beneath the memorial's waterfall pools in the footprints of the fallen towers. The names of those who died in the 2001 terrorist attacks and in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing are listed on bronze parapets surrounding these huge reflecting pools. Seven stories below the memorial, the museum tells the story of 9/11 through exhibits, artifacts, historical records, and personal accounts, remembering the victims and those who risked their lives to save others.
> 
> Patriot Day honors the 2,977 people killed in the September 11 attacks on the United States. In 2001, Congress passed the Patriot Day resolution, which calls for US flags to fly at half-staff and for a moment of silence at 8:46 AM EST.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This sleek structure is the Vasco da Gama Bridge, which appears to vanish into the horizon after crossing the Tagus River in Portugal. Stretching nearly 8 miles, it was Europe's longest bridge when it opened in 1998, built to ease traffic on Lisbon's 25 de Abril Bridge and make travel smoother between the north and south of Portugal. This cable-stayed bridge was designed to be earthquake and wind-resistant; its deck is not fixed to the pylons, and it can move both lengthwise and sideways. Its opening was perfectly timed for Expo 98, the World's Fair celebrating the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's historic sea route discovery from Europe to India.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to Iguazu Falls, the largest waterfall system in the world. The name 'Iguazu' has its origins in the regional languages Guarani or Tupi, meaning 'big water.' These epic waterfalls are formed by the Iguazu River, on the border of Argentina's Misiones province and Brazil's Paraná state.
> 
> The Iguazu Falls have long attracted admirers. Spanish explorer Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca is thought to have been the first European to see them in 1541. In 1907, businessman Domingo Ayarragaray saw their potential and built a hotel and roads nearby. The falls became such a sensation that they were designated as national parks in both countries—Argentina's Iguazu National Park in 1934 and Brazil's Iguaçu National Park in 1939. UNESCO made the parks World Heritage Sites in 1984 and 1986, respectively. Surrounded by the rainforest, the falls are made up of hundreds of cascades and channels carved over millions of years by the Iguazu River, the tallest of which is the U-shaped Devil's Throat, at 269 feet high.

> 'Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope.' These words by former UN chief Kofi Annan capture the essence of International Literacy Day, celebrated every September 8. Established by UNESCO in 1966, it promotes the importance of literacy as a matter of dignity and a human right. The UN estimates that at least 765 million adults worldwide cannot read and write, and millions of children are failing to learn basic literacy skills. We are marking the day with an image of the Stockholm Public Library in Sweden, or 'Stadsbiblioteket' as it is known to locals.
> 
> Here, more than 2 million volumes wait to unfold stories in over 100 languages. Designed by architect Erik Gunnar Asplund in the 1920s, the building is a towering cylinder inside a cube. The main lending library, pictured, is in the round room at the center, inviting readers into a literal circle of knowledge. On this day, let's join in a collective turning of pages in the pursuit of greater knowledge for all and creating a fairer and more literate society.

<summary>Description</summary>

> On the first Saturday in September, National Hummingbird Day celebrates these tiny, agile birds and their role as pollinators in our ecosystem. Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed; they can flap their wings up to 80 times per second, allowing them to hover and fly backward. Their high metabolism requires them to eat constantly, so they spend their days flitting from flower to flower, sipping nectar and catching insects. These birds can remember which flowers they've visited and how long they will take to refill with nectar.
> 
> Let's meet the Anna's hummingbird, seen in today's image. Named after Anna Masséna, Duchess of Rivoli, it's one of an estimated 366 hummingbird species, and it's among the most common hummingbirds on North America's west coast. With its shimmering emerald feathers and sparkling rose-pink throat, this little bird is a sight to behold. So, today, let's spread our wings of awareness and protect these birds—one garden at a time.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This storybook setting is Glenariff Forest Park in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, which spans nearly 3,000 acres of woodland and waterfalls. Among its popular walking trails is the Waterfall Walkway, a 3-mile trail that passes through a national nature reserve and past the Ess-na-Crub and Ess-na-Larach waterfalls. Glenariff is home to a rich diversity of wildlife including red squirrels, pine martens, and badgers. Birdwatchers will be delighted by willow warblers, chiffchaffs, and kingfishers. The flora is just as impressive, with trees like the old beech pictured here, oaks, birches, and rowans creating a lush canopy. It's the perfect spot for a bit of soul-searching beneath ancient branches in this beautiful landscape known as the 'Queen of the Glens.'

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
