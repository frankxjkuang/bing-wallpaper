<summary>Description</summary>

> Lake Bled in Slovenia gets plenty of attention in summer, but winter? That's when things slow down in the best way. The lake's emerald waters take on a softer tone, and Bled Island, with its quaint church, looks straight out of a winter fairytale, as seen in today's image. The 1.3-mile lake, surrounded by the snow-dusted Julian Alps, was formed over 14,000 years ago through glacial and tectonic activity. The first signs of settlement on Bled Island date back to the New Stone Age (10,000 BCE to 3,000 BCE). Additionally, archaeologists uncovered an Early Medieval graveyard here from the 9th century CE. Today, it houses the Church of the Assumption—built in its current form near the end of the 17th century—where visitors ring the 'wishing bell' for good luck.
> 
> When you're here, don't let the cold keep you indoors. Take a walk around the lake, ride the traditional boat, called a pletna, to Bled Island, or head up to Bled Castle for sweeping views of the town. Feeling adventurous? There are plenty of ski slopes not far from the lake. And before you go, treat yourself to a slice of Bled cream cake—yes, it's famous for a reason, and no, you won't regret it.

> As the last notes of Christmas carols linger in the air, Boxing Day arrives. This day is celebrated in the United Kingdom, Canada, and several Commonwealth countries. In the past, it was customary for the wealthy to give boxes filled with gifts to their servants on the day after Christmas. The tradition evolved into a day for charitable giving to the less fortunate. Today, while the spirit of giving remains, it has transformed into a holiday about enjoying bustling sales and a lineup of soccer matches.
> 
> Let's visit the harbor of Mousehole, a fishing village in Cornwall, England, to keep the merriment going. Featured in today's image, Mousehole harbor is known for its Christmas illuminations. The Mousehole lights were first lit in the early 1960s, thanks to local artist Joan Gillchrest. A few humble strings of lights soon turned into a full-blown spectacle, growing over the years to include iconic scenes, nautical motifs, and Cornish themes. Today, the lights, switched on from December until early January, span the entire harbor, wrapping buildings, boats, and even the water's edge in a soft glow.

> Deck the halls, it's Christmas time! Christmas Day is a holiday packed with joy, warmth, and cherished traditions. For many, it's a celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ, bringing family and friends together to exchange gifts, share meals, and enjoy festive décor. Beyond its spiritual roots, Christmas also lights up the season with beloved customs—decorating trees, caroling, and eagerly awaiting Santa's arrival. These traditions, blending both old and new, make the holiday a magical experience filled with connection and cheer.
> 
> Spotted in Norway's stunning Van Mijenfjorden National Park, the Svalbard reindeer is a remarkable Arctic creature adapted to life in extreme cold. These short-legged and stocky animals have thick winter coats that help them brave the harsh climate. Once almost extinct due to overhunting, their numbers have rebounded to around 22,000, making them the only large grazing mammal in the European High Arctic. Their resilience adds to the natural wonder of this frozen landscape and the magic of the holiday season, where reindeer have long been represented as Santa's loyal companions, spreading festive cheer across the world.

> 'A Festivus for the rest of us!' This is the unofficial motto of a non-commercial alternative to Christmas. Celebrated on December 23, Festivus was popularized by the TV show 'Seinfeld,' although it was actually invented by the family of one of the series' writers. The celebration centers around the unadorned aluminum Festivus pole. After dinner, the traditional Festivus 'airing of grievances' gets underway. This consists of telling friends and family the ways they've disappointed you over the year. This can provide some much-needed catharsis at what can be a stressful time of year. The day traditionally concludes with feats of strength. Once the head of the household has been pinned, Festivus is officially over. Those who embrace this farcical holiday welcome the opportunity to let off some steam amid the Christmas build-up chaos—much like these red-crowned cranes in Hokkaido, Japan.

> Santa has plenty of runway to land, but good luck trying to find a chimney. Today, we're getting ready for Christmas at Pacific Beach in San Diego, California. While it might not snow here, there's still plenty of yuletide spirit leading up to Christmas in sunny Southern California. Among many beautiful examples on San Diego's Christmas Tree Trail is the 20-foot tree at the end of a festively decorated Crystal Pier.
> 
> Stretching out 872 feet into the water, the family-owned pier has been a Pacific Beach icon since 1927. Once home to a ballroom and carnival-like midway, Crystal Pier has since become a mellower vacation destination and one of the few places on the West Coast with rental accommodations over the ocean. Open to the public during the day and 24/7 for hotel guests, the pier is an ideal place to take in panoramic coastal views, watch whales and surfers at play, do some fishing, or bathe in glorious coastal sunsets. Pacific Beach also has a lively restaurant, bar, and club scene if eggnog isn't your thing. There are certainly colder places to spend Christmas, but perhaps no place cooler than Crystal Pier.

> The winter solstice is here. Today marks the shortest day in the Northern Hemisphere, while last night was the longest night of the year. This has been an important event for millennia, with evidence of celebrations going back as far as 10,000 BCE. Some of the world's most famous Stone Age monuments, including Stonehenge, are aligned with the point that the sun rises or sets on the winter solstice. Traditionally, it was a time for feasting and lighting of fires to symbolize the darkest day of the year. Ancient Germanic tribes celebrated the winter solstice by bringing evergreens into their homes as a symbol of the returning light and the coming spring.
> 
> Today's image takes us to modern-day Germany. Here we can see the Loisach, a river in Bavaria, and the solstice sun just peeking out from behind the Bavarian Alps. In many parts of Germany, the winter solstice is celebrated as Thomastag. Traditions on this day include trying to predict the future for the year ahead and getting up early to work. From today, the evenings will start to get shorter, and the days will slowly but surely get lighter. Happy midwinter!

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
