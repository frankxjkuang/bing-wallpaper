> On the International Day of the Tropics, we are in the Banyak Islands of Indonesia, a group of more than 70 islands, most of which are uninhabited and unnamed. The Banyak Islands offer miles of pristine sandy beaches, lush green trees, and clear waters as far as the eyes can see. This tropical paradise also boasts some great surfing and snorkeling spots and draws millions of visitors a year.
> 
> But the tropics, roughly defined as the area above and below the equator between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn, face various challenges including climate change, urbanization, and high levels of poverty. They also make up approximately one-third of the Earth’s landmass and are home to about 40% of the world’s population. On June 29, International Day of the Tropics celebrates the uniqueness and biodiversity of the tropics, while highlighting their challenges and progress made to address them.

> On June 28, 1969, protests erupted over a police raid at the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich Village in New York. This watershed moment—at a time when homosexuality was still illegal in most US states—launched an era of activism and resistance that would transform into a celebration of LGBTQIA+ love and pride. Today, Pride Month is observed in the United States and in dozens of countries around the world. Taking place every June, the month-long celebration of LGBTQIA+ communities also highlights their struggles and achievements. The goal of Pride is to promote the acceptance of love in all its forms, so that LGBTQIA+ communities have the respect, dignity, and equality they deserve.

> Stunning sandstone cliffs rise from the desert floor amid spectacular scenery here in Sedona, Arizona, also known as Red Rock Country. Adventure enthusiasts come to enjoy the beautiful trails that dot the region, which is also steeped in Native American history. The earliest settlers are believed to have been the Ancestral Puebloans, who inhabited the area around 1,400 years ago. Without any written history, most of the information about these ancient people comes from the archaeological ruins that remain, including cliff dwellings built under overhangs in the area's red sandstone rocks. Other Native American groups came to the area such as the Hakataya, the Hohokam, the Sinagua, and the modern-day tribes that live in Arizona today, the Tonto Apache and the Yavapai.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The Château de Villandry in France is renowned for its exquisite gardens that are considered a masterpiece of Renaissance horticulture. The gardens, which are divided into sections, feature geometric patterns, vibrant flowerbeds, serene water elements, and meticulously trimmed hedges. Each section has its own theme, ranging from ornamental to practical, and is bursting with a stunning blend of colors and textures. The château's gardens showcase the harmonious relationship between architecture and nature. Stunning gardens have surrounded the château since it was built in 1532, but their appearance changed drastically over the centuries. After Joachim Carvallo acquired the estate, he spent 10 years from 1918 reinventing and restoring the Renaissance formal gardens. Other elements have been added in the decades since and the gardens continue to captivate visitors to this day.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to the ancient temple of Al-Khazneh in the desert city of Petra, Jordan. Carved out of a single sandstone rock about 2,000 years ago by the Nabataean people, it is believed to have been a mausoleum for King Aretas IV. Standing 141 feet tall, its massive doorway is framed with towering columns and intricate carvings. It is the most recognizable structure of this 'rose city' of temples and tombs carved from pink sandstone.
> 
> The Nabataeans, the original inhabitants of Petra, were skilled architects who built an impressive network of cisterns and water channels here. Once a thriving center, Petra is thought to have been largely abandoned around the 8th century and was 'lost' to the Western world until the 19th century. Only the Bedouin people, who lived in the surrounding desert, knew of it, and it is they who are thought to have named it Al-Khazneh, believing it contained treasures.

> It's lunch time for these beautiful monarch butterflies, which like to feed on clusters of colorful wildflowers. While they dine out on nectar, they get a light dusting of pollen, which is then spread to other flowers they land on. This process is pollination, transferring pollen from the male part of a flower to the female part, and is crucial for growing many of our fruits and vegetables. It improves the quality and quantity of crops and increases harvest yields. Nearly $20 billion of goods are produced in the US alone each year, because of pollination.
> 
> Pollinators are a critical part of food systems and ecosystems, but their numbers have declined due to various threats including loss of habitats, pesticides, and climate change. Pollinator Week, held in June each year, aims to raise awareness of pollinators and what we can do to protect them. You can mark the week by avoiding using pesticides and creating a pollinator-friendly habitat for butterflies, bees, and other pollinators, helping them continue to play their essential role in plant reproduction.
