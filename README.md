<summary>Description</summary>

> On the shore of Hudson Bay, the Canadian town of Churchill, Manitoba is remote, but the sights are worth the journey. From beluga whales and northern lights to the shipwreck of the SS Ithaka and the Sea Walls murals, there are many surprises here. Moreover, it is also known as the 'polar bear capital of the world', thanks to its seasonal visitors. From October to November, these white giants pass through, waiting for Hudson Bay to freeze over so they can head out to hunt seals. Tourists can safely watch polar bears from the comfort of custom-built vehicles and a so-called 'polar bear jail' helps to manage bear-human interactions. Are you ready for a wild adventure that'll send chills down your spine, but in a good way?

> Take a hike, buddy! No, not the 'get out of here' version but the 'get out there' version. It's time to lace up those boots and take advantage of our national trails, which span over 91,000 miles. Back in the 1960s, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the National Trails System Act into law, to preserve, promote, and develop scenic and historic trails across the country. Can't decide where to start? Our homepage image offers up one option which is awash with fall colors—Copper Falls State Park in Wisconsin. With 17 miles of trails along the Bad River, past waterfalls and ancient lava flows, this park has a lot to offer. Whether it's a rugged mountain path, a serene forest walk, or an oceanside stroll, this country has a trail waiting for you. But remember to respect nature, follow 'leave no trace' principles, and take nothing but photographs. Happy hiking!

> On World Philosophy Day, we're in Athens, the capital of Greece, the birthplace of Western philosophy and democracy. The iconic Acropolis, the ancient citadel that towers over Athens, and its most famous monument, the Parthenon, remind us of the brilliant minds of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Ancient Greek philosophy focused on critical thinking and questioning and started a revolution of rationale that is still shaping our society today. UNESCO recognizes the profound impact philosophy has on human thought, cultures, and individuals on World Philosophy Day. Take time today to discover the depths of the 'love of wisdom'!

> Rapa Valley runs through Sarek National Park in northern Sweden, where rivers cut into lush meadows and towering peaks reach towards the sky. In this national park, covering about 760 square miles of pristine wilderness, elk roam freely, golden eagles soar overhead, and the elusive arctic fox leaves traces of its presence in the snow. From the beauty of Abisko to the rugged peaks of Sarek, Sweden's many national parks boast a range of landscapes from glaciers to lush green forests and sandy beaches. The Sámi people have called this alpine region home since ancient times, and their cultural heritage is intertwined with the landscape. They fish the coasts, and perhaps most famously, herd reindeer.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to Lake Tekapo, on New Zealand's South Island, where the colorful spikes of flowering Russell lupines transform the landscape each November and December. The plants' blooming heads, made up of clusters of pea-like flowers, can reach up to 60 inches. While photographers flock here to capture the varied hues of purple, blue, and yellow, these striking plants are controversial. Native to North America, they are considered an invasive species here, growing in dense stands and boxing out other flora. While these plants might be appealing to tourists, they can create a negative imbalance in the region's ecosystem.

<summary>Description</summary>

> They've been growing olives on the Spanish island of Majorca in the western Mediterranean for more than 2,000 years. Early settlers, the Phoenicians and Greeks, introduced the first olive trees but the groves in the Serra de Tramuntana range expanded during Spain's Islamic era, between 709 and 1492. Olive oil became a crucial ingredient in culinary traditions on Majorca, the largest of the Balearic Islands. One ancient tree on the island, Can Det, is estimated to be more than 1,100 years old, and is still producing olives.

> In 2011, the Serra de Tramuntana was established as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Today, tourists from all over the world visit the archipelago to taste history and the 'liquid gold.'
