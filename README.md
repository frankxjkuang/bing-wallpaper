<summary>Description</summary>

> Beautiful, historic Rovinj dips into the Adriatic like a toe testing the water. The 200-foot-tall bell tower of the Church of St. Euphemia overlooks Rovinj's historic center. The church, which was built in the early 1700s over the remains of older Christian holy structures, acts as a beacon that welcomes home the town's fleet of fishing boats each evening.
> 
> More than 2,000 years old, Rovinj was once an island—it wasn't connected to the mainland until 1763, when the narrow channel was filled in. Today the city's economy comes from tourism, and the romantic cobblestone streets are home to numerous bars, restaurants, and museums. It's on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites and is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Istria.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The largest heron in North America, the great blue heron makes its nest in a 'basket' made from twigs, usually placed high in a tree. The herons line the interior with moss, leaves, grass, and other softer materials, and tend to return to the same nesting site each year, though not the same nest. The male heron finds building materials while the female assembles the nest, then both birds maintain and add to it. The helpful male heron shown here is presenting his mate with nesting material—he seems an apt mascot for this year's Giving Tuesday.
> 
> Always observed on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving in the US, Giving Tuesday began in 2012. It has since spread around the globe, as other countries have embraced the idea. The purpose of the observance is to encourage everyone to set aside some time to do something good for others. So this year, after you've finished your shopping, think about contributing to your favorite nonprofit, giving to someone in need, or just helping someone build their nest.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> About 140 million miles away from Earth, the most relatable planet in the solar system orbits the sun. Mars, popularly known as the Red Planet, is the fourth planet from the sun, after Mercury, Venus, and Earth. We know more about Mars than any other planet but our own. That knowledge has been gained over centuries and has grown exponentially in recent years with the successful landings on Mars of the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers in 2012 and 2021 respectively. Today we celebrate those and other accomplishments on Red Planet Day, which coincides with the launch of Mariner 4, the first probe sent to Mars, on this day in 1964.
> 
> Mars was observed in ancient times as a bright and moving object in the night sky, distinct from the stars. Even its reddish tint was observed by the naked eye. Our curiosity was cemented.  It might not be the planet closest to ours—Venus owns that title—but it seems to be the planet that most captures our imagination. The more we learn, the more we can imagine that Mars might have been just like Earth a long time ago, possessing organic life, rivers and oceans, and a much thicker atmosphere than it does today. Current conditions on Mars, while not exactly habitable, are hospitable by comparison to those on other planets, maybe the most compelling reason we're inclined to imagine that living on the Red Planet might someday be possible.

<summary>Description</summary>

> No doubt your eyes are drawn to the large, silver-bluish leaf in today's photo, but there's a little more to this colorful display. We're on the floor of a Mexican rainforest to examine a large Cecropia leaf and some lobster claw petals. The genus called Cecropia contains some of the most recognizable neotropical trees anywhere, but the roughly 60 different species can be hard to tell apart. All Cecropias grow fast, by tree standards anyway. On average, they'll climb about 2.5 feet per year and under perfect conditions can grow as much as 10 feet in that time, eventually reaching around 60 feet tall. When dried, Cecropia leaves shrivel into a fist-like form which displays interesting patterns and shapes. Not only are Cecropias very popular with animals like sloths, monkeys, and toucans for their fruit and leaves, many species have a symbiotic relationship with Azteca ants. Cecropias provide shelter and food for ants, and the ants in turn defend the trees from plant-eating predators.
> 
> The other striking leaves here are cup-shaped flower petals of the hanging lobster claw plant, or what botanists call the Heliconia rostrata. With its bright colors and distinctive shape, the lobster claw is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for tropical gardens. Gardeners looking to attract birds love the Heliconia because its plentiful nectar draws hummingbirds to its downward-facing flowers. Those same flowers have special recognition in Bolivia as 'patujú,' the national flower, which appears on one of the country's flags.

<summary>Description</summary>

> While not everyone would recognize this as an olive tree, most of us understand the meaning of the phrase 'extending an olive branch,' long known as a gesture of peace and friendship. That sentiment of compassion, harmony, and wisdom is at the heart of UNESCO's World Olive Tree Day, created in 2019 and observed every November 26. The intent of the day is to bring attention to the resolution of conflict worldwide and to the preservation of the olive tree itself, like this one standing in front of the Temple of Concordia in Agrigento, Italy. The well-preserved, Greek Doric temple was built on what is now the south shore of Sicily, around 440 BCE. Olive trees are native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and are cultivated today in places with similar climates, like parts of California and Israel. About 90% of harvested olives are used to make olive oil, the quintessential ingredient in Mediterranean cooking.
> 
> The cultivation of olives is about as old as human civilization itself, as are some of the trees themselves. Although olive trees do not grow very tall, usually no more than 30 feet, they live a very long time. One of the oldest known trees in the world, in Portugal, is believed to be 3,350 years old. Many live for millennia, their trunks growing thick and gnarled, and their branches bearing fruit century after century. As civilizations rise and fall around them, these hardy trees remain resilient and steadfast.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we mark Native American Heritage Day and Month with the imposing pyramid now known as Monks Mound, once the center of a city that rivaled any European city of the age in population. Built by people of the Mississippian culture, construction of Monks Mound began early in the 900s CE in present day southern Illinois. By around 1050 the area had grown into a major hub of commerce and agriculture now known as Cahokia. With a population that may have exceeded 40,000 at its peak, Cahokia was the largest urban center north of the great Mesoamerican cities of Mexico and Central America. In the 13th century, for reasons still debated by scholars, the city began to decline, and it was abandoned around 1350. Excavations in the 19th and 20th century revealed a society far more sophisticated and complex than many had believed existed north of Mesoamerica previously.
> 
> Native American Heritage Month celebrates the rich traditions, languages, and stories of Native American, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and Island communities.  Public schools are encouraged to enhance student understanding of Native Americans by providing classroom instruction focusing on Indigenous history, achievements, and contributions, while many government institutions make efforts to recognize the contributions of the first Americans.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Whether made from scratch or plopped out of a can, your cranberry sauce started in a bog like the one seen here. Cranberry shrubs are planted in beds surrounded by dikes. Once the fruit ripens in the fall, the beds are flooded with water, creating bogs full of submerged shrubs. A harvester machine dislodges the berries, which float to the top of the water. Then they're easily corralled on the surface with flexible booms.
> 
> The very sour cranberries will need to be further processed, with lots and lots of sugar, to be palatable as turkey's best friend on the Thanksgiving table. Cranberries grow wild in the wetlands of North America and were an important food for Native Americans, who used them to make pemmican, a nutritious paste of berries, dried meat, and fat. Today, the US accounts for more than half of commercially grown cranberries in the world.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
