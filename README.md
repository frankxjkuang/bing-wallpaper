> As flowers start to bloom, you'll hear the soft hum of bees buzzing between them, drinking nectar, and gathering pollen to take back to their hives. Some pollen grains on their bodies get carried between flowering plants, helping them to reproduce, yield better crops, and support other species. The UN proclaimed May 20 as World Bee Day to highlight the importance of these pollinators and the threats they face, including habitat loss, climate change, and pesticide use. Busy bees attend to over 90% of the world’s top 107 crops and are vital to our food supply, but populations worldwide have declined. So today, let's support our industrious friends to help them go about their important work in peace.

> Sumatran rhinos like this one were once plentiful across the forests and swamps of Southeast Asia. But there are thought to be fewer than 80 alive today, surviving only on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Borneo. Logging and hunting have led to their inclusion on the ‘red list’ of more than 42,100 critically endangered species. This one is pictured in Way Kambas National Park, Sumatra, where a rhino sanctuary is home to a tiny population and is the center of a breeding and research program.

> Endangered Species Day highlights the thousands of animals and plants under threat of extinction, as well as conservation success stories. Humpback whales, gray wolves, tigers, and bald eagles have all seen population increases, thanks to conservation efforts. It’s now 50 years since the US passed the Endangered Species Act, a powerful wildlife conservation law. But while it is said to have saved 99 percent of species it protects, the challenges remain — habitat loss, invasive species, and climate change are among ongoing threats. The work continues to bring more animals and plants back from the brink.

> For International Museum Day, we’re featuring the towering aluminum-clad Plaza Carso building, part of the Museo Soumaya in Mexico City. It was built to house Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim’s vast art collection, which includes the largest collection of sculptures by Auguste Rodin outside France. The building, designed by Fernando Romero, is a sculpture in itself. Covered in 16,000 hexagonal aluminum plates, the windowless facade looks stunning and helps protect the artwork inside from intense sunlight. It is one of many eye-catching museum buildings worldwide which attract interest both for their collections and for their creative design.

> International Museum Day was first held in 1977 to celebrate all museums, big and small. Today, many will host creative events linked to this year’s theme of sustainability and wellbeing.

<summary>Description</summary>

> California brown pelicans, cormorants, and gulls enjoy jostling for position on top of this stunning rock formation in Natural Bridges State Beach in Santa Cruz. It is the sole surviving natural 'bridge' in this state park. Once three bridges stood side-by-side here, carved by waves into cliffs that jutted out into the Pacific. This one stood in the middle, but the outermost bridge collapsed in 1905 and the innermost one disappeared in 1980.
> 
> The erosion of the waves is relentless, so eventually the final arch will collapse, and the birds will have to find another favorite perch. But there are plenty of other views on offer. The park is also a seasonal home to migratory monarch butterflies, which flutter through the air or cluster together in its eucalyptus grove. And if you're lucky, you might spot a migrating whale or see seals and otters playing offshore.

<summary>Description</summary>

> It's American Wetlands Month, a time to celebrate swamps, marshes, bogs, and other types of these important ecosystems. Wetlands play a vital role in storing carbon, improving water quality, and serving as habitat for many endangered plants and animals, including American crocodiles and whooping cranes. And yet, wetlands are threatened. Over the centuries, they have been drained to provide land for farming, industry, and housing. Pollution and invasive plants pose further threats. Since the late 1700s, more than half of the 221 million acres of wetlands that once existed in the 48 contiguous states have disappeared.
> 
> Georgia's Okefenokee Swamp, seen here, is a thriving wetland that is home to dozens of bird species, American alligators. and other critters. It is also the largest blackwater swamp in North America—the water appears almost black due to tannins from decaying vegetation. All looks calm in our homepage image, but the swamp gets its name from a Native American word that is often translated as 'trembling earth' or 'bubbling water.'

> Welcome to Fuerteventura, one of Spain's Canary Islands, found nearly 70 miles off the northwestern coast of Africa. For thousands of years, the volcanic islands have served as an international crossroads, attracting the interest of the Romans, Arab traders, and European navigators. Agriculture has long been important here, with bananas, tomatoes, and potatoes among the main crops. But while the first voyagers came in search of trade, today's visitors come to explore the many beautiful national parks and relax on beaches like the Playa del Matorral on Fuerteventura, seen here during a spectacular sunset.

> Is this newborn white-tailed deer wishing its mom a Happy Mother's Day? We hope so—it won't be long before it loses those spots and strikes out on its own. But for the first year or so of its life, it will rely on mom to feed it and keep it safe from predators. We honor mothers and maternal figures everywhere on the second Sunday in May. It was first celebrated in the US in 1908 and was made a national holiday six years later in 1914, thanks to campaign efforts by social activist Anna Jarvis. While Jarvis became known as the founder of Mother's Day in the US, she later complained that it had become too commercial and began to vocally oppose it. You don't need to spend a fortune to let mom know you love her. Like our homepage fawn, you can simply spend some quality time with her today, to show how much you appreciate your nearest and 'deer'-est.
