<summary>Description</summary>

> An imperial city in northern central Morocco, Meknes is steeped in history. Once the capital of Morocco under Sultan Ismail Ibn Sharif of the Alawi dynasty in the 17th century, it's known for its massive walls, grand gates, and structures built to last centuries. Meknes reflects the Moroccan style of architecture, with one of its most impressive landmarks being Heri es-Swani, seen in today's image.
> 
> Heri es-Swani was originally constructed as a stable and for storing vast amounts of grain to sustain the settlement and the sultan's armies. Its design was both practical and impressive—thick walls and an innovative cooling system helped maintain the food supply. Twenty-two rows of symmetrical arches divided the space into corridors that once had vaulted ceilings. Back then, mules climbed onto the roof terrace to deliver grain, which was dropped through specially designed holes to the floor below. The structure housed more than 12,000 horses. Today, it stands as an empty shell, acting as a scenic backdrop ready to be explored. This historical monument is a must-see for anyone curious about how empires were built and fed.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Ever heard of frozen bubbles? Abraham Lake in Alberta, Canada, has them during the winter, and they're not just beautiful—they're science in action. Created in 1972, Abraham Lake is a human-made reservoir that spans more than 20 square miles along the North Saskatchewan River. Thanks to glacier-fed waters from the Rocky Mountains, the lake stays transparent even in the coldest months. Glacial meltwater carries fine sediment that scatters sunlight, while natural filtration through rocks keeps pollutants to a minimum.
> 
> The snowy season attracts photographers and visitors from around the world who are eager to capture a rare sight at Preacher's Point: bubbles. These frozen globes form when microorganisms break down dead plants and animals on the lake bed, releasing methane. As the gas rises, it gets trapped by the ice, creating layers of bubbles in various sizes and shapes. It's wild to think that they're flammable and chilling under your feet. The ice is thickest in January and February and the bubbles clearly visible. If you're planning to check it out, just remember to stick close to the shoreline for your safety.

> New year, new goals—so why not start by taking a step toward better health? On this National Take the Stairs Day, let's climb into the past. The Great Wall of China, one of the longest humanmade structures in the world, offers the perfect inspiration. Stretching more than 13,000 miles and dating back thousands of years, the ancient marvel in today's picture is a series of fortifications spanning rugged mountains, valleys, and deserts. Featuring steep trenches and watchtowers, parts of it were designed to keep invaders at bay. Hiking the Great Wall offers a unique glimpse into this historical landmark. The experience varies from well-preserved sections like Mutianyu to wild, unrestored parts such as Jiankou. Some steps are so high, they're more like steps on a ladder! Talk about a workout—taking these stairs could rival any modern fitness challenge.
> 
> The Great Wall of China isn't just a wall, but a symbol of perseverance and strength. Similarly, taking the stairs instead of the elevator is a small but empowering step toward better health. Millions of people live with chronic conditions like asthma, and by choosing the stairs, you're not just building strength, but also improving your overall health. So, the next time you face an elevator, think of the Great Wall and take the stairs. Your future self will thank you!

<summary>Description</summary>

> Are you ready to rock the new year? Today is Old Rock Day, a day for celebrating and learning about old rocks and fossils. Rocks are common and few of us take the time to consider how amazing they are. But forged in volcanoes or molded by millennia of pressure, these solid masses of minerals hold the key to understanding how our planet formed. Rocks can also contain fossils, the remnants of long-extinct organisms, which give scientists clues about what creatures and plants have lived on Earth during its 4.5-billion-year history.
> 
> One of the world's most curious rock displays can be found on Koekohe Beach in New Zealand. The Moeraki Boulders, some of which are 7 feet in diameter, have been shaped by nature over millions of years. Each boulder started as a pebble on the seabed around 65 million years ago. Over time, layers of mud and silt built up around them, cemented together by calcite. Thanks to erosion and the movement of the sea, the boulders eventually emerged. Today, new boulders are still appearing, while the elements are slowly breaking down existing ones.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In the Italian province of Ravenna lies the Basilica of San Francesco, recognized for its beauty and historical significance. This Romanesque church, originally built in 450, features a sturdy square bell tower added in the 9th century, enhancing the basilica's exterior. Its design features three naves, divided by two rows of 12 columns each. Featured in today's image is the basilica's real showstopper: The basement crypt, or burial chamber, is a stunning model of early religious design. Complete with vaulted ceilings that slope down into rows of stone columns, its floor is a work of art itself. It's inlaid with beautifully intricate mosaic tiles that have withstood the test of time.
> 
> Built on soft marshland, Ravenna faces ongoing structural challenges because the entire city is gradually sinking. This is particularly evident in the crypt, which now remains perpetually submerged under about a foot of water. But instead of battling the slow flood, the basilica has embraced it, filling the pool with goldfish that glide between the ancient columns and above the submerged mosaics. Visitors often toss coins into the water, making the crypt more of a wishing well than a burial site.

> Look up at the skies and experience the magic of birds—it's National Bird Day. Birds come in many shapes and colors, but few are as striking as the plum-headed parakeet, seen in today's image. Native to the Indian subcontinent, these birds are known for their swift, acrobatic flight and distinctive calls that echo through the air. There have been reports of plum-headed parakeets making their way to places like New York, Florida, and even parts of the Middle East.
> 
> Today's event was set up to help draw attention to the problems that the bird trade causes. When kept in captivity, birds are deprived of their ability to fly and socialize, which can be distressing to these animals. This activity also has an impact on wild bird populations, with thousands of parrots captured from the wild and sold as pets every year. National Bird Day also encourages the adoption of rescued birds and promotes habitat conservation efforts for wild birds, urging people not to buy wild-caught parrots. On this day, half a million bird lovers engage in activities like birdwatching, studying bird species, and, importantly, adopting birds.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
