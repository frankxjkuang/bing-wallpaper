<summary>Description</summary>

> Italy's Dolomites don't just tower; they enchant, turning every trail into a story. Fondly known as the 'Pale Mountains,' the Dolomites derive their name from dolomite—a carbonate mineral. Set in the northern Italian Alps, the range spans over 345,000 acres and boasts 18 soaring peaks that rise above 9,500 feet. These mountains feature sheer cliffs, lofty walls, and a maze of narrow, winding valleys.
> 
> Amid the dramatic landscape of the Dolomites lies one of its most spectacular peaks, Seceda, featured in today's image. With a height of around 8,200 feet, it offers the highest panoramic viewpoint in Val Gardena, a scenic valley in the province of South Tyrol. A short cable car ride takes you to the summit, bypassing what would otherwise be a strenuous hike. Once at the top, you're greeted by a stunning sweep of the Dolomites' iconic jagged ridgelines. On a clear day, you might even spot Austria's tallest mountain, the Großglockner, located more than 90 miles away.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Graceful, powerful, and impossible to miss—the northern gannet is the largest seabird on the waters of the North Atlantic. It spends most of its time gliding over open seas and returning to land only to breed. These seabirds, known for their vast and noisy breeding colonies, called gannetries, nest on steep cliffs, remote rocky islands, and sea stacks that rise from the ocean.
> 
> Few birds hunt as dramatically as the northern gannet, which dives straight into the sea, as seen in today's image. Spotting prey from heights of up to 100 feet, the bird folds its wings and hits the water at speeds of over 60 mph. Its streamlined body, reinforced skull, and built-in shock absorbers, such as spongy bone plates and air sacs beneath the skin, make these high-impact dives both powerful and safe. Once underwater, the gannet uses its wings and webbed feet to swim after fish, diving as deep as 70 feet and staying submerged for up to 30 seconds. Its forward-facing eyes provide excellent depth perception, while hidden nostrils prevent water from rushing in during those lightning-fast descents.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes, located near Stovepipe Wells Village in Death Valley National Park, are the most accessible and iconic dunes in the park. They are formed by a combination of eroding mountains to the north that supply sand, prevailing winds that move it, and surrounding mountains that trap it from the south—creating a stunning landscape of rippling sand hills. Named after the resilient mesquite trees that grow here, the dunes offer breathtaking views at sunrise and sunset, as well as exceptional stargazing opportunities.
> 
> Death Valley National Park, spanning more than 3.4 million acres, is the largest national park in the contiguous United States. It is known for its extreme temperatures, vast desert landscapes, and geological diversity. More than 93% of the park is designated wilderness, offering opportunities for backcountry exploration, though visitors must be cautious of hazards like extreme heat, flash floods, and wildlife. Despite its harsh environment, the park is rich in natural beauty and cultural history, including its deep ties to the Timbisha Shoshone people, who have lived in the region for generations.

> Every year on July 4, Americans come together to celebrate the birth of our nation. It marks the day in 1776 when the Declaration of Independence was adopted, proclaiming the original 13 colonies' freedom from British rule. From coast to coast, we celebrate with fireworks, BBQs, parades, and patriotic music—and Seattle hosts one of the most dazzling displays in the country.
> 
> Set against the backdrop of Lake Union, Seattle's fireworks light up the night sky, reflecting the city's vibrant mix of history, diversity, and innovation. The most populous city in the Pacific Northwest, Seattle has deep roots—from its Indigenous heritage to its role as the birthplace of grunge to its importance as a technology center. This Fourth of July, whether you're watching with the crowds at Gas Works Park or friends on a rooftop deck, take a moment to reflect on our shared past—and the freedom to honor it together.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Nestled in the northern Gulf Coast of Florida, is Rainbow Springs State Park. This area has served as a natural resource for humans and animals for centuries, with the Rainbow River—flowing through the park—playing a major role. The gently winding waterway is fed by Rainbow Springs, one of Florida's largest springs. The water that bubbles up here comes from a 770-square-mile area and eventually flows into the Withlacoochee River.
> 
> The Rainbow River's transparent waters are perfect for swimming and snorkeling, and they maintain a constant temperature of 72°F year-round. The park's history dates to the late 1880s, when hard rock phosphate was discovered in the area, leading to a boomtown era. This period saw the rapid growth of a small community called Juliette near the springs, driven by the phosphate mining industry. During the 1960s, the park emerged as a popular tourist destination, featuring glass-bottom boat rides, a monorail system, and even a rodeo. Today, visitors can explore the ornamental gardens, waterfalls, and walking paths, and enjoy the diverse wildlife that calls Rainbow Springs home.

<summary>Description</summary>

> That bright fish hiding in the anemone? That's the spine-cheeked anemonefish, or the maroon clownfish, and it is not just a cute creature. Native to the Indo-Pacific, from western Indonesia to Taiwan and the Great Barrier Reef, this species lives on the edges of coral reefs. It is easily distinguished by the spine extending from each cheek—hence the name. Groups of spine-cheeked anemonefish form around a single dominant female, and if she disappears, the top male steps up—literally changing sex to take her place. Spine-cheeked anemonefish thrive in warm, shallow waters and stick close to their chosen sea anemone.
> 
> The closest marine companion of a spine-cheeked anemonefish is the bubble-tip anemone, as seen in the image. These anemones don't all look alike—their appearances often vary with age, depth, and whether they host anemonefish. This species offers the perfect mix of cover and protection. In return, the fish defend the anemone from threats and remove debris from its surface. It's a stable, symbiotic bond that benefits both partners and keeps them closely tied to the same patch of reef.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
