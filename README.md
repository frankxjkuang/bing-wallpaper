> Get ready to revel—Mardi Gras is here! Also called Fat Tuesday or Shrove Tuesday, the holiday was originally celebrated to live life to the fullest before fasting and giving up other indulgences for Lent. For some, it's just an excuse to party.
> 
> Fat Tuesday celebrations take place around the world, particularly in areas with strong French influences. New Orleans is particularly linked with the festival and hosts a massive celebration that can last up to eight weeks, depending on when Easter falls. Mardi Gras parades are held from the official start of Mardi Gras on King's Day, January 6. Social clubs, known as krewes, hold parades on assigned schedules and routes. Crowds gather along the way, hoping to catch coins, cups, and beads thrown by float riders, a tradition that started in the 1880s. Ready to make merry and join the parade?

> When British naturalist Charles Darwin arrived in the Galápagos Islands in 1835, he was already four years into a round-the-world voyage aboard the survey ship HMS Beagle. His observations on the remote volcanic islands in the eastern Pacific Ocean would help him to develop his famous theory of evolution through natural selection. While studying the creatures here, he concluded that many South American species, mainly reptiles and birds that could cross the vast expanse of water, had migrated to the Galápagos and gradually adapted to their surroundings.
> 
> Among animals Darwin encountered were Galápagos giant tortoises, like those featured on our homepage. They grow up to 5 feet in length but have different shaped shells, depending on which island they inhabit. The islands are named after these magnificent creatures, 'galápago' meaning freshwater tortoise in Spanish. Today, on International Darwin Day, let's celebrate these gentle giants, which contributed to one of the great scientific discoveries of the 19th century.

> Welcome to Folegandros, one of the Greek Cyclades Islands in the Aegean Sea. This picturesque island has changed hands several times during its long history. It is thought it was once home to the Dorians, one of the four major ethnic groups of classical Greece, but it was also ruled for centuries by the Republic of Venice and later the Ottoman Empire. Greece reclaimed it in 1828.
> 
> Chora, the island's modern capital, can be seen on our homepage, perched on the edge of a 656-foot cliff with sweeping views of the ocean and surrounding islands. Built by the Venetians in 1212, the town is now a popular tourist destination, with its charming squares and traditional whitewashed churches.

> Celebrating the first new moon of the lunar calendar, an estimated 2 billion people gather worldwide to usher in the Lunar New Year with vibrant celebrations and family reunions. The festivities, also known as the Spring Festival or Chinese New Year, last for 15 days, ending with the Lantern Festival. From envelopes to lanterns, red is the dominant color, symbolizing luck and prosperity. Streets come alive with the rhythm of drums as the dragon dance takes center stage. Our homepage today shows a bird's-eye view of the dragons—elongated puppets with shimmering scales, animated by a team of dancers. Lunar New Year is a popular time for families to reunite and is said to be responsible for the world's largest annual human migration. Each year is linked to one of the 12 zodiac animals and 2024 heralds the Year of the Dragon, a symbol of nobility, power, and success.

> An unspoiled landscape carved by nature's raw power, waves crash against Pegadung Rock on the southern coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra. This remote beach boasts turquoise waters, but it is the striking rocks that steal the show, standing tall against the might of the Indian Ocean. The rock formations, some of which are 33 feet tall, have given rise to various nicknames, among them Gigi Hiu (shark teeth) and Batu Layar (rock screen) Beach. While this beach has no tourist accommodation, the nearby village of Kiluan presents a haven for visitors. For those ready to trade lounging for exploring, this Sumatran treasure awaits.

At nearly 11,250 feet high, this dormant stratovolcano is the tallest mountain in the state, drawing adventurers and nature aficionados alike. With 12 named glaciers and numerous snow fields, Mount Hood offers a wintry playground all year round. It also nurtures ancient forests and provides a haven for wildlife, including cougars and wolves. Over the past 1,800 years, the volcano has erupted three times. While considered dormant, there is still a chance that it could erupt one day.
