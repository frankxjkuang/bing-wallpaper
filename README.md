> As we celebrate Black History Month, we're taking a moment to highlight an institution in the world of dance—the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater in New York City. Founded by the visionary choreographer Alvin Ailey in 1958, it fuses elements of modern dance, ballet, jazz, and theater. The company's performances demonstrate the importance of artistic expression in preserving and celebrating Black culture in America.

> For the next four days, birdwatchers all over the world will be taking part in the Great Backyard Bird Count. Bird lovers will identify the feathered friends they see or hear in their area and report their findings. The data helps scientists protect birds by providing information about how populations and habitats change over time.

> In today's image is a pyrrhuloxia—or desert cardinal—a songbird that lives in the deserts of northern Mexico and the American Southwest. Locals might be lucky enough to see one of these red and gray birds; they often visit backyards in search of seeds, or to eat the fruit from shrubs and cacti.

> All eyes are on hippos today! The world's third-largest land mammals after elephants and white rhinos, hippopotamuses are found in rivers and lakes throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Despite their size—they can weigh up to 4 tons—they are vulnerable to various threats, including habitat loss.
> 
> The peeping calf in today's image is still under the watchful eye of its mother and will continue to be so until nursing ends at about 8 months. These chubby mammals might seem cute, but their strong jaws, large teeth, and aggressive behavior make them one of the world's most dangerous wild animals. So, admire them from a safe distance—despite their short legs, they are also fast runners!

> Love is in the air as Valentine's Day arrives! These red-crowned cranes, seen in the reed marshes and frozen lakes of Hokkaido Island, Japan, know how to turn on the charm. The graceful birds call in unison and bow to each other as part of their captivating mating dance. Once a mate is chosen, the pair develop a lifelong bond, a trait that has helped make them a symbol of longevity, fidelity, and good fortune in Japanese culture. These gentle creatures were also the inspiration for the traditional origami crane. According to legend, folding a thousand cranes can grant wishes.

> Get ready to revel—Mardi Gras is here! Also called Fat Tuesday or Shrove Tuesday, the holiday was originally celebrated to live life to the fullest before fasting and giving up other indulgences for Lent. For some, it's just an excuse to party.
> 
> Fat Tuesday celebrations take place around the world, particularly in areas with strong French influences. New Orleans is particularly linked with the festival and hosts a massive celebration that can last up to eight weeks, depending on when Easter falls. Mardi Gras parades are held from the official start of Mardi Gras on King's Day, January 6. Social clubs, known as krewes, hold parades on assigned schedules and routes. Crowds gather along the way, hoping to catch coins, cups, and beads thrown by float riders, a tradition that started in the 1880s. Ready to make merry and join the parade?

<summary>Description</summary>

> When British naturalist Charles Darwin arrived in the Galápagos Islands in 1835, he was already four years into a round-the-world voyage aboard the survey ship HMS Beagle. His observations on the remote volcanic islands in the eastern Pacific Ocean would help him to develop his famous theory of evolution through natural selection. While studying the creatures here, he concluded that many South American species, mainly reptiles and birds that could cross the vast expanse of water, had migrated to the Galápagos and gradually adapted to their surroundings.
> 
> Among animals Darwin encountered were Galápagos giant tortoises, like those featured on our homepage. They grow up to 5 feet in length but have different shaped shells, depending on which island they inhabit. The islands are named after these magnificent creatures, 'galápago' meaning freshwater tortoise in Spanish. Today, on International Darwin Day, let's celebrate these gentle giants, which contributed to one of the great scientific discoveries of the 19th century.

> Welcome to Folegandros, one of the Greek Cyclades Islands in the Aegean Sea. This picturesque island has changed hands several times during its long history. It is thought it was once home to the Dorians, one of the four major ethnic groups of classical Greece, but it was also ruled for centuries by the Republic of Venice and later the Ottoman Empire. Greece reclaimed it in 1828.

> Chora, the island's modern capital, can be seen on our homepage, perched on the edge of a 656-foot cliff with sweeping views of the ocean and surrounding islands. Built by the Venetians in 1212, the town is now a popular tourist destination, with its charming squares and traditional whitewashed churches.
