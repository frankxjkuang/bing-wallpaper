<summary>Description</summary>

> The short-eared owl, featured in today's image, is a grassland-dwelling member of the owl family. Found on all continents except Antarctica and Australia, it's one of the most widely distributed bird species. This raptor belongs to the genus Asio, whose members are characterized by feather tufts ('ears') on their head. The short-eared owl only reveals its tufts when feeling defensive.
> 
> Irregular wingbeats cause its flight to be on the floppy side, like a moth or bat. It likes to glide a few feet above the ground in open fields and grasslands, swooping down feet first to grab its prey. Owls primarily hunt at night, but this silent hunter is also active during the day and at dusk. Its daylight hunts often line up with the peak activity of small rodents called voles—its favorite meal. Known to relocate to areas with higher rodent populations, the short-eared owl even wanders nomadically in search of better food supplies during years when vole populations are low.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Carved by the Colorado River, nearly 2 billion years of Earth's history are exposed in the layers of the Grand Canyon. While geologists continue to debate parts of the formation story of the canyon, recent studies suggest the river carved its path through the region about 5 to 6 million years ago. Since then, the river has been deepening and widening the canyon while sculpting its dramatic geographic features.
> 
> Today, the Grand Canyon is much more than just a massive chasm with exceptional vistas. It's home to some stunning geographic features, like Zoroaster Temple, featured in today's image. This towering 7,123-foot summit is in Coconino County, Arizona. The peak was named after the ancient Iranian prophet Zoroaster by George Wharton James, an American photographer and journalist, and Clarence Dutton, an American geologist. Rick Tidrick and Dave Ganci made the first summit ascent of Zoroaster Temple in September 1958. This triumph marked the Grand Canyon's first technical climb, turning it into a hotspot and igniting a wave of summit-chasing climbers.

> Beech trees are pretty amazing. There are several species worldwide, but the European beech steals the spotlight in much of Europe. With its smooth gray bark, short trunk, and sweeping branches, this tree is a standout in Belgium's forests, as shown in today's image. It grows in temperate regions and prefers well-drained, fertile soils, taking up to 30 years to mature. Not only do these 160-foot-tall trees dominate the landscape, but their wood is also used to make some of the sturdiest furniture, flooring, and even kitchen tools.
> 
> Wildlife such as black bears, foxes, squirrels, chipmunks, and mice love them too—beech nuts, though slightly bitter, provide a feast for all kinds of critters. In winter, the beech forests in Belgium become even more enchanting. The trees' big, sprawling branches go bare, and whole forests transform into quiet, frosty wonderlands—perfect for a peaceful stroll or simply soaking up some fresh air.

> Today's image takes us to a city that is bold, unpolished in the best way, and brimming with personality. While it's famous for its port wine (cheers to that!), there's so much more to discover in the Portuguese city of Porto. As you walk through its streets, you'll notice façades adorned with azulejos—painted tin-glazed ceramic tilework found in Portugal and Spain—historic churches like São Francisco, and the iconic Dom Luís I Bridge spanning the Douro River, which runs through the city.
> 
> Porto's roots go back to Roman times, and its role as a key trading hub has greatly influenced its modern identity. Culture runs deep here, from the soulful sounds of fado music to the lively markets and annual festivals like Festa de São João do Porto. Street art surprises you at every turn, and quirky bookstores and cafes make exploring a delight. Food lovers can indulge in the famous francesinha, a hearty sandwich, or enjoy fresh seafood paired with a glass of local wine.

> What could be better than warming up winter with a feast that's a little wild and a lot of fun? Thorrablot, Iceland's midwinter festival, invites you to dive headfirst into tradition. This celebration of survival, culture, and community, which dates to the Viking Age, was once a way for Icelanders to honor Thor, the Norse god of thunder. Today, people celebrate by gathering to feast on an array of local delicacies, including fermented shark, smoked lamb, rye bread, and shots of Brennivín—often called 'black death' schnapps.
> 
> Strokkur geyser—featured in the image—warms up winter in a completely different way. Located in the geothermal area beside the Hvítá River, this geyser erupts every 6 to 10 minutes, shooting hot water 49 to 66 feet into the air. It has been consistently active since 1963. There is science behind its eruption—magma beneath the Earth's crust heats groundwater until the pressure builds up, forcing the water explosively to the surface. Both Thorrablot and Strokkur celebrate Iceland's resilience—one through its people and the other through its land.

> Carved into rose-red cliffs, Petra and its crown jewel, Ad-Deir, or 'The Monastery,' feel like stepping into a real-life Indiana Jones adventure. Tucked in the heart of Jordan's arid desert landscapes, this ancient city once thrived as the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom in the 2nd century BCE. It was also a hub of the spice trade, connecting distant regions like China, Egypt, Greece, and India. The city was abandoned for around 500 years before being rediscovered in 1812, earning it the 'Lost City' moniker.
> 
> Ad-Deir, seen in today's image, dates to the 1st century CE. Its design is characterized by a combination of Hellenistic and Mesopotamian influences. Although the exact purpose of the structure is debated, it's believed to have been used as a church during the Byzantine period. Standing nearly 150 feet tall and 160 feet wide, its massive facade is carved directly into the sandstone cliffs, showcasing the Nabataeans' ingenious craftsmanship and architecture. The journey to this landmark involves a steep hike up 800 stone steps, winding through rocky terrain. At the top, you're rewarded with panoramic views of the rugged Petra valley that make the climb more than worth it.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
