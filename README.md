<summary>Description</summary>

> Ready for a coastal adventure? Welcome to Tasman National Park in Tasmania, an island state of Australia about 150 miles off its southeastern coast. Spanning more than 41 square miles, this park features dramatic cliffs and distinctive columns of dolerite rock. Tasmans Arch, seen in today's image, is a standout example. Shaped over time by the Tasman Sea, it was once the roof of a massive sea cave. The sea's pressure, combined with air, sand, and stones, slowly pried open the vertical cracks in the cliff, dislodging chunks of rock. The cave kept growing, deepening, and lengthening, until it eventually gave way, leaving behind this towering natural bridge. Tasmans Arch is named after the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman, who also lends his name to the state of Tasmania.

<summary>Description</summary>

> With waves crashing against its sturdy base and a stormy sea swirling around, this lighthouse in Porthcawl, on the south coast of Wales, has been standing resilient since 1860. At 30 feet tall, Porthcawl Lighthouse, designed by the eminent engineer James Walker, is often pictured being battered by waves when storms hit. The town's rugged coastline, with its hidden rocky coves, has always posed a perilous challenge to sailors. Porthcawl Lighthouse was built to help guide the increasing maritime traffic along the Bristol Channel. This cast-iron lighthouse was the last one in the UK to be powered by coal and gas. Although it was converted to electric power in 1997, the lighthouse still maintains its historical charm.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Striking appearance, strong presence, and impressive antlers—meet the red deer, photographed in the ancient forests of Glen Affric, one of Scotland's most beautiful valleys. Found across Europe, Asia, and parts of North Africa, this species is Britain's largest land mammal and an integral part of the Caledonian pinewoods, Scotland's coniferous forests. From featuring in cave art found throughout Europe to medieval hunting traditions, red deer have always held a special place in the human imagination. In many parts of the world, their image is synonymous with the wild, free spirit of nature. Glen Affric, with its lochs, moorlands, and mountains, provides the perfect habitat for these magnificent creatures. This national nature reserve is also popular with hikers, climbers, and nature enthusiasts.
> 
> The Scottish red deer is a subspecies that is slightly smaller than its counterparts in continental Europe. This species exhibits insular dwarfism, a process where large animals evolve to have smaller bodies over many generations.

<summary>Description</summary>

> If you've ever dreamed of walking on water, or something close to it, the Wadden Sea is the place for you. Tracing over 300 miles along the coast of the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark, this UNESCO World Heritage Site offers a unique landscape of tidal flats and wetlands. In fact, it is the world's largest unbroken intertidal zone—underwater at high tide and exposed at low tide—of sand and mud flats. The area is also a playground for aquatic species such as houting fish, brown trout, and white-beaked dolphins, and is home to birds like waders and herons.
> 
> Pictured here is the Wadden Sea coast in Friesland, Netherlands. This coast is dotted with charming fishing villages and medieval churches. Mudflat hiking is a recreational pastime here—the Dutch call it wadlopen. As the tide recedes, mud-trampers can walk across the seabed, squishing through the mud and wading through shallow waters. Whether you're up for a wadlopen challenge or a seal-spotting safari, there's plenty of adventure to be found here. Just don't forget your boots—things are bound to get a little messy!

<summary>Description</summary>

> As twilight descends today, Chiang Mai, Thailand's second-largest city, will come alive with thousands of glowing lanterns for Yi Peng. Held on the full moon of the second month of the Lanna lunar calendar, this celebration is about letting go of negativity and embracing new beginnings. The highlight of the festival is the release of 'khom loi' or 'khom loy'—floating paper lanterns—into the night sky, which becomes a sea of warm, golden lights. People often write their hopes and dreams on the lanterns. They gather around temples and palaces to send their wishes skyward, hoping for good fortune in the year to come.
> 
> In addition to the lantern release, the city hosts vibrant parades, traditional dance performances, and stunning decorations. Yi Peng coincides with Loy Krathong, another festival where small, intricately crafted baskets, decorated with banana leaves, incense, and candles, are floated down rivers. Together, these festivals create a spectacle that draws visitors from across the world to witness the illumination of Chiang Mai.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Known for its rows of pastel houses that stretch down to the Mediterranean Sea, Manarola, seen in today's image, is a picturesque village on the Italian Riviera. Perched on the rugged cliffs of the Ligurian coast, it's one of the five villages that make up Cinque Terre National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The name 'Manarola' might have evolved from the Latin 'Magna rota,' which means 'large wheel,' a nod to the village's historical mill wheel.
> 
> Believed to be the oldest village in the Cinque Terre, dating to 1338, Manarola's history is rooted in fishing and winemaking. Sciacchetrà, a dessert wine unique to this area, has long been immortalized in the verses of Italian poets. Take a walk along the Via dell'Amore, or 'Path of Love'—a scenic coastal trail connecting Manarola to its neighboring village, Riomaggiore—and you can sense the romance and charm that defines this region. Legend has it that the footpath became a meeting place for lovers from the two villages. Time slows down when you're in Manarola, and the magic of the country's coastal heritage comes to life.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Take a stroll along almost any marina from Costa Rica to Alaska, and you'll likely hear the playful barks of sea lions echo through the air. California sea lions, like the one pictured, are a common sight basking in the sun along the rocky shores of North America's western coast. These marine mammals, belonging to the pinniped group, are often mistaken for seals. An easy way to distinguish between them is by looking at their ears—sea lions have visible flaps, seals don't.
> 
> Sea lions also have a special relationship with giant kelp, seen in today's image from Baja California, Mexico. These towering underwater plants, which can grow up to 175 feet in ideal conditions, sway gently with the currents, creating beautiful scenery. Kelp forests are home to a diverse array of marine life, including sea lions, tiny invertebrates like snails, prawns, and jellyfish, and a wide range of fish, like cod, rockfish, and wrasse. Sea lions twist and turn through the thick kelp strands, hunting fish hiding within the leaves. They also use kelp as refuge from predators like sharks, blending in with the fronds of the brown algae to avoid detection. Kelp's rapid growth makes it an ideal habitat for marine life of all types to thrive.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
