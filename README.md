<summary>Description</summary>

> The island of Sardinia in Italy, with its rugged cliffs, secret beaches, and endless shades of blue, is undeniably a Mediterranean treasure. On the island's eastern coast lies Cala Luna, featured here—a beach in the Gulf of Orosei. Rising at the mouth of Rio Illune, this beach is at the end of the Codula di Luna canyon. It is a haven of golden sand, surrounded by white cliffs that rise more than 950 feet into the sky—perfect for rock climbing.
> 
> Here, the waters are shallow at first, before deepening into clear depths ideal for snorkeling, diving, and fishing. In the local Nuoro dialect, the word for 'luna,' Italian for 'moon', is rendered as 'elune,' a name that perfectly captures the essence of the beach's crescent shape.

> If there's one place that brings the cycling spirit to life, it's the Netherlands. For World Bicycle Day, today's image captures bicycles lined up on a bridge in the Dutch city of Utrecht. More than half the journeys around the city happen on bikes, surpassing cars and other modes of travel. Nearly everyone lives within 15 minutes of essentials—and over 90% of residents can reach key places in just 10 minutes. This wasn't always the case. It was only in the 1970s, sparked by an oil crisis, rising car-related issues, and strong social movements, that the Netherlands started prioritizing bikes over cars. Since then, cities have embraced bike-friendly streets, dedicated lanes, and traffic lights for cyclists. And thanks to the famously flat landscape, cycling here feels as natural as walking.

> This year, the first week of June marks National Garden Week—a time to celebrate the joy of gardening and the beauty it brings to our lives. Gardening not only connects us to nature but also boosts our mental health and physical well-being. Just spending time outdoors provides Vitamin D from the sun, which helps our bones stay strong and supports a healthy immune system.
> 
> Pictured here is a skipper butterfly taking a break from its quick, darting flight on a coneflower in New York's Rockefeller State Park Preserve. Native to North America, coneflowers and other members of the Echinacea genus are loved by both gardeners and pollinators for their hardy blooms and spiky centers. Whether you plant a few flowers or create a whole garden, this week is a perfect opportunity to get your hands in the dirt and enjoy the simple pleasures of nature.

> 'Life under the sea is better than anything they got up there,' Sebastian the crab once told Ariel. But are we doing enough to protect that underwater world? On June 1, we celebrate World Reef Awareness Day, a time to recognize the beauty—and fragility—of coral reef ecosystems. One magnificent example is the New Caledonian barrier reef, which wraps around Grande Terre, New Caledonia's largest island. At over 930 miles long, it's one of the longest continuous barrier reefs in the world. Its vast 9,300-square-mile lagoon is home to over 2,300 fish species, endangered dugongs, green sea turtles, and migrating humpback whales.
> 
> Reefs like this face growing threats—from pollution, mining runoff, rising ocean temperatures, and even harmful chemicals in some sunscreens. Increased tourism can also strain these fragile ecosystems. This World Reef Awareness Day, commit to reef-friendly choices: use reef-safe sunscreen, reduce plastic waste, and support conservation efforts in your community or online.

> Discover Knuthöjdsmossen, a nature reserve that covers almost 250 acres near the city of Hällefors, Sweden. This tranquil haven features a boardwalk that meanders through a bog, showcasing several small lakes, sand dunes, marshes, and pines.
> 
> The landscape is shaped by the last inland ice that melted around 10,000 years ago, leaving behind moraine and glacial river sand. The reserve's largest sand dune is the 33-foot-tall Stora Hälleforsdynen. The sand dunes are home to many unique insects. A particularly rare gray ant, Formica cinerea, is present in this area. Birdwatchers will be delighted by the diverse avian population, including the red-throated diver, northern lapwing, green sandpiper, and common goldeneye.

<summary>Description</summary>

> You'll hear it before you see it. The steady ripple, the splash of trout, the distant laughter of hikers. That's the Little Pigeon River, threading its way through Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee. Long before tourists tubed it and fly fishers angled in it, this river was how people stayed afloat. The Cherokee tribe fished in it. Settlers built grist mills along it. Towns like Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge grew up next to it. Even the river's name is a nod to the past—the passenger pigeon, once common in the area, vanished by the early 1900s.
> 
> The West, Middle, and East Prongs of the Little Pigeon come together to form a system that cuts through the Smokies and flows into the Pigeon River. Trails like the Gatlinburg Trail run alongside the river, offering flat paths with water views and shady rest spots. Some hikes, like the Ramsey Cascades trail, follow the river deeper into the park and reward you with impressive waterfalls. Black bears, salamanders, kingfishers, and the occasional river otter treat the Little Pigeon like their favorite watering hole. So, next time you're in the Smokies, don't just look up at the peaks, listen to the water below.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Some towns live in the present. Miravet in Spain politely declined. Clinging to a cliff above the River Ebro, this Catalan village offers a living glimpse into the Middle Ages. A castle keeps its perch, potters spin like it's the 1300s, and the local ferry still refuses to join the motor age. Welcome to the village where even the river seems too relaxed to rush. As Spain's longest river, the Ebro winds through tales of Iberians, Romans, Moors, and Knights Templar. Locals once relied on its waters for trade, transport, and even defense. Today, you'll spot kayakers, ferry boats, and visitors drifting through the same currents where Crusaders once crossed.
> 
> Perched above the village, the Miravet Castle dates to the 12th century. Built by the Moors and later fortified by the French military order Knights Templar, this fortress was made to last. Thick walls, strategic towers, and a commanding view of the river made sure of that. With a population of less than 700, the village is a quiet maze of stone houses and narrow lanes, built to confuse invaders and, coincidentally, modern tourists. There's a former Jewish quarter, viewpoints that deliver postcard-worthy angles, and plenty of silence—broken only by birds, bells, and the occasional clay jug clinking into place.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
