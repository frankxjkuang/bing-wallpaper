<summary>Description</summary>

> This stunning view—where the sky meets the open waters of the Atlantic—is accessible only by foot. Tucked away on Ireland's wild and beautiful Dingle Peninsula, Dunquin Pier is one of the most photogenic spots in County Kerry. The small pier is famous for its winding, serpentine path that zigzags dramatically down the cliffside like a ribbon. These steep curves aren't just for the thrill—they're the only way to reach the pier below, where boats depart for the remote Blasket Islands.
> 
> The nearby village of Dunquin (Dún Chaoin in Irish) is Ireland's westernmost settlement, offering sweeping views and a deep connection to Irish heritage. With a population of just over 100, Dunquin is known for its strong Gaelic traditions, storytelling, and ties to the Blasket Island writers. Visitors often stop at the Blasket Centre, a cultural museum that tells the story of island life and emigration. Whether you're drawn by the dramatic landscape or the rich cultural heritage, Dunquin offers a uniquely Irish experience that feels both timeless and unforgettable.

> He may be young, but these antlers speak of future battles. In Denali National Park, Alaska, a young bull moose lifts his head above the shrubs. At this stage, his antlers are more crown than weapon—still covered in velvet. But even now, they hint at a life shaped by instinct, sparring, and the quiet pull of dominance.
> 
> Moose are the largest members of the deer family in North America, and mature bulls can top 1,500 pounds and reach nearly 7 feet at the shoulder. Their antlers grow at an astonishing pace—up to an inch a day in summer—only to be shed every winter, then regrown each spring. This young bull might not be ready to duel for territory or mates just yet, but rehearsal has already begun. He'll spar gently with others, learning how to move, how to hold his ground, how to rise in the ranks of the wild. Spotting moose in Denali is fairly common, but finding one mid-growth is something else entirely: a glimpse into the making of a giant. For now, there's no clash—just the quiet power of potential beneath Alaska's endless sky.

> What do invisible gases, vintage hairspray, and satellites have in common? They all played a role in one of the greatest environmental comebacks in history. Seen from 225 miles above, the Gulf Coast glows like a constellation—clusters of light scattered across the dark. But what truly makes this view possible can't be seen: the ozone layer, silently shielding everything below from the sun's ultraviolet rays. By the 1980s, that shield was thinning fast—damaged by chemicals once used in refrigeration and aerosol products. The solution? A global pact. The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, led to a swift phase-out of ozone-depleting substances. Today, satellites show that the hole over Antarctica is shrinking. Scientists believe it could be fully healed by mid-century.
> 
> On September 16, we mark the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer—a celebration of science, global cooperation, and collective will. It's a reminder that no molecule is too small to have a massive impact. But it's proof, too, that with the right action, even invisible damage can be undone.

> What's as colorful as the diversity and history of humankind? The Latino Cultural Center in Dallas, Texas. Its vibrant walls—seen in today's image—rise from a 27,000-square-foot foundation and celebrate Latino and Hispanic arts and culture. From September 15 to October 15, our country observes Hispanic Heritage Month, honoring the histories, cultures, and contributions of Americans with roots in Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central and South America.
> 
> One of the most dynamic places to experience this celebration is the Latino Cultural Center. Designed by renowned Mexican architect Ricardo Legorreta, the center is a bold landmark that blends modern design with traditional Mexican aesthetics. Since its opening in 2003, the venue has hosted over 300 events annually, including art exhibitions, theater performances, and community workshops. During Hispanic Heritage Month, it becomes a lively hub, showcasing local Latino artists, folkloric dance, and cultural storytelling. Notable exhibitions have featured artists including Celia Álvarez Muñoz, Judy Baca, Margaret Garcia, and Benito Huerta. Whether you're attending a performance or admiring its architecture, the Latino Cultural Center stands as a powerful tribute to the enduring influence of Hispanic culture in American life.

> Olympic National Park covers a rare mix of terrain—and that's part of its unique appeal. Alpine ridges, quiet forests, and one of the longest stretches of undeveloped coastline in the lower 48 all meet here. Spanning nearly 1,400 square miles in Washington State, this UNESCO World Heritage Site drew over 3.7 million visitors in 2024. Originally protected in 1909 as Mount Olympus National Monument by President Theodore Roosevelt, the area became a national park in 1938.
> 
> Rain isn't a problem here—it's the reason this moss-draped area exists. On the western edge of the park, the Hoh Rainforest receives about 140 inches of rain a year—over 11 feet—and it wears every drop proudly. Towering Sitka spruces, western red cedars, and coast Douglas firs line trails like the Hall of Mosses, while banana slugs, bobcats, and Olympic black bears call the forest home. The Hoh is one of the best-preserved temperate rainforests in the world. And if you're chasing waterfalls, Sol Duc Falls delivers—three streams plunging into a narrow, mossy gorge. Olympic is a solid reminder that the best hikes don't always come with clear skies.

> It's not polished or curated—and that's exactly the point. Drive just over an hour north of San Francisco, and you'll reach Point Reyes National Seashore—a place where fog drifts slowly, tule elk roam freely, and time seems to pause. Established by Congress on this day in 1962, the park was set aside to protect this piece of coastline for public enjoyment and environmental conservation. It covers over 100 square miles and features an impressive array of landscapes, from coastal prairie and blustery headlands to sandy shores and Douglas fir woodlands.
> 
> At the park's eastern boundary, Chimney Rock—seen in today's image—extends into the Pacific Ocean with towering cliffs and sweeping sea views. Its trail is considered one of the best spots on the West Coast to witness the gray whale migration. In the winter months, nearby secluded beaches become a refuge for northern elephant seals, offering an opportunity for wildlife viewing. With over 490 species of birds, more than 80 types of mammals, and numerous rare plants, Point Reyes ranks among the most ecologically diverse places in the country. Over 150 miles of trails invite visitors to slow their pace and immerse themselves in the surroundings.

> With lifelong bonds, signature whistles, and echolocation, dolphins are more than just smart swimmers. First observed in 2022, World Dolphin Day shines a light on these intelligent marine mammals and the oceans they rely on. The day encourages people to learn about their behavior and the threats they face. Over 40 dolphin species swim our seas, from the Māui dolphin to the Irrawaddy dolphin. They're expert navigators, problem-solvers, and team players. Some even form superpods—temporary gatherings of hundreds or thousands of dolphins moving together offshore.
> 
> Off the coast of Marsa Alam in Egypt, pods of spinner dolphins glide through the warm waters of the Red Sea—as seen in today's image. True to their name, they can leap and spin in the air up to seven times in a single jump. Found in tropical waters across the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans, they rest during the day in calm bays and hunt offshore at night. But their predictable routines have left them vulnerable to unregulated tourism. Some conservation zones now limit visitor access to allow dolphins to rest undisturbed. The hope? That these creatures continue their spins without interruption.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
