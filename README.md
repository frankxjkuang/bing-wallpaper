<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Procida is a charming Italian island in the Gulf of Naples, boasting colorful buildings, picturesque streets, and stunning sea views. The island has a rich history, having been settled by the Greeks, Romans, and other civilizations over the centuries, but is less well-known than its larger neighbours, Capri and Ischia. Its oldest fishing village, Marina Corricella, features pastel-colored buildings and narrow streets and is a great place to enjoy fresh seafood and soak up the atmosphere. From there, you can climb up to the fortified medieval village of Terra Murata, built on the island's highest point, which offers panoramic views over the entire Gulf of Naples.
> 
> Procida is home to several beautiful beaches and coves, including Chiaiolella, Spiaggia del Postino, and Ciraccio. And it's popular with film makers too, starring in more than 30 movies including 'The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,' 'The Talented Mr. Ripley,' and 'Il Postino.' In 2022, it was named Italy's Capital of Culture, the first island to be awarded the honor.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Yes, the water here is as inviting as it looks: clear as glass, the shade of a precious gem, and a perfect 73 degrees every day of the year. Set within a subtropical forest, Juniper Springs is one of Florida's oldest and best-known recreation areas, established in the 1930s as a place to camp, hike, and swim. Long before Disney arrived, natural springs like this one were the big draw in the Sunshine State.
> 
> Florida is home to the largest concentration of freshwater springs in the world, with more than 1,000 popping up where the massive Floridan aquifer breaks through the surface. This underground reservoir hides beneath the entire state, providing Florida with almost all of its drinking water.
> 
> Overextraction and pollution from fertilizers and septic systems have put some springs in peril but in Juniper Springs, these jewel-toned waters are protected by the Ocala National Forest, so it's likely to look like this for a long time.

Found only on the island of Taiwan, they constantly chatter while feeding and sometimes hang upside-down on cherry trees like bats.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Located high in the Andes Mountains, Peru's Machu Picchu is believed to have been an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti, who ruled in the mid-15th century. This 'Lost City of the Incas' is one of the world's most famous archaeological sites, an engineering marvel, built without mortar, metal tools, or the wheel. As an icon of Inca civilization, it is a perfect fit for UNESCO's International Day for Monuments and Sites, which has been celebrating important cultural heritage sites for 40 years. Landmarks such as the Pueblo Indian dwellings of Mesa Verde, the Taj Mahal, the Great Pyramid of Giza, and the Parthenon give us the opportunity to look back at the cultures that came before us and preserve their memory for future generations.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Get out your pen and paper—it's International Haiku Poetry Day! Haikus originated in Japan as the opening segment of a larger poem called a renga. Eventually they became individual poems of their own. A traditional haiku consists of 17 phonetic units—similar to a syllable—in a 5, 7, 5 formation. Though simple, a great haiku creates a sense of beauty and a connection to nature. That connection was captured in the artwork seen here, 'One Thousand Springs,' an installation of 5,000 haikus suspended within a web of red threads by artist Chiharu Shiota. It was part of the 2021 Japan Festival at Kew Royal Botanic Gardens in London. Here's some inspiration for you to write a haiku yourself:
> 
> poetry blooms bright / scattered by the vernal winds / may it take strong root

<summary>Description</summary>

> Is there a simpler joy than flying a kite on a windy day? The date of this magical invention is unknown, but the first written documentation of kite flying comes from China in 200 BCE. There they were initially used to measure distance, but over the years they have been tapped for fishing, sport, science, celebration, communication, and recreation. Kites can take many shapes and be made of various materials, but all of them have a wing surface, a tether, and a bridle that keeps the surface at an angle to the wind. In fact, you can easily make your own, and there's no better time than today: Go Fly a Kite Day.

<summary>Description</summary>

> 'Life imitates art far more than art imitates life.' There is perhaps no better day to ponder these iconic words by Oscar Wilde than World Art Day. Celebrated each April 15, it marks the birthday of Renaissance luminary Leonardo da Vinci. The celebration, which started in 2012, continues to be a beautiful reminder of the power of art and its ability to heal, strengthen, and inspire society. The sculpture in today's image, Italian artist Lorenzo Quinn's 'Together,' displayed near the Great Pyramids of Giza, serves as a fitting commentary on this inimitable power of art and also a symbol of the unbreakable human connection.
