> Today, we're not just offering you an olive branch—we've got the whole tree. November 26 is World Olive Tree Day, so we're taking some time to appreciate this amazing plant. Olive trees were first cultivated in the eastern Mediterranean around 8,000 years ago. From there, they were introduced to the Greek islands and mainland by the Phoenicians, then farther afield, reaching Spain and the western edge of the Mediterranean by around 1000 BCE. The olive branch has been a symbol of peace since ancient times, and olive trees have been grown for their oil, wood, and fruit for millennia.
> 
> The southern region of Puglia in Italy, seen here, has an estimated 60 million olive trees and produces about 40% of the country's olive oil. The oldest olive tree in Puglia, and one of the oldest in Italy, is thought to be almost 4,000 years old and its olives are still used to make oil. The olive grove in today's image also has another link to the past: The structure between the trees is a trullo. These dwellings, made without mortar, are only found in Puglia. They show how deeply rooted the traditions of this region are.

> Masai giraffes roam the vast landscapes of Amboseli National Park in Kenya, as seen in today's image. At 18 feet or more, giraffes are the world's tallest land mammals. Along with prehensile tongues that are more than a foot and a half long, they use their impressive height to eat foliage found almost 20 feet from the ground. They're also faster than you might think, being able to sprint over short distances up to 37 mph. Giraffes are common in East Africa and can be seen grazing in grasslands, woodlands, and reserves.
> 
> Established 50 years ago, Amboseli National Park covers more than 150 square miles. Its swamps and wetlands teem with wildlife, including 400 species of birds, 40 of which are birds of prey. During safaris, people can see giraffes and four of Africa's 'Big Five' animals up close—lions, leopards, elephants, and African buffalo. Amboseli offers visitors a glimpse into the traditional Maasai way of life through cultural interactions, livestock herding, and coexistence with wildlife.

> Sonoma Coast State Park offers a picturesque retreat with its sandy beaches, natural arches, and secluded coves. Established in 1934, the park encompasses 17 miles of Northern California coastline between Jenner and Bodega Bay. Wildlife enthusiasts can spot seals, sea lions, whales, and a variety of birds like towhees, warblers, finches, sparrows, and orioles. History buffs will enjoy exploring the sea stack formation with rubbing marks believed to have been made by mammoths that roamed the area 40,000 years ago. The park is also home to historical sites like Bodega Head, where Russians built a fort in the early 1800s.
> 
> Fort Ross, near the park, was established in 1812 by the Russian-American Company. This settlement marked the southernmost expansion of Russian colonization in North America. The fort primarily served as a hub for the fur trade, focusing on hunting sea otters along the Pacific coast. By the mid-1830s, the fur trade had declined, and in 1841, the fort was sold to John Sutter, an American entrepreneur.

<summary>Description</summary>

> On Fibonacci Day, mathematicians and scientists honor one of their own: Leonardo Bonacci, better known as Fibonacci. The medieval mathematician popularized the Hindu-Arabic numeral system, with its use of zero, decimal points, and 10 numbers instead of the ponderous Roman numeral system. He's most famous, however, for his sequence of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8... By adding the first two numbers, you arrive at the third, and adding the previous two numbers, you arrive at the next number, and so on. Disregarding the zero, the first four numbers correspond to today's date, 11/23.
> 
> The Fibonacci sequence is also related to a mathematical phenomenon called the golden ratio, an irrational number that begins 1.61803 but whose terms go on forever after the decimal point. It is found in nature, including the spiral shapes of nautilus shells, sunflower seeds, pinecones, and the leaves of the spiral aloe plant in today's image. It is also found in the relationship between adjacent numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. As successive Fibonacci numbers above 5 are divided by the previous number, the answer gets ever closer to the golden ratio. These mysterious numbers intertwine in nature, creating beautiful patterns in unexpected places.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Perched atop a sandstone outcrop high in the Sierra de Caldereros stands the Castle of Zafra. When the Christian kingdoms of northern Spain took the region from its Moorish defenders in the 12th century, they built this castle on the site of an older fortress to defend the borderland between the two powers. Over the years, it withstood countless battles of the Reconquista—the military campaigns waged by Christian kingdoms against Muslim rule in Spain—and of the Castilian Civil War of the 14th century.
> 
> When the fighting ended in the late 15th century, the Castle of Zafra was no longer strategically important and began to fall into ruin. In 1971, Don Antonio Sanz Polo, a descendant of the castle's last warden, bought the site from the Spanish state. He then spent the next 30 years restoring the castle. These days, you're more likely to see the Castle of Zafra on the screen than in a history book—it doubled as the Tower of Joy in the sixth season of 'Game of Thrones.'

> Curious about what it's like to be a lion cub living in the wild? Let's explore their life. African lion cubs like those featured here, sunbathing in the wilderness of South Africa, start life tucked away in a secluded den. Blind at birth, these little ones are vulnerable in the first few weeks of their lives and depend entirely on their mothers. At around 8 weeks old, they meet the rest of the pride and learn to socialize so they can find their place in the group. After they hit 6 months, they begin to go out hunting with adults, learning essential skills through real-life adventures.
> 
> Lions enter adolescence around 2 years old, and they reach maturity by 3 or 4. At this point, young males leave their mothers and group with other males, while females remain to hunt and breed in the same pride. For the lion cubs in today's image, their early experiences will lay the foundation for their place in the wild.

> What's more creative than a young mind? This World Children's Day, let's celebrate the boundless imagination of kids and the ideas they bring to life. A UNICEF initiative, this day is a global day of action for children, by children, which marks the UN's adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Kids are raising their voices on issues ranging from conflict and climate change to mental health and discrimination, in a bid to influence the future.
> 
> Featured in today's image is the giant land art painting 'Beyond Crisis' in Leysin, Switzerland. It was created by French contemporary artist Saype in 2020 in response to the pandemic. Saype is renowned for his ultra-realistic giant nature paintings—this fresco spanned over 32,000 square feet—made using biodegradable paint. Through the eyes of a little girl gazing at the horizon, the artist envisioned a more united and humane world. The arc of figures she draws serves as a powerful reminder that, in times of crisis, we must focus on what lies ahead together.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
