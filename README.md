<summary>Description</summary>

> It's time for some black-and-white thinking. January 31 is International Zebra Day, celebrating the stripey creatures pictured here in Rietvlei Nature Reserve, South Africa. There are three species of zebra: plains, mountain, and Grévy's, and several subspecies. The mother and foal on our homepage are Burchell's zebras, a subspecies of the plains zebra. Found across eastern and southern Africa, zebras thrive in savannas, shrublands, woodlands, and mountain regions. They spend most of their time eating grasses, leaves, and shrubs, and can travel hundreds of miles in search of food and water. Sadly, all three species are under threat due to hunting and habitat destruction. International Zebra Day aims to raise awareness of conservation efforts, to help protect these striking creatures.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to the tiny Spanish village of Aýna, in a steep valley carved by the River Mundo in the Sierra del Segura range. This part of the Castile-La Mancha region is sometimes called Manchegan Switzerland, thanks to those snow-capped peaks during the winter months. The steep, rocky terrain here means the villagers, of whom there are less than 1,000, cultivate the land on terraces dug into the mountainside. To see Aýna from this perspective, you'll need to visit the Mirador del Diablo, or Devil's Viewpoint, one of several viewing areas dotted around this picturesque valley.

> This chilly scene captures Austria's stunning Golling Waterfall, less than 20 miles south of the city of Salzburg. Tumbling down in two stages from the mouth of the Schwarzbachfall cave, the 249-foot fall is a sight to behold in every season—whether it's framed by the lush greenery of spring or the icy embrace of winter. This region is known for its natural wonders and is also home to the world’s biggest ice cave, Eisriesenwelt, and the narrow Salzachöfen Gorge, considered to be the birthplace of white-water kayaking. Whether you are into hiking, photography, or just looking to spend some quality time in nature, this is a great Austrian destination.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Narrow waterways run like veins through the Australian Outback's Channel Country, a sprawling, ancient flood plain named after its crisscrossing river channels. The huge flat area is transformed from a parched desert canvas to a vibrant tapestry of wildflowers when rainfall is abundant. Indigenous Australians have lived off this land for tens of thousands of years and some offer tours and classes about how to survive in the Outback. This unspoiled region is also home to a bonanza of wildlife—kangaroos that bounce along the plains, strutting emus, and preening purple-crowned fairywrens. If you're lucky, you might even spot a bilby—a nocturnal marsupial with rabbit-like ears. So, are you ready to 'channel' your inner explorer?

<summary>Description</summary>

> A chilly paradise awaits at the St. Paul Winter Carnival! This annual celebration, taking place between January 25 and February 4 this year, transforms Minnesota's capital city into a winter wonderland. It all started in 1885, when a group of reporters visited and referred to Minnesota as another Siberia, unfit for human habitation. This offended city officials who devised a plan to showcase the area's winter beauty. The Winter Carnival was born, featuring seasonal activities such as bobsledding and ice horse-racing. Today, the carnival attracts visitors and strengthens community bonds through parades, markets, and winter sports. And ice sculptors carve stunning but fleeting works of art, like the frozen palace towering over today's image.

> While other owls spend their days sleeping off the night before, the northern hawk-owl is a bird of a different feather. One of the few owls active during the day, that piercing gaze scours the boreal forests of North America, Europe, and Asia for prey. Northern hawk-owls aren't picky eaters: Mice, rats, voles, lemmings, rabbits, shrews, moles, and the occasional frog are all on the menu. These vocal birds have different calls for mating, chatting with their young, and warning that danger is nearby. If you get too close to their nest, protective parents have been known to swoop at humans to keep them away.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Ynys Llanddwyn is a tiny tidal island which, at low tide, is attached to the Isle of Anglesey in Wales. Ynys means 'island' in Welsh and Llanddwyn means 'the church of Dwynwen,' the country's patron saint of lovers.
> 
> Legend has it that Dwynwen, a 5th-century Welsh princess, sought solace on this island after a tragic love story. The young woman fell in love with a commoner, but because her royal father forbade the union—and briefly turned her beloved into a block of ice—she moved to the island and set up a convent. She dedicated her life to spirituality, living as a hermit and helping others with matters of the heart. The ruins of Dwynwen's church, a well, and a convent remain on Ynys Llanddwyn and St. Dwynwen's Day, on January 25, is the most romantic day in Wales—the country's very own Valentine's Day.
