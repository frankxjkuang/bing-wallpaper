> Welcome to 2024! Did you stay up late to ring in the new year? If so, we wouldn't blame you for sleeping in like this red fox in Abruzzo, Italy. Whenever you wake up, New Year's Day is a great opportunity for reflection, planning, and a sense of renewal for the year ahead. January 1 has been a big day since the Julian calendar was widely adopted in 45 BCE—modified in 1582 by the Gregorian calendar to better calculate for leap years. Whether you're watching a parade, attending a sports game, taking a chilly dip, or writing resolutions, we hope it's the beginning of a great year to come.

> It's the final countdown! Tonight is New Year's Eve, time to see out the old year and welcome the new. But how you celebrate depends which country you're in. If you're not in the US watching the Times Square Ball Drop, you might smash crockery in Denmark, eat 12 grapes as the clock strikes midnight in Spain, or hang onions outside your door in Greece. In Thailand, you might watch the fireworks illuminating Phra Nakhon Khiri, or 'holy city hill,' a historical park spread over three peaks overlooking the city of Phetchaburi. Wherever you celebrate, have a great one. See you next year!

As travelers cross the Daiichi Tadami River Bridge, pictured in today's image, they are treated to gorgeous vistas of the river below and the forests that blanket the area. After a snowfall, the icy blue water of the Tadami River cuts a bold streak through the forest, providing a welcome splash of color in a blanket of white.

> Welcome to Amsterdam! The capital of the Netherlands charms visitors with its historic canals, versatile architecture, and laid-back vibe. The city's history can be traced back to the 12th century when it was a fishing village on the banks of the Amstel River. Institutions like the Van Gogh Museum, the Eye Film Museum, and the National Maritime Museum offer insights into its history and arts legacy. Amsterdam's canal ring area, built at the turn of the 17th century, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city is also home to its fair share of restaurants, vintage shops, and outdoor markets in neighborhoods like Oud-West, pictured in today's image. Get ready to pedal because Amsterdam's cycling culture is ubiquitous. With approximately 320 miles of bike lanes, it's one of the most bike-friendly cities in the world.

> Today is a special milestone for our furry, scaly, and feathered friends: the Endangered Species Act is turning 50. This landmark legislation, signed into law in 1973, has been helping species on the brink for half a century. Who's that in the spotlight? A humpback whale! Known for their haunting songs and acrobatic breaches, these gentle giants are a success story of the ESA. They were once on the edge of extinction, largely due to commercial whaling, but thanks to conservation efforts, their population has bounced back from around 5,000 in 1966 to an estimated 135,000 today. However, our work isn't over. Challenges persist, from habitat loss to poaching. So, what can we do? Spread the word, support conservation efforts, participate in local initiatives, and be eco-friendly.

> From glaciers and waterfalls to volcanoes and black sand beaches, Iceland's Snæfellsnes peninsula has 'GoT' it all. Pictured here is the 1,519-foot-high Kirkjufell, a hill often called 'Church Mountain,' as it is said to resemble a steeple. In fact, it is a nunatak, a rock formation that protrudes through an ice sheet or glacier. You might recognize it from the 'Game of Thrones' series, where it featured in a scene set north of the colossal ice wall. When it's not starring on TV, it is popular with photographers thanks to its unusual shape, coastal location, and colors that shift with the seasons. And if you're lucky, and the weather conditions align, Kirkjufell offers a magnificent view of the northern lights.

Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
