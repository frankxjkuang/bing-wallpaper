<summary>Description</summary>

> If today's photo evokes some chilly feelings inside of you, surprise! That's not snow, but part of the largest gypsum dune field on the planet. We're at White Sands National Park in New Mexico, which was first established as a monument on this date in 1933 and then became a national park in 2019. Roughly 4.5 billion tons of gypsum sand has massed in the Tularosa Basin over the past 12,000 years, having worn off the surrounding mountains. Thousands of species live in the park, many of which have evolved to have white coloration, allowing them to blend into the environment.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> The Muniellos Nature Reserve is one of Spain's best-preserved forests of Quercus robur, otherwise known as common oak, European oak, or English oak. The 13,560-acre reserve in Asturias province also includes sessile oaks, seen in our photo alongside beech trees.
> 
> In the 1970s logging was banned in the reserve. Soon after, hunting was also banned. Today, even human access to this UNESCO-designated biosphere is carefully controlled. There's a visitor center, and that's about as far as most tourists are allowed. We're just glad we have photos of this incredible forest.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> This striking memorial to Civil Rights icon Martin Luther King, Jr., displays 14 powerful quotes from his speeches and writings. The Inscription Wall, in Washington DC, lets the visitor browse the quotes without the structure of a timeline—the earliest quote dates to 1956 and the Montgomery Bus Boycott; the most recent is taken from Dr. King's sermon at the National Cathedral in Washington just four days before he was assassinated.
> 
> While the quotations float freely in time, there is a clear overarching theme. The National Park Service explains that the inscriptions 'stress four primary messages of Dr. King: justice, democracy, hope, and love.'
> 
> Perhaps surprisingly, there are no quotes from Dr. King's famous 'I Have a Dream' speech. That's not an oversight, though: The whole memorial has that legendary speech as its theme.

> Originally built out of wood in the late 13th century, the cathedral was expanded in the 14th and 15th centuries, mainly using stone as construction material. Despite this, it was badly damaged in the Great Fire of Turku, which consumed much of the city in 1827. The cathedral was rebuilt over the next few years.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This fuzzy donkey feeding on the leaves of a cherry tree probably doesn't know that today was once celebrated as the Feast of the Donkey. We think any day is a good day to celebrate donkeys. They've carried the load for humans for more than 7,000 years, so let's give them some love. More than 40 million donkeys do the heavy lifting around the world today, with 11 million in China alone.
> 
> Medieval Christians celebrated January 14 as the Feast of the Donkey, or Feast of the Ass—acknowledging the importance of donkeys in the Bible. The passage of Mary, Joseph, and their newborn son into Egypt was usually depicted with Mary and her child riding on a donkey. The festival fell out of favor by the 15th century.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> All along the Pacific Coast of North America, giant stands of kelp up to 100 feet high, like this one in California's Channel Islands, provide habitat for a vast number of fish, invertebrates, and sea mammals. Giant kelp, technically a type of brown algae, is the largest of all seaweed and one of the fastest-growing of any organism—as much as 2 feet per day! The gas-filled pods you see in this image help the kelp float. Like the trees in the Amazon, the kelp forests of our oceans are key to the health of marine life.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Though Türkiye usually lives up to expectations as a warm Mediterranean country, snow occasionally falls here. This winter dusting of Istanbul, Türkiye's largest city, brings into sharper focus the lines of Rumelihisarı in the center of our image. The structure, also known as Rumeli Fortress, was built in the 15th century by an Ottoman sultan as a way to choke naval traffic through the narrow Bosporus Strait. The Bosporus connects the Sea of Marmara to the Black Sea, separating Istanbul into what are often referred to as its 'European side' and 'Asian side.' Today, the fortress isn't used to fire upon ships but serves as a museum and concert venue. While the place has changed over the centuries, the killer view hasn't.
