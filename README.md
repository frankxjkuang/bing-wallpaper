> New York City's skyline is instantly recognizable, even when half-covered in fog. Eight of the United States' 10 tallest buildings reside there, all in the borough of Manhattan. One of New York City's most famous landmarks, the Empire State Building, was the world's tallest building for 41 years.
> 
> When it was completed in 1931, it towered over New York City's skyline, the first building in the world to be more than 100 stories tall. But in the decades since, it has been joined by scores of other skyscrapers and is now the Big Apple's seventh-tallest building. While it may have been overtaken by some of its younger neighbors, the Empire State Building remains one of the most iconic features of New York's skyline, if you can see it through the fog.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to the largest state park in the golden state of California, Anza-Borrego. Located about 100 miles northeast of San Diego, the park is well known for its spectacular springtime wildflowers, stunning landscapes, and natural marvels. Spring and early summer are the best times to visit. That's when you'll find a myriad of magnificent, blooming species of flowers, including dune primrose, desert sunflowers, and desert sand verbena. These hardy wildflowers can survive in extreme heat and with little water–perfect for California's driest state park, in which some areas get just 2 inches of rain a year.
> 
> Heavier rains than usual brought a rare 'winter bloom' of wildflowers to Anza-Borrego earlier this year. And record-breaking rainstorms have continued, ensuring an excellent spring display. The wildflowers draw large crowds of tourists to the area. Though you might be tempted to take some home, the wildflowers are protected by state law and should be left for everyone to enjoy.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This stunning staircase spirals up through three floors at Heal's department store in central London, where it has been helping shoppers get around in stylish fashion since 1916. It was designed by architect Cecil Brewer ahead of the opening of an in-store art gallery. While the gallery no longer exists, the Cecil Brewer Staircase remains a popular part of the store's heritage, particularly with photographers looking to capture a little London glamour. The lights at the outer edge of the stairs were added after World War II, and the elegant chandelier cascading from top to bottom was installed in 2013. If you visit, keep an eye out for a bronze cat on a windowsill overlooking the stairs, the store's not-for-sale official mascot.

<summary>Description</summary>

> These pristine, white blooms are wild garlic plants, probably not what comes to mind when you think of flowers. You can get a closer look if you visit the Hainich National Park in Thuringia, Germany. This national park was founded in 1997 to protect its ancient beech forest, which is full of lush deciduous trees.
> 
> Wild garlic is a woodland messenger of spring in temperate climates around the world. Native to Europe and Asia, it's widely grown and enjoyed in Germany—so much so that many cities organize festivals to celebrate this pungent plant. The German town of Eberbach has trademarked its claim to be a wild garlic capital and hosts a month-long wild garlic fair every spring.

<summary>Description</summary>

> They might look like spaceships from a retro sci-fi movie, but these strange shapes hovering above the mountains in Patagonia are of earthly origin. These are lenticular clouds, named after their lens-like shape. They form near hills and mountains where moist air is pushed up and over the peaks, cooling as it rises and condensing into water droplets. As wind blows over the mountains it can create a series of waves in the air, and these unusual clouds form in the crest of those waves.
> 
> Today is World Meteorological Day, which marks the establishment of the World Meteorological Organization in 1950. The group shares information between countries so the world can benefit from better understanding and predicting our weather. Thanks to meteorology, we can explain atmospheric phenomena like lenticular clouds. Although, with their unusual shape, they still get mistaken for flying saucers from time to time.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Lake Powell, which meanders across the Utah-Arizona border, was created when the Glen Canyon Dam was built on the Colorado River in the 1960s. It is one of the two largest reservoirs in the US, alongside its downstream neighbor Lake Mead. Together, they provide water to about 40 million people in seven states, while their respective dams generate crucial hydroelectric power.
> 
> But the Colorado River basin has been experiencing its driest period for more than 12 centuries, intensified by climate change. That white line at the base of the canyon walls shows the old high-water mark. Last year, Lake Powell dropped to just over 24% of its full capacity, raising concerns about both water and power supplies.
> 
> Globally, about 2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water. The United Nations created World Water Day in 1993 to highlight the issue and encourage more sustainable water management. As our population increases, it's vital that we all do our part to save precious fresh water.

> Wherever there is light, there is color. It lends liveliness and character to the world around us, but we can also use it strategically to convey particular tones and messages. Blue creates a sense of tranquility, purple gives a sense of luxury, and red can express passion or danger. On International Color Day, organizations around the world meet to discuss research and share knowledge about color theory and its use in the fields of industry, arts, science, and design. As you go about your day, stop and take in the colors around you and think about why they were chosen and how they make you feel. It might just make you consider how you use color in your own life.
