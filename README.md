> Among untamed rainforests, rice paddies, and steep ravines lies the village of Ubud, the cultural heart of Bali, Indonesia. According to legend, a Hindu priest, Rsi Markandaya, arrived at the island of Bali in the 8th century, discovering an area abundant in medicinal herbs and plants. The village's name derives from the word 'ubad,' meaning medicine. Nestled within the verdant landscape, the village is rich in Hindu temples and local mythology. The mythical character seen in today’s image is Barong, a panther-like creature, the king of spirits, and a symbol of good fortune and prosperity. The Barong dance, performed in a decorated animal mask, is native to Bali.

> It's time to get pedaling. The Tour de France, the world's most famous bike race, is starting today. Beginning in Florence, Italy, the 2024 Tour will cover 2,170 miles and will be a little different from previous years. The final finish line has always been in Paris; however, this year the French capital will be busy getting ready for the Olympic Games so the race will end in Nice, on France's Mediterranean coast.
> 
> The route changes every year but always follows the same format: 21 day-long stages held over 23 or 24 days to give the riders a few rest days. The race covers a range of terrains, and there are always mountain stages in the Alps and the Pyrenees. The Tour de France has passed through every French region, including the French island of Corsica for the 100th edition in 2013. In today's image, riders take on the third stage of the 2013 Tour, between Ajaccio and Calvi on Corsica.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Fifty-five years ago today, an act of resistance marked a turning point in the fight for LGBTQIA+ rights. In the early hours of June 28, 1969, New York City Police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich Village. At the time, homosexuality was illegal, and such raids were common. However, that night, the patrons of the Stonewall Inn, fed up with the continued harassment, stood their ground. Violence escalated, leading to clashes between protesters and police. In the following days, there was more rioting as people gathered to protest the raids.
> 
> On June 28 the following year, gay pride marches were held in New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago to mark the anniversary of the riots. Similar marches began to be held annually across the US and the rest of the world. June 28 is now celebrated as International LGBTQIA+ Pride Day. In 2016, the Stonewall Inn, Christopher Park, and nearby streets were officially dedicated as the Stonewall National Monument. So, today is the perfect time to remember those who have fought for LGBTQIA+ rights before, during, and after Stonewall.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to Florence, the cradle of the Renaissance. Let the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore transport you through time. More than just a church, this Gothic structure, with its red-tiled dome, is steeped in centuries of history. Built over an older cathedral, construction began in 1296 under the supervision of architect Arnolfo di Cambio. Italian architect Filippo Brunelleschi engineered its dome, the largest brick dome ever constructed. Its completion in 1436 was the final stage of the cathedral's construction. It's not just the outside that dazzles; inside there are artistic treasures to discover, from Giorgio Vasari's fresco 'The Last Judgment' to Paolo Uccello's intricate clock face. The cathedral complex is also home to the Baptistery, a small basilica, and Giotto's Campanile, a free-standing bell tower.
> 
> Step inside, and you're walking on history—every visit gives a glimpse of the past and a demonstration of human potential.

> Dive deep beneath the waves surrounding the Banggai Islands in Indonesia and meet the Banggai cardinalfish. Cardinalfish have tiny, shimmery bodies with black vertical stripes and white-edged fins, which help to disguise them. Unlike some finned creatures that migrate long distances, these pint-sized fish inhabit a small world, rarely straying far from their local reefs.
> 
> Each young cardinalfish begins life being guarded by their fathers, who carry the eggs in their mouths for up to 30 days to shield them from the aquatic perils. Within these jaws, young fish embark on a silent metamorphosis, soon to emerge, ready to explore the currents. In their early stages, they form dense schools for protection against predators and hide among the spines of sea urchins and anemones. The diet of these opportunistic feeders primarily consists of small fish, crustaceans, and plankton. Their existence whispers tales of resilience—a creature to cherish and protect for the spectacle of life it presents.

> Amid the arid expanse of the Mojave Desert in Nevada lies Valley of Fire State Park. Named after its red Aztec Sandstone, an Early Jurassic formation made from ancient sand dunes, the park stretches across 46,000 acres. Featured on our homepage is one of its highlights, Fire Wave, a geological marvel that appears like a frozen wave with its red, pink, and white stripes.
> 
> In the park, you will also come across mysterious petroglyphs, rock carvings left by the Ancestral Puebloans, farmers from the nearby Moapa Valley. It is likely they practiced hunting and performed religious ceremonies in this area. If you are a history buff, you might want to try and decode the messages carved on the rock faces. This forbidding landscape is also home to ancient, petrified trees, natural sandstone arches, and narrow slot canyons carved by water over millions of years.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Atop Kelimutu, a volcano on the Indonesian island of Flores, sit three lakes, each with its own hue and folklore. Volcanic vents deep within the Earth release steam and gas that alter the lakes' mineral compositions, creating different colors, which can change independently. The westernmost lake, Tiwu Ata Bupu (Lake of Old People), not pictured, normally has a dark blue hue. Meanwhile, Tiwu Ko'o Fai Nuwa Muri (Lake of Young Men and Maidens), tends to be light green or light blue and Tiwu Ata Polo (Bewitched or Enchanted Lake) can be red, dark green, blue or brown. The local Lio people revere these lakes, believing them to be the resting place of souls.

Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
