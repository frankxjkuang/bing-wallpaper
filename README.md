<summary>Description</summary>

> With nearly 1,200 islands spread over a chain of 26 atolls, the Maldives are popular with tourists seeking serene beaches, scuba diving, and surf in the Indian Ocean. The atolls, like those pictured on our homepage, are made up of coral reefs that formed around the top of now-sunken volcanoes. Some are single, ring-shaped islands enclosing lagoons while other atolls are a series of small, connected islets, many of which are uninhabited.
> 
> The country is also home to Baa Atoll, a UNESCO biosphere reserve whose numerous coral reefs, islands, and mangroves make it a globally important habitat for species including whale sharks, manta rays, and marine turtles. The Maldives archipelago is rich in biodiversity but faces an existential threat from climate change. As lowest-lying country in the world, much of which is less than 4 feet above sea level, it is extremely vulnerable to rising sea levels. By the end of the century, it is thought that the islands could disappear altogether.

> Step to the western edge of America, where the Walton Lighthouse, also known as the Santa Cruz Breakwater Lighthouse, is a beacon for passing ships. Built in 2002, this 40-foot-tall building replaced a more modest light. The Walton Lighthouse got its name from Charles Walton, a businessman who helped fund its construction in memory of his brother Derek, a merchant seaman who died at sea during World War II.
> 
> Santa Cruz has been a busy port city since the mid-1800s, when ships would unload lime, redwood, and other agricultural products. These days, Santa Cruz Harbor is home to a commercial fishing fleet, as well as a popular place to rent kayaks, boats, and paddleboards.

> Have you ever been captivated by a squirrel crossing your path? January 21 is Squirrel Awareness Day, honoring these furry seed distributors. Today's homepage star is the Eurasian red squirrel, whose striking reddish-brown coat, white underbelly, and bushy tail are a familiar sight in several countries. These squirrels are not only exceptional jumpers—capable of leaping up to 6 feet in one jump—they can even swim to search for food. They gather nuts and acorns in the autumn and hide them, to see them through the winter months. If you spot fuzzy-tailed squirrels frolicking in your backyard, they might also appreciate a feeding station stocked with treats such as raspberries or crab apples.

> Let's flap our flippers and dive into Penguin Awareness Day! Today's image features macaroni penguins swimming in the plankton-rich waters of the Drake Passage off the coast of Chile. These charming creatures, one of 18 different species of penguin in the Southern Hemisphere, can be recognized by their flashy amber crests and orange beaks. The name is said to have been coined by English sailors, derived from a term used to describe flamboyant dressers in the late 18th century.
> 
> Macaroni penguins can be a bad-tempered bunch who get into noisy fights. To avoid this, males often ease their way through crowded colonies with their heads tucked down to their chests. The main threats though, are not their fellow penguins. Reduced food availability, fishing nets, and the impact of climate change on sea ice are among challenges faced by this species, which has been classified as vulnerable due to population decline.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Why visit one lake when you can visit 16? Plitvice Lakes National Park in Croatia serves up stunning terraced lakes connected to one another by more than 90 cascades and waterfalls, thanks to the unique geology of the area.
> 
> The surrounding mountains funnel water carrying calcium carbonate into the park. This accumulates and hardens over time into a type of limestone called tufa, which creates a series of barriers. These natural dams form pools, with thin, lacy waterfalls leading from one 'lake' to another. This majestic display draws more than a million visitors a year to the paths and boardwalks that wind through the lakes, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Even in winter, the lakes retain their beauty, with once-roaring waterfalls frozen in place.

> The 'golden hour' just before sunset is the perfect time to take in views of Paris' most ornate bridge, the Pont Alexandre III. Arching over the Seine, the bridge was opened in 1900 and named after a Russian tsar, celebrating a new alliance between the two countries. Befitting the nobility of the event, two 56-foot columns sit on each bank of the river, crowned with gilt-bronze sculptures of the winged horse Pegasus. From the center of the bridge, standing above reliefs decorated with nymphs and beneath Art Nouveau-style lamps, you can admire some famous Parisian monuments. Views include the Esplanade des Invalides, the Grand Palais and Petit Palais museums, and the Eiffel Tower.

> This Eurasian wolf, curled up for a winter nap in the Bavarian Forest National Park, can rest easy knowing it is an apex predator around these parts. This park covers 93 square miles of the wider forest, where it sits on Germany's border with Czechia. The softly rolling mountains Great Rachel, Little Rachel, and Little Arber pose modest challenges for hikers as they wander through stands of Norway spruce. The forest teems with life, including lynxes, bears, pygmy owls, and Eurasian wolves, like our sleepy homepage friend. These wolves form a close-knit pack led by an alpha pair and have been spotted in the park after decades of being hunted out of Western Europe.
