<summary>Description</summary>

> Ever heard coins clinking louder than applause? That's the Trevi Fountain in Rome, Italy, for you—a spot where history, hope, and selfie sticks collide. Completed in 1762, it marks the endpoint of one of ancient Rome's earliest aqueducts, the Aqua Virgo, which still supplies water today. The name 'Trevi' comes from Tre Vie—'three roads'—signifying the junction where it stands. Designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi and finished by Giuseppe Pannini, this 86-foot marvel is the largest Baroque fountain in the city and one of the most famous in the world. Its sculptures show Oceanus, the god of the sea, surrounded by Tritons and horses.

> Visitors come for the view but stay for the ritual: toss a coin over your left shoulder and make a wish. Legend says one coin guarantees a return to Rome, two bring love, and three lead to marriage. Around $3,000 to $4,000 worth of coins are thrown daily—roughly $1.5 million a year—all donated to charity. From the iconic 1960 film 'La Dolce Vita' to LEGO's Trevi Fountain set, and even a replica near Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, this masterpiece still inspires. So, what would you wish for?

<summary>Description</summary>

> Gwalior, in Madhya Pradesh, is not just a city; it is a chapter of India's history. Towering over the skyline, Gwalior Fort is a 6th-century hill fort shaped by generations of rulers and wrapped in legend. Nicknamed 'the Gibraltar of India,' this fort was praised by Mughal emperor Babur as the 'pearl among the fortresses of Hind' for its strength and grandeur. The fort has seen rulers from the Tomars to the Mughals and is linked to battles, royal intrigue, and hidden treasures.
> 
> The fort has six palaces, two of which were built by Raja Man Singh Tomar, who reigned from 1486 to 1516. The architecture reflects a blend of Hindu and Mughal styles. Key landmarks include the Man Mandir Palace, with its turquoise-tiled exterior, and the Sas-Bahu Temples, dedicated to Lord Aniruddha and Lord Shiva. Teli Temple, a rectangular shrine without pillared pavilions, stands out among other such structures. Secret passages and hidden vaults hint at treasures long rumored to be stored inside.
> 
> As the sun sets behind the walls, a sound and light show brings the fort alive, narrating stories of kings, warriors, and dynasties. The majestic Gwalior Fort draws visitors into history that lingers long after they have left.

> Look closely at this ammonite fossil. Its swirling shell, once home to a prehistoric sea creature, holds a mathematical secret—a spiral pattern. Each new chamber is proportionally larger than the previous one, maintaining a consistent growth ratio, often associated with the Fibonacci sequence.
> 
> Each November 23, we celebrate Fibonacci Day, named after the 13th-century Italian mathematician Leonardo Bonacci (Fibonacci), who introduced the concept to Europe. The pattern 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8…—where each number is the sum of the two before it—was, however, first described in India as early as 200 BCE by the ancient poet-mathematician Pingala. The Fibonacci sequence appears widely in nature, including pineapples, artichokes, pinecones, and the arrangement of leaves on a stem.
> 
> Ammonites were mollusks that lived between 400 and 66 million years ago, gliding through ancient seas inside coiled shells that protected their soft bodies. When ammonites perished, sediment buried their shells, and minerals slowly turned them to stone, preserving this natural geometry for millions of years. Today, the ammonite fossil is a striking reminder that math and nature speak the same language.

<summary>Description</summary>

> There are big statues—and then there's the Leshan Giant Buddha. Carved into a riverside cliff at the confluence of the Min, Qingyi, and Dadu Rivers in Sichuan, China, this statue is an ancient engineering marvel. Construction began in 713 CE under a monk named Hai Tong, who hoped that the Buddha's presence would calm dangerous river currents that threatened passing boats. He was so devoted that when funding ran out, he reportedly gouged out his own eyes to prove his sincerity. Construction took roughly 90 years and was completed long after Hai Tong's death. At 233 feet tall, it is the largest stone Buddha in the world. Its shoulders stretch about 92 feet wide, its ears measure nearly 23 feet long, and each foot extends over 28 feet. Drainage channels built inside the statue protect it from erosion, helping explain its remarkable preservation for more than 12 centuries.
> 
> Together with the Mount Emei Scenic Area, the Leshan Giant Buddha became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Although time, weather, and pollution have taken their toll, continuous conservation work ensures it remains one of China's most treasured cultural landmarks.

> This harbor seal, photographed at Robert Moses State Park on Long Island, New York, seems to be onto something—spreading good vibes, one wave at a time. That's exactly the spirit of World Hello Day, celebrated every November 21. This cheerful observance began in 1973 when two American brothers, Brian and Michael McCormack, launched it as a peaceful response to global tensions. They mailed 1,360 letters in seven languages to world leaders, inviting them to join the first celebration. Their message was simple yet powerful: personal communication can help preserve peace. Today, people in more than 180 countries participate.
> 
> Seals, it turns out, raise their flippers primarily for thermoregulation. But to us, it looks like they're saying 'hello,' making them the perfect mascots for the day. So, as you look at this waving seal, take its cue: say hello to someone new today—a neighbor, a coworker, or even a passerby. One word might just make a ripple of peace across your own little sea.

> On the lawns of the United Nations headquarters in Geneva, two children lean over a blank page, sketching the world as they dream it could be. This scene unfolds in 'World in Progress II,' a monumental land art painting created by Swiss-French artist Saype in 2020. Made with biodegradable paint, the artwork depicts the vision and innocence at the heart of World Children's Day—a spirit mirrored in today's featured image. Look closer, and you'll spot the artist himself posing with his artwork.
> 
> Each year on November 20, the world unites to celebrate children and defend their rights. What began in 1954 as a UN initiative grew into a landmark observance anchored by two historic milestones: the 1959 Declaration and the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child. These commitments have carved a global promise—one that speaks of education, equality, safety, and the simple right to be heard.
> 
> Today, UNICEF and communities around the world carry this vision forward through campaigns, conversations, and moments that encourage adults to pause—and truly listen to what children have to say.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Step closer, and the details begin to speak—every stone, spire, and statue seems to hold a story of its own. Conceived in the late 19th century, the Hungarian Parliament Building was designed to reflect a nation's ambition, blending Gothic Revival elegance with distinctly Hungarian motifs. Architect Imre Steindl's vision took shape over two decades through the work of more than 1,000 craftsmen. Even the central dome, rising 315 feet (96 meters) high, carries meaning: the height honors the year of Hungary's millennium anniversary in 1896. Completed in 1904, the building still dominates Budapest's skyline as a powerful national symbol.
> 
> Step inside, and the richness deepens. Gold leaf shimmers across staircases and halls, while statues of rulers and national figures line the corridors, turning history into spectacle. Beyond its political role, the Parliament has become a cultural emblem—hosting state ceremonies, welcoming millions of visitors annually, and earning UNESCO World Heritage status. More than a landmark, it continues to tell Hungary's story through the details that first inspired its creation.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
