<summary>Description</summary>

> As twilight descends today, Chiang Mai, Thailand's second-largest city, will come alive with thousands of glowing lanterns for Yi Peng. Held on the full moon of the second month of the Lanna lunar calendar, this celebration is about letting go of negativity and embracing new beginnings. The highlight of the festival is the release of 'khom loi' or 'khom loy'—floating paper lanterns—into the night sky, which becomes a sea of warm, golden lights. People often write their hopes and dreams on the lanterns. They gather around temples and palaces to send their wishes skyward, hoping for good fortune in the year to come.
> 
> In addition to the lantern release, the city hosts vibrant parades, traditional dance performances, and stunning decorations. Yi Peng coincides with Loy Krathong, another festival where small, intricately crafted baskets, decorated with banana leaves, incense, and candles, are floated down rivers. Together, these festivals create a spectacle that draws visitors from across the world to witness the illumination of Chiang Mai.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Known for its rows of pastel houses that stretch down to the Mediterranean Sea, Manarola, seen in today's image, is a picturesque village on the Italian Riviera. Perched on the rugged cliffs of the Ligurian coast, it's one of the five villages that make up Cinque Terre National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The name 'Manarola' might have evolved from the Latin 'Magna rota,' which means 'large wheel,' a nod to the village's historical mill wheel.
> 
> Believed to be the oldest village in the Cinque Terre, dating to 1338, Manarola's history is rooted in fishing and winemaking. Sciacchetrà, a dessert wine unique to this area, has long been immortalized in the verses of Italian poets. Take a walk along the Via dell'Amore, or 'Path of Love'—a scenic coastal trail connecting Manarola to its neighboring village, Riomaggiore—and you can sense the romance and charm that defines this region. Legend has it that the footpath became a meeting place for lovers from the two villages. Time slows down when you're in Manarola, and the magic of the country's coastal heritage comes to life.

> Take a stroll along almost any marina from Costa Rica to Alaska, and you'll likely hear the playful barks of sea lions echo through the air. California sea lions, like the one pictured, are a common sight basking in the sun along the rocky shores of North America's western coast. These marine mammals, belonging to the pinniped group, are often mistaken for seals. An easy way to distinguish between them is by looking at their ears—sea lions have visible flaps, seals don't.
> 
> Sea lions also have a special relationship with giant kelp, seen in today's image from Baja California, Mexico. These towering underwater plants, which can grow up to 175 feet in ideal conditions, sway gently with the currents, creating beautiful scenery. Kelp forests are home to a diverse array of marine life, including sea lions, tiny invertebrates like snails, prawns, and jellyfish, and a wide range of fish, like cod, rockfish, and wrasse. Sea lions twist and turn through the thick kelp strands, hunting fish hiding within the leaves. They also use kelp as refuge from predators like sharks, blending in with the fronds of the brown algae to avoid detection. Kelp's rapid growth makes it an ideal habitat for marine life of all types to thrive.

> Red as far as the eye can see and clear blue skies overhead. Welcome to Arches National Park, Utah. The story of this otherworldly landscape starts 65 million years ago when a dry seabed stood here. Over time, geological forces warped and squeezed the land, twisting the sandstone into lumps and bumps. Later, wind and water carved out the arches, pinnacles, fins, and balanced rocks that now stand in this area. The park has more than 2,000 natural stone arches, the highest concentration of these structures anywhere on Earth. In today's image, we can see two of them: Double Arch, as seen through Cove Arch. The larger arch of Double Arch spans 144 feet and is 112 feet tall, the tallest and second-longest of the park's arches.
> 
> Humans arrived in the area around 10,000 years ago. Fremont and Ancestral Pueblo people lived here until the 14th century. Later, the Ute and Paiute tribes made their homes in the area. In 1929, it was declared a national monument. However, it wasn't until November 12, 1971, that it became a national park. Today, more than 1.8 million visitors come to Arches National Park every year.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Freedom is not free, and nobody understands that better than veterans. Today, America honors its military men and women for their service. The holiday originally celebrated a temporary halt in fighting between Allied nations and Germany during World War I—the official end of the war came the following year in 1919. Armistice Day, as it was later named, commemorated this respite, and it became a federal holiday in 1938. A few years later, America fought in World War II, and later, the Korean War. As a result, Congress amended the holiday in 1954, exchanging the word 'Armistice' with 'Veterans' to include veterans of all the country's wars.
> 
> Today's image depicts the Mural Wall, one of five parts of the Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. Also known as 'The Forgotten War,' the three-year conflict began in 1950 and was one of America's most hard-fought wars. Near the National Mall, the Korean War Veterans Memorial honors the tens of thousands of US service personnel who died or went missing and more than 100,000 soldiers who were wounded.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Ever seen a group of flamingos take to the skies? If you have, there's a good chance they were Caribbean flamingos, also known as American flamingos, as seen in Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico, in today's image. Flamingos are referred to as a flamboyance when in a group, but they can also be called a stand, colony, or pat. The Caribbean flamingo is the largest flamingo species in the Americas and the only one native to North America. These vibrant birds are typically found around brackish and saltwater areas, like marshes, estuaries, and along coastlines. Because of their pink color, they're often confused with roseate spoonbills. However, their long necks and bent bills distinguish them from other wading birds like the great blue heron and wood stork.
> 
> Found across regions like the southeastern United States, northern South America, the Galápagos Islands, and Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula, Caribbean flamingos are well adapted for short migrations in search of food. Using long legs and webbed feet, they hunt shallow waters for shrimp, crustaceans, mollusks, fish, and algae. Their habitats are increasingly threatened by coastal development, pollution, and rising sea levels, putting their population at risk. Yet, Caribbean flamingos still amaze us when they soar gracefully through the skies.

> Get ready for a starry Moroccan night! Stargazing here is truly magical, as the vast skies and minimal light pollution transform each evening into a dazzling display. Every star you see is part of our galaxy, the Milky Way, which appears as a creamy band of light in the darkest skies. In today's image, you can see this cosmic beauty glowing over Aït Benhaddou, a historic fortified village known as a ksar, in the Ouarzazate province of Morocco. This site was first fortified in the 11th century. It was a key stop on the ancient caravan trade route connecting the Sahara and the city of Marrakesh. Perched on a hillside by the Ounila River, this village is a cluster of buildings encircled by a protective wall, complete with towers and a gate.

Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.
