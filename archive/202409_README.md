> Welcome to the Totally Thames Festival in London, England. Each year, it brings together communities, artists, and nature enthusiasts in a month-long tribute to the river. Highlights for 2024 include the annual boat marathon, Great River Race, and the Clean Thames Challenge.
> 
> The Thames, the longest river entirely in England, contains more than 80 islands along its course. Starting in Gloucestershire and winding through cities like Oxford, Windsor, and in today's image, London, it flows for 215 miles before merging with the North Sea. With a range of freshwater and near seawater habitats, the river is a haven for an array of wildlife like mute swans and bottlenose dolphins. It also flanks several Sites of Special Scientific Interest. So, this month, let the river's tide guide you to discovery and celebration.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Sometimes it's nice to get away. Thanks to environmentalist Howard Zahniser, Americans can do that in one of the country's many wildernesses—sheltered from human activities. While the protection of national forests and parks began in the late 1800s, untamed wilderness had dwindled to only 2.5% of US land by the 1960s. To reverse this trend, Zahniser wrote most of what became the Wilderness Act. Signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson on September 3, 1964, today it protects more than 109 million acres—5% of the land in the US.
> 
> Pictured in today's image, Crystal Lake, in the Enchantments, Washington, is in one such protected area. Located in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, the Enchantments region has more than 700 lakes and ponds and some of the best rock climbing in the Western US. It's also home to mountain goats, ptarmigan, pikas, and many alpine flowers. If you want to see Alpine Lakes Wilderness yourself, however, be prepared to wait. Few permits are granted for day hikes, and of the 40,000 people who entered last year's lottery for overnight permits, only 2,558 received one.

> As daylight fades, dusky eagle-owls, the silent hunters seen in today's image, emerge from their nests. These primarily nocturnal raptors were snapped in Pakistan and can be found in the forests and scrublands across South and Southeast Asia. An impressive wingspan of 15–17 inches, piercing yellow eyes, and exceptional hearing help them to catch small mammals and birds with precision in dim light. Measuring up to 2 feet tall, these feathered predators can also be spotted hunting in the daytime when the weather is cloudy. They often live in the abandoned nests of other birds or in natural crevices. Dusky eagle-owls breed in December and January, usually rearing their young in the safety of tall trees or cliff ledges. Nature lovers and bird watchers are captivated by their solemn gaze and elegant stature.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Every first Saturday in September, bird enthusiasts and nature lovers gather to celebrate National Hummingbird Day. This day is dedicated to appreciating these tiny, agile birds and their role as a pollinator in our ecosystem. Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed; they can flap their wings up to 80 times per second, allowing them to hover in place and even fly backward. Emily Dickinson aptly describes their swift movement: 'A Route of Evanescence / With a revolving Wheel—.' Their high metabolism requires them to eat constantly, so they spend their days flitting from flower to flower, sipping nectar and catching insects. Fun fact: these birds can remember every flower they've visited and how long it will take a flower to refill with nectar.
> 
> Let's meet the Anna's hummingbird, seen in today’s image. Named after Anna Masséna, Duchess of Rivoli, it's one of an estimated 366 hummingbird species, and it's the most common species on North America's western coast. With its shimmering emerald feathers and sparkling rose-pink throat, this little bird is a sight to behold. So, today, let's spread our wings of awareness and protect these birds—one garden at a time.

> 'Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope.' These words by former secretary-general of the United Nations Kofi Annan capture the essence of International Literacy Day, celebrated every September 8. Established by UNESCO in 1966, this observance not only celebrates those who can read but also highlights the ongoing battle against illiteracy. With approximately 775 million people worldwide still lacking basic literacy, this day resonates powerfully within the hallowed walls of the Stockholm Public Library in Sweden, or 'Stadsbiblioteket' as it is known to locals, featured in today's image.

> Here, more than 2 million volumes wait to unfold stories in over 100 languages. Designed by architect Erik Gunnar Asplund in the 1920s, this Nordic Classicist composition features the geometry of a cylinder intersecting a cubic base. Its accessible façade belies a treasure trove within a 360-degree rotunda, inviting even the casual reader into a literal circle of knowledge. On this day, let's join in a collective turning of pages in the pursuit of this year's theme—'Promoting multilingual education: Literacy for mutual understanding and peace.'

> Welcome to Iguazu Falls, the largest waterfall system in the world. The name 'Iguazu' has its origins in the regional languages Guarani or Tupi, meaning 'big water.' These epic waterfalls are formed by the Iguazu River, on the border of Argentina's Misiones province and Brazil's Paraná state.
> 
> The Iguazu Falls have long attracted admirers. Spanish explorer Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca is thought to have been the first European to see them in 1541. In 1907, businessman Domingo Ayarragaray saw their potential and built a hotel and roads nearby. The falls became such a sensation that they were designated as national parks in both countries—Argentina's Iguazu National Park in 1934 and Brazil's Iguaçu National Park in 1939. UNESCO made the parks World Heritage Sites in 1984 and 1986, respectively. Surrounded by the rainforest, the falls are made up of hundreds of cascades and channels carved over millions of years by the Iguazu River, the tallest of which is the U-shaped Devil's Throat, at 269 feet high.

Stretching nearly 8 miles, it was Europe's longest bridge when it opened in 1998, built to ease traffic on Lisbon's 25 de Abril Bridge and make travel smoother between the north and south of Portugal. This cable-stayed bridge was designed to be earthquake and wind-resistant; its deck is not fixed to the pylons, and it can move both lengthwise and sideways. Its opening was perfectly timed for Expo 98, the World's Fair celebrating the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's historic sea route discovery from Europe to India.

The museum is 70 feet underground, beneath the memorial's waterfall pools in the footprints of the fallen towers. The names of those who died in the 2001 terrorist attacks and in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing are listed on bronze parapets surrounding these huge reflecting pools. Seven stories below the memorial, the museum tells the story of 9/11 through exhibits, artifacts, historical records, and personal accounts, remembering the victims and those who risked their lives to save others.

Dolphins are highly intelligent and can be found all over the world in oceans, rivers, and estuaries. But they are threatened by human activities, such as hunting, pollution, and fishing. Hunting in particular led to the creation of World Dolphin Day in 2022 by Sea Shepherd Global, an international marine conservation group.

Marine wildlife found year-round in Réunion's deeper waters include many types of sharks, orcas, humpback whales, sea turtles, and dolphins. The island's warm, tropical climate is ideal for these creatures, as well as spinner, bottlenose, and rough-toothed dolphins, which also swim in the island's crystal-clear waters.

These marsupials, smaller cousins of the kangaroo, are native to Australia and New Guinea. There are around 30 species of wallabies, including swamp, rock, and hare-wallabies. These sprightly mammals have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and deliver powerful kicks if threatened. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts in an attempt to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs' for safety and mutual grooming. Their playgrounds are forests that echo with the thudding of their hops as they navigate their home range.

<summary>Description</summary>

> For many Asian cultures, the point at which the moon reaches its fullest during the harvest season marks the Mid-Autumn Festival, also known as the Moon Festival. It's traditionally observed on the 15th day of the eighth month in the Chinese lunar calendar. Dating back more than 3,000 years to China's Shang Dynasty, this festival celebrates moon watching and the end of the harvest season. During the festivities, mooncakes—round delicacies filled with sweet bean paste, salted egg yolks, or lotus seeds—are often shared among friends and family. Lanterns of different shapes, sizes, and hues, symbolizing good fortune, illuminate the night. Asian communities across the world come together to showcase a mélange of cultural performances, heartfelt renditions of the Moon Festival's poetic tales.

> As depicted in today's image, Gardens by the Bay in Singapore has been transformed into a mystical realm during this event. The Supertree Grove comes alive with radiant lantern displays, and the park's conservatories host themed shows, often inspired by myths or nature's wonders.
