> 今年是约塞米蒂国家公园遗产的又一个里程碑。约塞米蒂国家公园自1864年以来一直受到保护，以其令人惊叹的壮丽景色和生态意义而闻名。约塞米蒂坐落在内华达山脉的中心地带，占地近1200平方英里，孕育着巨大的花岗岩、奔腾的瀑布和古老的红杉。克拉克山脉是其鲜为人知的瑰宝之一——今天照片中显示的崎岖高海拔山脊。它以约塞米蒂的第一位守护者、自然保护先驱盖伦·克拉克的名字命名。

> This year marks another milestone in the legacy of Yosemite National Park, a sanctuary protected since 1864 and celebrated for its awe-inspiring grandeur and ecological significance. Nestled in the heart of the Sierra Nevada, Yosemite's nearly 1,200 square miles cradle granite giants, cascading waterfalls, and ancient sequoias. Among its lesser-known treasures lies the Clark Range—the rugged, high-elevation spine seen in today's image. It was named after Galen Clark, Yosemite's first guardian and a pioneer of conservation.
> 
> The Clark Range stands as a quiet sentinel to Yosemite's southern wilderness, its peaks etched by glaciers and crowned with alpine meadows. Here, the wind whispers through whitebark pines and the sky opens wide, echoing the spirit of foresight that birthed the park.
> 
> As we honor Yosemite's anniversary, we celebrate not only its grandeur but the enduring vision of those who fought to preserve it. From the valley's granite walls to the Clark Range's serene heights, this national park remains a living poem—written in stone, water, and time.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Beyond water, rivers carry life, history, and stories. They are nature's ever-moving contribution to our landscapes, flowing through lands and across time. One such gem is the Snake River, which winds through Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. A particularly stunning spot along this river is Oxbow Bend—featured in today's image—where calm waters reflect the towering Teton Range, and wildlife such as moose and bald eagles thrive. Here, water flows freely, unbound by concrete or commerce, protected by the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, signed on this day in 1968.
> 
> This landmark law is a promise: that some rivers shall run wild forever. It safeguards waters with 'outstandingly remarkable' beauty, ecology, and spirit—rivers that sing of wilderness and whisper of heritage. The Snake River Headwaters, including Oxbow Bend, joined this sacred list in 2009, ensuring its reflections remain undisturbed and its rhythms unbroken.
> 
> At dawn, mist dances over the bend, and the mountains blush with the first light. Visitors pause, hushed by nature's poetry. Thanks to this Act, the river's story flows on—untamed, unspoiled, unforgettable.
