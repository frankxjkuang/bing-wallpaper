> This year marks another milestone in the legacy of Yosemite National Park, a sanctuary protected since 1864 and celebrated for its awe-inspiring grandeur and ecological significance. Nestled in the heart of the Sierra Nevada, Yosemite's nearly 1,200 square miles cradle granite giants, cascading waterfalls, and ancient sequoias. Among its lesser-known treasures lies the Clark Range—the rugged, high-elevation spine seen in today's image. It was named after Galen Clark, Yosemite's first guardian and a pioneer of conservation.
> 
> The Clark Range stands as a quiet sentinel to Yosemite's southern wilderness, its peaks etched by glaciers and crowned with alpine meadows. Here, the wind whispers through whitebark pines and the sky opens wide, echoing the spirit of foresight that birthed the park.
> 
> As we honor Yosemite's anniversary, we celebrate not only its grandeur but the enduring vision of those who fought to preserve it. From the valley's granite walls to the Clark Range's serene heights, this national park remains a living poem—written in stone, water, and time.

> Beyond water, rivers carry life, history, and stories. They are nature's ever-moving contribution to our landscapes, flowing through lands and across time. One such gem is the Snake River, which winds through Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. A particularly stunning spot along this river is Oxbow Bend—featured in today's image—where calm waters reflect the towering Teton Range, and wildlife such as moose and bald eagles thrive. Here, water flows freely, unbound by concrete or commerce, protected by the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, signed on this day in 1968.
> 
> This landmark law is a promise: that some rivers shall run wild forever. It safeguards waters with 'outstandingly remarkable' beauty, ecology, and spirit—rivers that sing of wilderness and whisper of heritage. The Snake River Headwaters, including Oxbow Bend, joined this sacred list in 2009, ensuring its reflections remain undisturbed and its rhythms unbroken.
> 
> At dawn, mist dances over the bend, and the mountains blush with the first light. Visitors pause, hushed by nature's poetry. Thanks to this Act, the river's story flows on—untamed, unspoiled, unforgettable.

> Mists curl, waters glimmer, and legends linger—welcome to Glen Brittle. On the Isle of Skye, Scotland's fabled 'Misty Isle,' the glen stretches in a sweep of purple heather carpeting its rugged slopes. The landscape hums with echoes of the past: dinosaurs left footprints on these cliffs long before Mesolithic hunters traced its streams over 8,000 years ago. In the 9th century, seafaring Norse Vikings settled here. Centuries later, the powerful MacLeod and MacDonald clans claimed these lands, their castles standing guard over countless battles and alliances.
> 
> Among the hills and hidden lochs, the Fairy Pools shimmer in emerald and turquoise, tumbling over volcanic rock—a place where, according to local tales, fairies once danced under the moonlight. Nearby, Loch Coruisk, the 'Cauldron of Waters,' tucked beneath the jagged Black Cuillin peaks, is said to be haunted by a kelpie, a shape-shifting water spirit. Red deer glide silently through the heather, rabbits vanish along secret trails, and golden eagles wheel above. Glen Brittle is where geology, wildlife, and human history intertwine. Every stone, waterfall, and valley tells a story—step softly and listen closely.

> From October 4 to 10, World Space Week invites us to transcend our earthly bounds and chase the stars. It was born from the launch of Sputnik 1 by the USSR in 1957 and the signing of the Outer Space Treaty in 1967, a pioneering international commitment to peaceful cosmic exploration. During this week, classrooms buzz with experiments, planetariums echo with wonder, and telescopes bridge the gap to distant galaxies. Together, these moments weave a universal story of science, discovery, and humanity's relentless drive to push boundaries. The week's mission is clear: to ignite the next generation of explorers, engineers, and dreamers ready to rewrite the cosmos.
> 
> Today's image captures the International Space Station, a vast laboratory built by 15 nations, orbiting about 260 miles above Earth. Its solar arrays soak up sunlight to power groundbreaking research on microgravity, technology, and human survival beyond our planet. Shot from the SpaceX Crew Dragon Endeavour—a reusable spacecraft that has completed six missions since 2020, ferrying astronauts and cargo—this scene embodies what humanity can achieve when it chooses cooperation over competition. Each gleaming panel makes it clear: the final frontier is within reach, and the audacity to explore it defines us.

> The tradition of teaching is deeply rooted in human history. Today, we honor those who dedicate their lives to sharing knowledge and shaping minds. Happy World Teachers' Day to all the educators who have helped us become who we are.
> 
> From Confucius in ancient China to Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle in ancient Greece, and Maria Montessori in 20th-century Italy, teachers have not only shaped lives—they've shaped history. Many cultural icons once stood at the front of a classroom. Did you know that Stephen King, for instance, taught English before becoming a bestselling author?
> 
> Teachers are essential pillars of a thriving society. Recognizing this, UNESCO and the International Labour Organization established October 5 as World Teachers' Day in 1994 to celebrate and support educators worldwide. As a tribute to wisdom, today's image features a boreal owl. The owl has long symbolized intelligence and insight. One of the earliest associations comes from Greek mythology: the goddess of wisdom, Athena, was often depicted with a small owl, her sacred animal. This nocturnal companion came to represent clarity, perception, and the ability to see beyond the surface.

> The shiver felt under a full autumn moon, when the air hints at winter's arrival, has a way of lingering in memory. One of China's most cherished holidays, the Mid-Autumn Festival—also known as the Moon Festival—adds another touch of magic to the end of the harvest season. It's celebrated on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month of the Chinese calendar—this year, on October 6. According to legend, it's also the night when the moon goddess Chang'e watches over the world.

> Families gather to share mooncakes—round pastries filled with sweet or savory goodness—and enjoy lanterns, moon gazing, and heartfelt reunions. One of the most enchanting sights is the Anshun Bridge in Chengdu, China—seen in today's image—glowing in golden light to honor the festival. Its arches reflect in the Jin River, creating a dreamy scene. In the United States, communities with Asian heritage celebrate with lantern parades, mooncake tastings, and cultural gatherings in cities like San Francisco, New York, and Dallas. Tonight, let the light guide you to the moon and back.

> It's that time of year when the hills shed their summer greens, unveiling a blaze of colors that lights up the season. The change usually begins in September and early October, with higher slopes turning first, followed by the lower valleys. Among the stars of this display are the aspens, whose leaves shimmer like gold coins in the sunlight. The magic of aspen colors, however, isn't guaranteed year after year. Their golden glow depends on many factors—tree health, local weather shifts, soil moisture, and where they grow in terms of elevation and latitude. Healthy aspens are the true stars of the season: strong, thriving groves burst with brighter colors and hold onto their leaves longer, while stressed or weakened trees often fade quickly, offering only a glimpse of their usual brilliance. Today's image captures their full glow at the base of Mount Sneffels, the highest peak in Colorado's Sneffels Range, rising more than 7,000 feet above the town of Ridgway.

On World Octopus Day, as we reflect on their brilliance, we're reminded that even these ocean geniuses can't outsmart threats like climate change and pollution. Protecting their homes means safeguarding the future of our seas.
> 
> Meet the master of disguise—the day octopus (Octopus cyanea). Found across the Pacific and Indian Oceans, from Hawaii to Africa's eastern coast, this reef-dweller is a true shapeshifter. Unlike most of its kin, it hunts in broad daylight, instantly shifting its color, pattern, and even skin texture to blend into its surroundings. At times, it even performs a clever 'passing clouds' act, casting a false shadow to trick crabs into moving at just the wrong moment. And once the trap is sprung, the hunter wastes no time. A skilled predator, this octopus prowls the reef for fish, crabs, shrimp, and mollusks. Smaller catches are devoured on the spot, while larger prey is dragged back to its den.

> Some dates mark a single milestone—Fiji's October 10 marks two. On that day in 1874, the islands officially became a British colony. Almost a century later, in 1970, the same date saw Fiji raise its own flag and declare independence. Fiji Day is a unique national holiday—part reflection, part celebration. The day begins with formal ceremonies, where the Fijian flag is hoisted and leaders deliver speeches. Schools and community groups often stage reenactments and performances. Streets fill with parades, villages host cultural dances like the meke, and rugby pitches come alive with matches. Families prepare traditional dishes like lovo, where meat and root crops are cooked underground, and kokoda, a citrus-marinated fish dish.

> Today, the spirit of freedom stretches from bustling towns to remote gems like the island of Monuriki, pictured here. Known worldwide as the filming site of 'Cast Away,' the island is uninhabited—but far from lifeless.

> Birds don't bother with passports, visas, or luggage—they just spread their wings and go. Twice a year, billions of migratory birds crisscross the globe, flying thousands of miles between breeding and wintering grounds. That epic commute is exactly what World Migratory Bird Day highlights. From the Arctic tern, which logs about 44,000 miles a year, to the tiny ruby-throated hummingbird crossing the Gulf of Mexico in a single flight, these seasonal fliers show what endurance really looks like. Observed on the second Saturday in May and October, the day also draws attention to the challenges migratory birds face: habitat loss, climate change, and light pollution can all disrupt their routes.
> 
> Among the travelers worth spotlighting is the wood duck, pictured here. This North American species has made quite a comeback after once facing steep population declines due to hunting and habitat loss. Thanks to conservation efforts and nest box programs, they are now a regular sight in wooded swamps, marshes, and lakes. While some wood ducks stay put year-round in the southern United States, northern hens migrate south when the chill sets in, heading for milder regions stretching from the southern states to Mexico.

Despite its name, this village isn't directly on the Saranac Lakes themselves but rather on Lake Flower, a wide section of the Saranac River. For centuries, the area—nicknamed 'The Capital of the Adirondacks'—was used by Indigenous peoples for hunting and travel. By the late 19th century, it gained fame as a health retreat, where Dr. Edward Livingston Trudeau pioneered fresh-air treatment for tuberculosis. The cure cottages from that era still stand today.

The village also boasts a lively arts scene, with galleries, music, and community festivals making culture as central as the outdoors. Local shops and restaurants add flavor, serving everything from trout to craft beer. The annual Winter Carnival is a highlight, complete with an ice palace that looks like something out of a frosty fairy tale, proving this village knows how to make a cool impression—literally.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Ever wondered what it's like to live on a movie set? Oia is about as close as it gets, part of Greece's Santorini archipelago. This village has appeared in films like 'The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants' and 'Tomb Raider,' thanks to its Cycladic houses—cube-shaped homes with flat roofs—and cliffside views that feel almost unreal. Its unique architecture has roots in the late 19th century. Sailors and merchants carved houses right into the volcanic cliffs—cool in summer and warm in winter. The white-and-blue theme is also more than just for show: houses were painted with lime wash so rainwater would run off and be collected. Today, visitors wander its cobbled lanes, explore the Naval Maritime Museum, or climb to the ruins of Agios Nikolaos Castle for unforgettable sunsets.
> 
> Nicknamed the 'Eagle's Nest,' Oia overlooks the volcanic islets of Palia and Nea Kameni, as well as Therasia, which was physically connected to Santorini before the Minoan eruption. And Santorini itself? Think of it as a crown of rock around the sea, a half-sunken caldera shaped by the eruption of 1600 BCE, one of the largest volcanic eruptions in human history.

<summary>Description</summary>

> 想象一只能在森林中悄然隐去的猫科动物——这就是欧亚猞猁。它耳尖上的簇毛和锐利的目光令人过目难忘。作为四种猞猁中体型最大的一种，它体长可达42 英寸，肩高可达30英寸，身形矫健，兼具力量与敏捷。厚实的脚掌不仅能帮助它悄无声息地移动，还像雪鞋一样分散体重，使其能在厚厚的积雪中追逐猎物。它大多在夜间出没，白天则隐匿在灌木丛或岩石洞穴中，夜幕降临才悄然出击，捕猎鹿、野兔和松鼠。
> 
> 猞猁过着独居生活。雄性和雌性各自占据自己的领地，并通过抓痕和气味标记来宣示主权，就像在森林中留下的秘密讯号。然而，它们神秘的天性并未能保护它们免遭人类的威胁。在20世纪70至80年代，成千上万张猞猁皮从俄罗斯和中国出口，使其数量一度降至危险水平。尽管毛皮贸易限制减轻了压力，但偷猎、栖息地丧失以及猎物减少等问题至今仍对欧亚猞猁构成生存危机。

<summary>Description</summary>

> Think of a cat that can vanish into the forest without a sound—that's the Eurasian lynx. With its tufted ears and a piercing gaze, this feline is the largest of the four lynx species. Stretching up to 42 inches in length and standing as tall as 30 inches at the shoulder, the Eurasian lynx is built for power and precision. Its padded paws aren't just for sneaking; they act like snowshoes, spreading its weight so it can chase down prey in deep winter drifts. Mostly a nocturnal hunter, it spends its days tucked away in thickets or rocky dens, venturing out under the cover of darkness to stalk deer, hares, and squirrels.
> 
> The lynx lives a solitary life. Males and females carve out their own territories, marking them with scratches and scent—like secret notes left in the forest. Their elusive nature did not protect them from humans: during the 1970s and '80s, thousands of lynx pelts were exported from Russia and China, pushing populations toward dangerous lows. Though fur trade restrictions have eased the pressure, poaching, habitat loss, and shrinking prey numbers still pose threats today.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Nestled within Michigan's Rock River Canyon Wilderness, Rock River Falls emerges amid a landscape shaped by glaciers, dense woods, and layers of history. In the Upper Peninsula, humans have left their traces for millennia: Indigenous Algonquian-speaking peoples were followed by French and British explorers, and waves of Finnish, Swedish, and French-Canadian immigrants settled there during the 19th-century mining and logging booms. Today, this sparsely populated region hosts barely 3% of Michigan's residents, cradling its forests and waterfalls in near-natural serenity.
> 
> Reaching the falls requires a moderately challenging hike along winding paths lined with towering pines and maples, their shade cooling the ferns and wildflowers below. Red squirrels dart, white-tailed deer move silently, and the calls of loons and pileated woodpeckers echo through the Hiawatha National Forest. At the trail's end, the 18-foot waterfall spills into a clear pool, transformed by seasonal shifts: summer light flickers across the water, autumn sets the canopy ablaze, and winter drapes ice over rocks in glistening formations. At Rock River Falls, each visit offers a fresh sensory journey through the wild soul of northern Michigan.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In Minnesota, autumn carries more than crimson leaves—it brings the crisp promise of apple season. From mid-August through late October, orchards across the state open their rows of Honeycrisp, Haralson, and dozens of other cultivars, each bred for flavor, resilience, and charm. Today's image captures that moment: branches heavy with ripe fruit, ready for harvest.
> 
> This land takes its apples seriously. The state apple, the Honeycrisp, now a world favorite, was born in the orchards of the University of Minnesota, where scientists have been cultivating apples for over a century. Throughout the fall, families flock to orchards not only for the fruit but also for hayrides, cider pressing, and the yearly ritual of choosing the perfect apple right from the tree.
> 
> Behind the simple joy lies rigorous cultivation science: here, apple breeding has shaped varieties tough enough for harsh winters and sweet enough to rival any grown elsewhere. There are more than 7,500 cultivars worldwide. Among them, Minnesota's contribution is distinctive—proof that innovation and tradition can flourish side by side, season after season.

> How good would it feel if you could just hang out and do absolutely nothing all day? That's exactly what sloths do, and today, we celebrate them. International Sloth Day honors these unhurried creatures and reminds us that life doesn't always need to be rushed. Sloths are tree-dwelling mammals native to Central and South America. Their deliberate movements conserve energy, avoid predators, and even allow algae to grow on their fur, creating green camouflage among the canopy. Hoffmann's two-toed sloth, pictured here, is a prime example of the slow-paced lifestyle typical of all sloths. It spends most of its time in the trees, occasionally descending to the ground to move to a new one.
> 
> Beyond their charm, sloths play a crucial role in tropical forests. Their presence signals a healthy ecosystem, and protecting their habitats benefits various other species, including frogs and birds. Yet these gentle creatures face growing threats due to rainforest degradation. Organizations like the Sloth Conservation Foundation are working tirelessly to develop initiatives to preserve their habitats, ensuring that future generations can continue to marvel at these slow-moving icons of nature.

> Diwali is a vibrant Hindu festival celebrating hope, prosperity, and the triumph of good over evil. It commemorates Prince Rama's victorious return to the kingdom of Ayodhya after defeating the demon king Ravana. The festival also honors the goddess Lakshmi, who is believed to bring wealth and well-being into homes, while some communities worship the goddess Kali. During Diwali, families clean and decorate their homes, exchange sweets, and gather for prayers, creating an atmosphere of joy. Central to the celebration are diyas, small oil lamps whose glowing flames symbolize light overcoming darkness and the promise of new beginnings.

> In Bulgaria, on the western slopes of the Balkan Mountains, the Belogradchik Rocks stand like a natural gallery where every formation tells a tale. Shaped over millions of years by erosion, these sandstone and limestone pillars twist and tower into outlines that locals swear resemble people, animals, and even entire scenes. That's why names like 'The Horseman,' 'The Schoolgirl,' and 'The Monks' have stuck—it's a landscape where spotting shapes feels a bit like playing nature's version of charades.
> 
> The rocks, which are on UNESCO's Tentative List, stretch for more than 18 miles around the town of Belogradchik, their colors shifting from deep red to gold depending on the light. History found a use for them, too. The Belogradchik Fortress, first built by the Romans and later reinforced by Ottomans, leans on the rocks as natural defense. Why build walls when the mountain has already done the heavy lifting? Visitors today come to hike, climb, and photograph the unusual shapes, but they often leave with something extra: stories. The Belogradchik Rocks aren't just formations—they're legends frozen in stone.

> Ever tried spotting a snow leopard in the wild? It's called the 'ghost of the mountains' for a reason—you're more likely to see its pawprints than the big cat itself. But every October 23, the species steps into the spotlight on International Day of the Snow Leopard, a day set aside to protect this elusive predator and its rugged home.
> 
> Snow leopards roam high-altitude ranges across 12 Asian countries, from Afghanistan to China. Their thick coats and long tails are built for survival in freezing, rocky terrain. Yet even these stealthy cats can't hide from threats like poaching, shrinking habitats, and climate change. With fewer than 7,000 left in the wild, conservation is a necessity. The image of a snow leopard mother sheltering her cubs in the rocky cliffs of the Cold Desert Biosphere Reserve in India illustrates what's at stake. That's why governments, conservation groups, and local communities team up to safeguard both the animals and their ecosystems. After all, saving snow leopards also protects water sources and biodiversity for millions of people living downstream: they act as keystone species in their alpine environment, maintaining the ecological balance through predation on herbivores. That prevents overgrazing and protects vegetation that helps retain snowmelt and maintain watershed health.

> She was never meant to fade away. When the RMS Queen Mary sailed in 1936, she stole the spotlight across the Atlantic—an Art Deco liner that broke speed records and carried celebrities, royalty, and dignitaries. War transformed her from a floating palace into the 'Grey Ghost,' stripped of luxury and loaded with Allied troops. In 1967, after 30 years at sea, she retired to Long Beach, where her decks now serve as hotel corridors, guided exhibits, and a living monument to maritime history.
> 
> But her legend did not dock with her anchors. Over the years, guests and crew have spoken of echoes in empty corridors, footsteps reverberating on metal floors, and the laughter of a child near the deserted pool. Ghost tours highlight these eerie stories, though historians note that deaths aboard were due to natural causes, with no murders ever recorded. Today, the Queen Mary stands as both a heritage landmark and a stage for folklore. So, is she haunted? There are no records confirming it, yet the whispers keep her stories very much alive.

This reserve is more than just mires—it carries layers of history. During Finland's Prohibition era (1919–1932), smugglers hauled sacks of liquor from Sweden across these bogs, following a 'spirits' route that passed through Martimoaapa. Parts of that path can still be traced today. Imagine trekking with a heavy pack over soggy ground—would you have made it?
> 
> This is just the beginning. Here, archaeologists have discovered brackish pits once used to store meat, and a mysterious stone circle about 33 feet wide—like something out of a northern myth. Its purpose? Still unknown. More recent history lives on in the Saunasaari sauna, once part of a logging cabin built for men who worked these boreal forests. It gave them warmth, rest, and a place to dry off.
> 
> Wildlife, ever-present, completes the picture. Nearly 100 bird species nest here, from swans and cranes to owls and kestrels. Trails ranging from 1.9 to 8 miles, dotted with huts and campfire sites, invite you to explore—on foot or on skis in winter.
