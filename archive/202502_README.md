> 又迎来了土拨鼠日。今天，美国和加拿大的人们依赖著名土拨鼠潘克苏托尼·菲尔预测冬季是否会持续。菲尔是世界上最著名的土拨鼠。传说2月2日它若从洞穴中出来看到影子，就会返回洞中继续冬眠，意味着冬天将持续六周；若看不到影子，则预示春天将提前到来。德国移民将这一习俗带到美国。1887年，宾夕法尼亚州潘克苏托尼首次举办土拨鼠日庆祝活动。历史上，欧洲人将这一天视为春天的开始。德国人最初通过观察獾和其他小动物的行为，判断农事重要的季节变化迹象。18至19世纪移居宾夕法尼亚的德国人，选择当地土拨鼠担任“天气预报员”的角色。

> It's Groundhog Day … again. Today, Americans and Canadians rely on the prognostication skills of Punxsutawney Phil to determine if winter will hang on. Phil is a famous groundhog, also known as a woodchuck, and legend has it that if he emerges from his burrow February 2 and sees his own shadow, he'll go back to sleep for another six weeks of winter. If he doesn't, it will be an early spring. German immigrants brought the custom to America, where it was first celebrated in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, in 1887. Historically, Europeans celebrated February 2 as the first day of spring, and Germans originally watched badgers and other small animals for signs of seasonal change important to farmers. The Germans who settled in Pennsylvania in the 18th and 19th centuries chose the area's native groundhog for this task.

> The alpine marmot in today's image is a close relative of the groundhog, which is another species of marmot. Marmots are the heaviest members of the squirrel family, and the alpine species is native to central and southern Europe. Its North American cousin, the groundhog, is a highly intelligent lowland rodent that forms intricate social networks, but it's a so-so weather forecaster.

> Being the 'black sheep' isn't always a bad thing—just ask the Scottish Blackface, seen here in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. With its striking dark features and a knack for thriving in places where others wouldn't, this British breed has turned the idiom on its head. Far from an outcast, it's the backbone of Scotland's rural life and a true champion of the hills and moors. Interestingly, the Blackface sheep didn't originate in Scotland but south of the Anglo-Scottish border.
> 
> The breed's history is fascinating, and varieties such as the large-framed Perth and the medium-framed Lanark types are found throughout the United Kingdom. Not only is it the most common breed in the UK, but the Blackface sheep has spread across the world, including to the US. Its coarse fleece is perfect for making durable products like carpets and tweeds—it's definitely not your average sweater material.

> What do you get when you bring together more than 500 Māori chiefs, representatives of the British Crown, and a treaty signed in 1840? A day that New Zealanders still commemorate: Waitangi Day. On this date, the Treaty of Waitangi was signed, establishing the principles for how the two cultures would coexist. Ceremonies are held at Waitangi Treaty Grounds—where the document was signed—featuring traditional Māori performances, speeches, and the ever-dramatic waka (canoe) races. From festivals and concerts in cities like Auckland and Wellington to low-key community gatherings, the spirit of the day is about connection and culture.

> In Norway, winter isn't just a season—it's an experience. In the north of the country, nights stretch for 20 hours, and there are entire weeks when the sun remains hidden below the horizon. It might sound bleak, but it's a unique time of the year. Why? Because around early afternoon, usually between 1 and 2 PM, a soft, lingering light reflects off the snow-covered ground and the deep blue sea. This forms a breathtaking, glassy blue glow that settles over the landscape. Each day, the blue hour arrives just a little later, a gentle reminder that the sun is slowly preparing to reclaim the sky.
> 
> Featured here is Trondheim's blue hour. The city lies on the southern shore of the Trondheimsfjord and is framed by the gentle curves of the Nidelva River. Founded in 997 CE as a trading post, Trondheim was Norway's capital during the Viking Age and remained so until 1217. While its coastal climate keeps winters relatively mild, Trondheim's nearby hills offer a colder, snowier microclimate perfect for winter sports enthusiasts.

> Winter turns Mestia's medieval towers into icy fortresses. Perched 4,921 feet up in the Caucasus Mountains, Mestia is a charming highland town in northwest Georgia. The town is home to the Svans, a cultural and linguistic subgroup of Georgians. Despite its modest size, Mestia has been an essential hub of Georgian culture for centuries, dotted with the Svan defensive towers, seen in today's image. Most of these towers were constructed between the 9th and 12th centuries, a period often referred to as Georgia's Golden Age. However, their roots are believed to stretch even further back, possibly into prehistoric times. Built for both protection and shelter, these towers were not just fortresses but also integral parts of family homes, reflecting the region's history of resilience and self-sufficiency. Therefore, it isn't just a town; it's a living museum where history rises from these towers and echoes through the mountains.

> Today, we celebrate Darwin Day—a shout-out to Charles Darwin and his game-changing ideas about life on Earth. As an English naturalist, geologist, and biologist, his theory of natural selection revolutionized our understanding of species, evolution, and our role in the natural world. His work, 'On the Origin of Species,' published in 1859, laid the foundation for modern evolutionary biology. This day marks the birthday of Darwin and honors his genius while promoting curiosity, science, and critical thinking.
> 
> Speaking of cool science, marine iguanas, found only on the Galápagos Islands, serve as an example of Darwin's evolutionary principles. These reptiles, seen in today's image, are the only lizards in the world that forage in the sea, diving to graze on algae growing on submerged rocks. They've developed in remarkable ways, acquiring flattened tails for swimming and salt glands that allow them to expel seawater by sneezing. During his visit to the islands in 1835, Darwin noted their appearance as being like 'imps of darkness' but also recognized how perfectly they were adapted to their harsh environment.

> At Lake Tyrrell, in southern Australia, the sky meets the Earth in a dazzling display. The state of Victoria's largest salt lake was formed around 120,000 years ago. Over time, climate changes caused water levels to drop; these days, the lake is normally dry, except in winter when it's covered in about 2 inches of water. The name 'Tyrrell' comes from the local Wergaia word for 'sky,' a nod to the Boorong Aboriginal People's interest in astronomy. Spanning more than 70 square miles, Lake Tyrrell is a haven for wildlife, including kangaroos, emus, and various reptiles.

> In recent years, the lake has become a tourist hotspot. People come from all over the world during the winter months, drawn by its mirror-like surface that reflects the endless Australian sky, making it the perfect photo op. Salt formations on the lakebed also provide a stunning backdrop for photographs. At night, it becomes the perfect place for stargazing, offering the chance to marvel at the constellations of the Southern Hemisphere.

The attraction is only open from mid-January through mid-February. Colored lights after dark create a scene that feels straight out of a winter fairy tale.
> 
> Just 2 hours from Tokyo, Chichibu is the perfect escape to enjoy nature's artistry and some fresh mountain air. Warm up after viewing the icicles with a soothing soak at the nearby Otaki Onsen, a popular hot spring, for relaxation. Since much of Chichibu sits in or near the Chichibu Tama Kai National Park, there’s abundant nature to see.

> On the third Sunday of February, World Whale Day highlights the beauty of whales and the challenges they face. This year, on February 16, we honor these majestic creatures, like the humpback whale pictured in today's image, known for its enchanting songs and dramatic breaches. World Whale Day began in 1980 in Maui, Hawaii, led by Greg Kauffman of the Pacific Whale Foundation, to protect humpbacks from extinction. Today, it urges global action on threats like ocean pollution, climate change, and habitat loss.
> 
> Humpbacks can grow up to 55 feet long and weigh as much as 40 tons. They travel nearly 10,000 miles annually, feeding in polar waters and breeding in warmer seas. Though their numbers have partially recovered, they still face challenges like fishing gear entanglement and ship collisions. This World Whale Day let's work to protect these ocean giants and preserve their habitats for future generations.

> Presidents' Day, celebrated on the third Monday in February, is a time for Americans to reflect on the legacies of those who have served in the country's highest office. The day is officially Washington's Birthday at the federal level, but it has evolved into a celebration that recognizes the achievements of all US presidents. Parades and patriotic displays are held across the country, and many people take the opportunity to learn about presidential history.
> 
> Today's image takes us to the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC. The figure of Abraham Lincoln, seated and contemplative, surrounded by inscriptions of his famous speeches, is a powerful reminder of his leadership and enduring legacy.

> The Great Blue Hole, found near the center of Lighthouse Reef off the coast of Belize, is one of nature's most incredible creations. The massive marine sinkhole, 1,043 feet across and 407 feet deep, was formed during the last ice age when a limestone cave system collapsed and rising sea levels flooded the area, leaving behind a striking natural wonder.
> 
> Made famous by explorer Jacques Cousteau in 1971, the Great Blue Hole is now one of the world's top scuba diving destinations. Divers flock here to see its aquamarine waters, stalactites, and diverse marine life, including nurse sharks, reef sharks, and giant groupers. Beyond a depth of 300 feet, a mysterious layer of hydrogen sulfide creates a lifeless, dark zone—an eerie yet fascinating feature. Whether you're an adventurer or a nature lover, the Great Blue Hole is a must-see marvel that displays the beauty and mystery of our planet.

> The European river otter is more than just an adorable face in the wild. Found across Europe, Asia, and parts of northern Africa, these otters thrive in clean rivers, lakes, and wetlands, serving as an important indicator of environmental health. They are built for agility, with streamlined bodies, webbed feet, and dense fur that keeps them warm even in icy waters. A single square inch of their fur can hold more than 400,000 hairs, making it one of nature's most effective insulators. River otters were once endangered due to pollution and habitat loss. Thanks to conservation efforts, their populations are rebounding in many regions across Europe.
> 
> Otters are naturally playful, often sliding down snowy or muddy banks and diving underwater to find pebbles to play with. They communicate using a repertoire of whistles, squeaks, and even scent, which also helps them mark their territorial boundaries. If you find yourself near a serene river in their range, keep an eye out—you might just spot one of these elusive river-dwellers.

> Born on this day in 1902, Ansel Adams remains one of the most celebrated photographers in history, renowned for his striking black-and-white images of the American wilderness. His work immortalized the grandeur of national parks like California's Yosemite, pictured here, showcasing the raw beauty of nature with depth and clarity. A pioneer of 'pure photography,' Adams believed in capturing a scene's natural essence without manipulation, a principle he championed through his development of the Zone System—a technique to control exposure and contrast.
> 
> Adams initially aspired to be a concert pianist, but his love for the outdoors—sparked by a family trip to Yosemite in 1916—set him on a path that would redefine landscape photography. Beyond his art, Adams was a passionate environmentalist. His work often served as visual arguments for the preservation of America's wild places. He also played a crucial role in expanding the National Park system, advocating for the establishment of Kings Canyon National Park in California. Adams' legacy continues to inspire photographers and environmentalists alike, reminding us of the power of art to drive change.

> From waterfalls to temples, Shivamogga, in the South Indian state of Karnataka, offers experiences waiting to be discovered. Steeped in timeless lore, the city is mentioned in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, epics composed as poems and set in the ancient Hindu kingdoms of India. The region's name itself holds a spiritual significance, derived from the Sanskrit words 'Shiva-Mukha,' meaning the 'face of Shiva,' the Hindu god. It is home to several temples, including the Sharavati Temple, dedicated to Shiva, and a temple in the Kodachadri hills that offers vistas of the Western Ghats mountain range.
> 
> Adding to this landscape is Champaka Sarasi, the monumental pond featured in today's image. It tells a story far beyond its waters. It was built by Venkatappa Nayaka, a member of the Nayakas of Keladi, an important ruling dynasty of early modern Karnataka. The pond was constructed in memory of the king's beloved wife, Champaka. It also has a small stone temple at its center, housing a Shiva linga, an abstract or non-figurative depiction of Shiva. Shivamogga is also renowned for its waterfalls, including Jog Falls, the second-highest plunge waterfall in India.

> Today we are celebrating the anniversary of Gateway National Park, which was established on February 22, 2018, in St. Louis, Missouri. The park, which lies along a picturesque stretch of the Mississippi River, commemorates Thomas Jefferson’s idea of a continental nation. At its heart stands the Gateway Arch, a breathtaking 630-foot-tall structure that has become the ultimate symbol of St. Louis. Constructed of stainless steel, it holds the distinction of being the world's tallest arch and Missouri's tallest accessible structure. Finnish American architect Eero Saarinen dreamed up the design back in 1947, and by October 28, 1965, his vision had been brought to life. The arch's futuristic design has long been viewed as a symbol of the automobile era, representing the modern, urban landscape, and the promise of a technologically advanced future.

> Around 60 miles southwest of Tokyo stands one of Japan's cultural icons: Mount Fuji. The country's tallest mountain rises 12,000 feet above the surrounding landscape, with its near-symmetrical cone covered in snow for nearly five months each year. For centuries, Fujisan—as it is known in Japanese—has been worshiped as a sacred mountain. In the Shinto faith, Fuji is deified as Asama no Okami, and shrines dedicated to it are built within sight of the mountain.

> February 23 is celebrated as Mount Fuji Day (富士山の日) because the word 'Fujisan' can be interpreted as '2, 2, 3.' Although it's not a national holiday, people often take the opportunity to learn more about this majestic peak. It's also a day to reflect on the future of the mountain, and how it can be preserved for future generations. Every year, more than 300,000 people climb Mount Fuji, and overtourism has become a real concern.

People have lived in this area for at least 10,000 years, including the Anasazi, Pueblo, and Paiute Peoples. The hoodoos—tall, thin spires of rock formed by erosion—in the park inspired Paiute mythology: they believed them to be the Legend People turned to stone by the trickster Coyote.

> The first European Americans arrived in the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and some eventually settled there in the 1850s. Bryce Canyon was named after Ebenezer Bryce, who had a homestead nearby. On this date in 1928, it was declared a national park. These days, the park is famous for its hoodoos. Every year, over 2 million visitors come to marvel at these geological formations. In fact, Bryce Canyon National Park has the highest concentration of hoodoos anywhere on Earth.

Built around the 1440s by the Stewarts of Appin, its history includes royal visits and even a drunken wager that briefly transferred ownership to Clan Campbell. After falling into disrepair by the 19th century, it was lovingly restored in the mid-20th century and is still privately owned today. Visitors can explore this historic site on selected guided tours during the summer.

> Its name, 'Stalker,' comes from the Scottish Gaelic 'Stalcaire,' meaning 'hunter' or 'falconer.' And while its striking appearance is certainly memorable, its fame may actually stem from another reason: Castle Stalker has captured imaginations in popular culture, appearing in 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' and the 'Black Mirror' episode 'Loch Henry.' Does it ring a bell now? Nestled in the scenic Lynn of Lorn National Scenic Area, it's an enduring symbol of Scotland's storied past.

> Today we're heading north for International Polar Bear Day. This event is the perfect time to learn more about the world's largest bear species and the threats they face. Polar bears are native to the Arctic and can be found in Alaska, Russia, Greenland, and Svalbard. They're also found in Canada—like the cub in today's image, photographed in Churchill, Manitoba.
> 
> Polar bears spend over half of their time hunting for seals on the sea ice, although they usually catch just one or two for every 10 that they try to catch. Their reliance on sea ice for hunting means that they are highly vulnerable to climate change. Sea ice is rapidly disappearing as the planet heats up, and polar bears are at risk of malnutrition and starvation as their hunting grounds vanish. Shrinking ice sheets also mean that these bears have to swim farther to find food, which depletes their energy reserves. International Polar Bear Day is the perfect opportunity to reflect on how we can reduce our carbon footprints and contribute to the conservation of these amazing predators.
