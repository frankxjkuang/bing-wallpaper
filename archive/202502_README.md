> 又迎来了土拨鼠日。今天，美国和加拿大的人们依赖著名土拨鼠潘克苏托尼·菲尔预测冬季是否会持续。菲尔是世界上最著名的土拨鼠。传说2月2日它若从洞穴中出来看到影子，就会返回洞中继续冬眠，意味着冬天将持续六周；若看不到影子，则预示春天将提前到来。德国移民将这一习俗带到美国。1887年，宾夕法尼亚州潘克苏托尼首次举办土拨鼠日庆祝活动。历史上，欧洲人将这一天视为春天的开始。德国人最初通过观察獾和其他小动物的行为，判断农事重要的季节变化迹象。18至19世纪移居宾夕法尼亚的德国人，选择当地土拨鼠担任“天气预报员”的角色。

> It's Groundhog Day … again. Today, Americans and Canadians rely on the prognostication skills of Punxsutawney Phil to determine if winter will hang on. Phil is a famous groundhog, also known as a woodchuck, and legend has it that if he emerges from his burrow February 2 and sees his own shadow, he'll go back to sleep for another six weeks of winter. If he doesn't, it will be an early spring. German immigrants brought the custom to America, where it was first celebrated in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, in 1887. Historically, Europeans celebrated February 2 as the first day of spring, and Germans originally watched badgers and other small animals for signs of seasonal change important to farmers. The Germans who settled in Pennsylvania in the 18th and 19th centuries chose the area's native groundhog for this task.

> The alpine marmot in today's image is a close relative of the groundhog, which is another species of marmot. Marmots are the heaviest members of the squirrel family, and the alpine species is native to central and southern Europe. Its North American cousin, the groundhog, is a highly intelligent lowland rodent that forms intricate social networks, but it's a so-so weather forecaster.

> Two colossal stone hands cradle a shimmering, golden walkway, as though the mountains themselves are offering it to the sky. This is Cầu Vàng, or the Golden Bridge, a pedestrian bridge in the misty mountains near Da Nang in central Vietnam. Opened in 2018, the bridge quickly became a global sensation, captivating travelers with its unique design and awe-inspiring setting.

Made from reinforced concrete and framed by hands crafted from steel mesh and fiberglass, the bridge creates an image of timeless strength amid modern ingenuity. Suspended around 3,200 feet above sea level, the walkway offers visitors a panoramic view of the verdant countryside.

> Being the 'black sheep' isn't always a bad thing—just ask the Scottish Blackface, seen here in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. With its striking dark features and a knack for thriving in places where others wouldn't, this British breed has turned the idiom on its head. Far from an outcast, it's the backbone of Scotland's rural life and a true champion of the hills and moors. Interestingly, the Blackface sheep didn't originate in Scotland but south of the Anglo-Scottish border.
> 
> The breed's history is fascinating, and varieties such as the large-framed Perth and the medium-framed Lanark types are found throughout the United Kingdom. Not only is it the most common breed in the UK, but the Blackface sheep has spread across the world, including to the US. Its coarse fleece is perfect for making durable products like carpets and tweeds—it's definitely not your average sweater material.

> What do you get when you bring together more than 500 Māori chiefs, representatives of the British Crown, and a treaty signed in 1840? A day that New Zealanders still commemorate: Waitangi Day. On this date, the Treaty of Waitangi was signed, establishing the principles for how the two cultures would coexist. Ceremonies are held at Waitangi Treaty Grounds—where the document was signed—featuring traditional Māori performances, speeches, and the ever-dramatic waka (canoe) races. From festivals and concerts in cities like Auckland and Wellington to low-key community gatherings, the spirit of the day is about connection and culture.
> 
> What's better than celebrating New Zealand's history on Waitangi Day? Doing it in a place that looks straight out of a postcard. Enter the Archway Islands, a group of four rock stacks at Wharariki Beach, as seen in today's image. Rising from the waters of the Tasman Sea, these rugged islets became well known around the world after they were featured in a Windows 10 desktop screensaver in 2015. At low tide, curious wanderers can explore caves and rock pools and often spot lounging seals.
