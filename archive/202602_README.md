> Some months arrive quietly, but February knocks on the door, flips on the spotlight, and says, 'Let's give credit where it's long overdue.' That's the spirit of Black History Month—a time to celebrate African American achievements, confront hard truths, and honor those who shaped the country. It began in 1926 when historian Carter G. Woodson launched Negro History Week. The week grew, spread through schools and communities, and by 1976 it officially expanded into a month.
> 
> February isn't only about icons like Martin Luther King Jr. or Rosa Parks—it also highlights stories that rarely made headlines. One example comes from World War II: in 1944, a US Army Signal Corps photograph captured Black military nurses arriving at the port of Greenock, Scotland. Their overseas service was historic, especially for nurses who had fought to serve beyond segregated bases at home.
> 
> Today, this month feels like a mix of classrooms, concerts, and community meetups. Museums curate exhibits, and schools highlight inventors, thinkers, and trailblazers who never made it into older textbooks. Modern voices also take center stage—scientists pushing boundaries, athletes rewriting records, artists reshaping culture, and entrepreneurs building what comes next.
