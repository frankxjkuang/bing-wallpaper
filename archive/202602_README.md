> Some months arrive quietly, but February knocks on the door, flips on the spotlight, and says, 'Let's give credit where it's long overdue.' That's the spirit of Black History Month—a time to celebrate African American achievements, confront hard truths, and honor those who shaped the country. It began in 1926 when historian Carter G. Woodson launched Negro History Week. The week grew, spread through schools and communities, and by 1976 it officially expanded into a month.
> 
> February isn't only about icons like Martin Luther King Jr. or Rosa Parks—it also highlights stories that rarely made headlines. One example comes from World War II: in 1944, a US Army Signal Corps photograph captured Black military nurses arriving at the port of Greenock, Scotland. Their overseas service was historic, especially for nurses who had fought to serve beyond segregated bases at home.
> 
> Today, this month feels like a mix of classrooms, concerts, and community meetups. Museums curate exhibits, and schools highlight inventors, thinkers, and trailblazers who never made it into older textbooks. Modern voices also take center stage—scientists pushing boundaries, athletes rewriting records, artists reshaping culture, and entrepreneurs building what comes next.

> Every February 2, the world turns its eyes to a furry little forecaster with a penchant for popping out of holes: the groundhog. Legend has it that if this pint-sized predictor sees its shadow, winter drags on for six more weeks. No shadow? Spring is just around the corner. It's a quirky tradition that turns a small rodent into a celebrity meteorologist.
> 
> Groundhog Day has its roots in an old European custom in which a hedgehog or badger would predict the weather. When German immigrants came to Pennsylvania, they passed the forecasting torch to the local rodents, giving rise to Punxsutawney Phil—the most famous groundhog of them all. Each year, thousands gather in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to witness Phil's prediction, while millions watch from home, hoping for an early spring.
> 
> Across the Atlantic, the idea of reading the seasons through wildlife has its own twist. In the Alps, people watch for Alpine marmots, seen in today's image. After a long winter nap, these mountain dwellers emerge from their burrows into the light, often signaling warmer days ahead. They never get an official 'shadow ceremony,' but their timing acts as nature's quiet calendar in high-altitude communities.

<summary>Description</summary>

> You know a place holds stories when geologists, filmmakers, and local folklore all claim it for different reasons. Lake Tahoe, straddling the border between California and Nevada, fits that bill perfectly. Formed during the Ice Age, the lake was shaped by faulting and glacial carving that created its deep basin. It is now one of the deepest freshwater lakes in the United States. For generations, the Washoe people lived around these clear waters, fishing and gathering seasonally. Centuries later, miners arrived, steamboats crossed the water, and Tahoe shifted from a resource hub to a year-round retreat.
> 
> Emerald Bay, seen in today's image, became one of its most photographed corners. Because the bay is shallower than the main lake, its water takes on a lighter hue. Beneath the surface rest old launches and barges, now preserved within Emerald Bay State Park. In the middle, Fannette Island rises with a small stone 'Tea House,’ a 1920s structure built by philanthropist Lora Knight, who also commissioned Vikingsholm nearby. And the story doesn't end here. Local stories mention 'Tahoe Tessie,' the lake's mythical creature. You never know—maybe you'll catch a ripple that makes you look twice.

> Picture this: it's 1955, a winter evening in Montgomery, Alabama. A seamstress heads home after work. The bus fills with other passengers. The driver demands she give up her seat. Rosa Parks wasn't trying to make waves, but her refusal set off a chain reaction that would propel the civil rights movement into a new phase. Raised in rural Alabama, she grew up under segregation and later worked with the NAACP as a secretary and investigator, gathering testimony of racial violence and discrimination. By the time she declined to move, she was already a committed activist.
> 
> Her arrest sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott, a coordinated 381-day protest that helped end bus segregation. Rosa Parks Day emerged decades later to honor her work. First celebrated in 1998 in Michigan, it is observed on different dates across states, tied either to her birthday or to the day of her arrest. As Parks' national impact grew, she earned various medals, awards, and the distinction of being the first woman to lie in honor at the US Capitol rotunda. The stained-glass painting of Parks at Shorter Community African Methodist Episcopal Church in Denver, pictured here today, serves as a glowing reminder of a legacy that still reaches far beyond Montgomery.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Xwejni Bay in Gozo, Malta, has a way of making everyday elements look like a quiet choreography between sea, stone, and sun. You can't help but pause and look closer, right? Centuries back, families began carving these limestone pans, shaping hundreds of basins that trap seawater with each wave. Once the water settles in, the sun's heat does the rest, slowly evaporating it into natural Mediterranean salt. Gozo became a salt-making hub because its limestone coast is easy to shape, and its warm, dry summers keep the crystallization process steady. The first crystals form around May, marking the beginning of the harvesting season. Workers rake the salt by hand, sweep it with brooms and brushes, gather it into small piles to dry for another day, then bag it and store it in the caves.
> 
> Visitors can walk right up to the pans along the shore but look out for 'no trespassing' signs. If you swing by in the summer, you might spot active raking and drying. Take a moment to enjoy the view, and before you head back, consider collecting a salty souvenir from one of the many gourmet shops around Malta.

> Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia doesn't ease you in—it erupts into view like a horizon made of light. It's the world's largest salt flat, stretching across roughly 4,000 square miles at nearly 12,000 feet above sea level. The landscape dramatically shifts with the seasons: when the rain arrives, the surface floods just enough to become an enormous mirror, so perfectly reflective that sky and ground melt into a single glowing plane.
> 
> Around the salar, the landscape turns surprisingly varied. Rock formations sculpted by wind and time rise from the desert like abstract artwork—twisted, towering shapes that look almost deliberate. Not far away, steaming hot springs offer a soothing contrast to the crisp high‑altitude air, creating warm pockets of calm in the middle of the wilderness.
> 
> The surrounding lagunas and mineral‑rich lakes burst with unexpected color, and flocks of flamingos add flashes of motion to the stillness. Scattered nearby, ghost towns from Bolivia's mining era sit quietly against the vast white expanse, recalling the region's history with an air of mystery.

> The island of Corfu, Greece, meets you at night with a quiet kind of intensity: stone facades catching warm lamplight, fortress walls rising in sharp outline, and narrow lanes unfolding like a lived-in labyrinth. The Old Town doesn't just look historic—it feels inhabited, shaped by centuries of shifting cultures and the slow rhythm of island life after dark.
> 
> Move beyond the historic center and Corfu shifts into a more dynamic landscape. Rugged rock formations edge the coastline, carved by wind and sea into dramatic shapes that catch the morning light. Forested hills roll toward turquoise bays and secluded coves, where the colors deepen and brighten throughout the day. In the interior, warm springs and mineral-rich waters offer a serene pause, tucked into pockets of green that feel removed from the bustle of the harbor.
> 
> Returning to Corfu's Old Town, the UNESCO-listed streets blend Venetian, French, and British influences into a uniquely Greek character—stone arcades, fortress walls, pastel buildings, and lively squares where cafés spill into narrow lanes. Together, Corfu's dramatic coastlines, natural springs, and storied Old Town create an island experience that transitions beautifully from quiet evenings to vivid, adventurous days.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The leopard cat is a small wild cat found across South, Southeast, and East Asia. Similar in size to a house cat but longer-legged and slenderer, it generally measures 15–30 inches long, with a tail about 7–12 inches. Depending on the region, adults weigh roughly 1–16 pounds. Their appearance varies widely: southern individuals tend to have warm golden coats, while those farther north often have pale gray fur that thickens for winter.
> 
> This species has several living subspecies, each adapted to its environment. These include the Bengal leopard cat found from India through Southeast Asia; the Javan, Sumatran, and Bornean leopard cats on the islands of Indonesia; and the Taiwan leopard cat. One of the most distinctive is seen in today's image: the Amur leopard cat, found in the Russian Far East, Manchuria, Korea, and nearby islands. It's larger and paler than its southern relatives, with features suited to cold, snowy forests.
> 
> Leopard cats are mostly nocturnal hunters, preying on rodents, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. They're adaptable too, living in forests, wetlands, mountains, and even agricultural landscapes across their wide range.

> Just southwest of Ibiza, Spain, lie the uninhabited islets of Es Vedrà and Es Vedranell. Part of a protected nature reserve, these dramatic rock formations are admired for their ecological value and visual impact. Es Vedrà rises around 1,300 feet straight from the sea, its sheer limestone cliffs resembling a mountain range. Nearby, the jagged outline of Es Vedranell has earned it the nickname 'sleeping dragon,' appearing to guard its larger sibling.
> 
> Despite their stark appearance, the islets support a surprisingly rich ecosystem, including native flora, marine birds, endemic species such as the Ibiza wall lizard, and numerous invertebrates adapted to the rocky terrain. This fragile biodiversity is one of the reasons public access is tightly restricted.
> 
> Es Vedrà is also steeped in legend. Often compared to the Bermuda Triangle, it is said to lie within a powerful magnetic zone, inspiring stories of faulty compasses and strange lights. In Greek mythology, the islet is linked to the Sirens who lured Odysseus, while others believe it to be a remnant of the lost city of Atlantis. Wild and enigmatic, Es Vedrà and Es Vedranell are the kind of places that stay with you long after you've left.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Death Valley National Park challenges first impressions. Spanning more than 3.4 million acres across California and Nevada, it is the largest national park in the contiguous United States. Across this vast expanse, salt flats, volcanic hills, sweeping sand dunes, and distant snowcapped peaks create a landscape shaped by time and extremes. From the soaring heights of Telescope Peak, which rises over 11,000 feet above the desert floor, to the depths of Badwater Basin, 282 feet below sea level, the park is a study in contrasts.
> 
> Rare rainstorms can trigger brief bursts of wildflowers across parts of the valley, while hidden oases sustain wildlife and more than 1,000 plant species thrive against the odds. At Badwater Basin, pictured here, the land sinks to its lowest point in North America. Its blinding white salt flats stretch to the horizon, fractured into geometric patterns that make each step feel surreal. Long before it earned its foreboding name in 1849, the Timbisha Shoshone people called this valley home.
> 
> Recognizing its unique landscapes, President Herbert Hoover designated Death Valley a national monument on this day in 1933. That protection expanded in 1994, when the California Desert Protection Act elevated it to national park status and more than doubled its size, ensuring the preservation of this extraordinary desert for generations to come.
