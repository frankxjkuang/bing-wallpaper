> Some months arrive quietly, but February knocks on the door, flips on the spotlight, and says, 'Let's give credit where it's long overdue.' That's the spirit of Black History Month—a time to celebrate African American achievements, confront hard truths, and honor those who shaped the country. It began in 1926 when historian Carter G. Woodson launched Negro History Week. The week grew, spread through schools and communities, and by 1976 it officially expanded into a month.
> 
> February isn't only about icons like Martin Luther King Jr. or Rosa Parks—it also highlights stories that rarely made headlines. One example comes from World War II: in 1944, a US Army Signal Corps photograph captured Black military nurses arriving at the port of Greenock, Scotland. Their overseas service was historic, especially for nurses who had fought to serve beyond segregated bases at home.
> 
> Today, this month feels like a mix of classrooms, concerts, and community meetups. Museums curate exhibits, and schools highlight inventors, thinkers, and trailblazers who never made it into older textbooks. Modern voices also take center stage—scientists pushing boundaries, athletes rewriting records, artists reshaping culture, and entrepreneurs building what comes next.

> Every February 2, the world turns its eyes to a furry little forecaster with a penchant for popping out of holes: the groundhog. Legend has it that if this pint-sized predictor sees its shadow, winter drags on for six more weeks. No shadow? Spring is just around the corner. It's a quirky tradition that turns a small rodent into a celebrity meteorologist.
> 
> Groundhog Day has its roots in an old European custom in which a hedgehog or badger would predict the weather. When German immigrants came to Pennsylvania, they passed the forecasting torch to the local rodents, giving rise to Punxsutawney Phil—the most famous groundhog of them all. Each year, thousands gather in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to witness Phil's prediction, while millions watch from home, hoping for an early spring.
> 
> Across the Atlantic, the idea of reading the seasons through wildlife has its own twist. In the Alps, people watch for Alpine marmots, seen in today's image. After a long winter nap, these mountain dwellers emerge from their burrows into the light, often signaling warmer days ahead. They never get an official 'shadow ceremony,' but their timing acts as nature's quiet calendar in high-altitude communities.
