> Some months arrive quietly, but February knocks on the door, flips on the spotlight, and says, 'Let's give credit where it's long overdue.' That's the spirit of Black History Month—a time to celebrate African American achievements, confront hard truths, and honor those who shaped the country. It began in 1926 when historian Carter G. Woodson launched Negro History Week. The week grew, spread through schools and communities, and by 1976 it officially expanded into a month.
> 
> February isn't only about icons like Martin Luther King Jr. or Rosa Parks—it also highlights stories that rarely made headlines. One example comes from World War II: in 1944, a US Army Signal Corps photograph captured Black military nurses arriving at the port of Greenock, Scotland. Their overseas service was historic, especially for nurses who had fought to serve beyond segregated bases at home.
> 
> Today, this month feels like a mix of classrooms, concerts, and community meetups. Museums curate exhibits, and schools highlight inventors, thinkers, and trailblazers who never made it into older textbooks. Modern voices also take center stage—scientists pushing boundaries, athletes rewriting records, artists reshaping culture, and entrepreneurs building what comes next.

> Every February 2, the world turns its eyes to a furry little forecaster with a penchant for popping out of holes: the groundhog. Legend has it that if this pint-sized predictor sees its shadow, winter drags on for six more weeks. No shadow? Spring is just around the corner. It's a quirky tradition that turns a small rodent into a celebrity meteorologist.
> 
> Groundhog Day has its roots in an old European custom in which a hedgehog or badger would predict the weather. When German immigrants came to Pennsylvania, they passed the forecasting torch to the local rodents, giving rise to Punxsutawney Phil—the most famous groundhog of them all. Each year, thousands gather in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to witness Phil's prediction, while millions watch from home, hoping for an early spring.
> 
> Across the Atlantic, the idea of reading the seasons through wildlife has its own twist. In the Alps, people watch for Alpine marmots, seen in today's image. After a long winter nap, these mountain dwellers emerge from their burrows into the light, often signaling warmer days ahead. They never get an official 'shadow ceremony,' but their timing acts as nature's quiet calendar in high-altitude communities.

<summary>Description</summary>

> You know a place holds stories when geologists, filmmakers, and local folklore all claim it for different reasons. Lake Tahoe, straddling the border between California and Nevada, fits that bill perfectly. Formed during the Ice Age, the lake was shaped by faulting and glacial carving that created its deep basin. It is now one of the deepest freshwater lakes in the United States. For generations, the Washoe people lived around these clear waters, fishing and gathering seasonally. Centuries later, miners arrived, steamboats crossed the water, and Tahoe shifted from a resource hub to a year-round retreat.
> 
> Emerald Bay, seen in today's image, became one of its most photographed corners. Because the bay is shallower than the main lake, its water takes on a lighter hue. Beneath the surface rest old launches and barges, now preserved within Emerald Bay State Park. In the middle, Fannette Island rises with a small stone 'Tea House,’ a 1920s structure built by philanthropist Lora Knight, who also commissioned Vikingsholm nearby. And the story doesn't end here. Local stories mention 'Tahoe Tessie,' the lake's mythical creature. You never know—maybe you'll catch a ripple that makes you look twice.

> Picture this: it's 1955, a winter evening in Montgomery, Alabama. A seamstress heads home after work. The bus fills with other passengers. The driver demands she give up her seat. Rosa Parks wasn't trying to make waves, but her refusal set off a chain reaction that would propel the civil rights movement into a new phase. Raised in rural Alabama, she grew up under segregation and later worked with the NAACP as a secretary and investigator, gathering testimony of racial violence and discrimination. By the time she declined to move, she was already a committed activist.
> 
> Her arrest sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott, a coordinated 381-day protest that helped end bus segregation. Rosa Parks Day emerged decades later to honor her work. First celebrated in 1998 in Michigan, it is observed on different dates across states, tied either to her birthday or to the day of her arrest. As Parks' national impact grew, she earned various medals, awards, and the distinction of being the first woman to lie in honor at the US Capitol rotunda. The stained-glass painting of Parks at Shorter Community African Methodist Episcopal Church in Denver, pictured here today, serves as a glowing reminder of a legacy that still reaches far beyond Montgomery.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Xwejni Bay in Gozo, Malta, has a way of making everyday elements look like a quiet choreography between sea, stone, and sun. You can't help but pause and look closer, right? Centuries back, families began carving these limestone pans, shaping hundreds of basins that trap seawater with each wave. Once the water settles in, the sun's heat does the rest, slowly evaporating it into natural Mediterranean salt. Gozo became a salt-making hub because its limestone coast is easy to shape, and its warm, dry summers keep the crystallization process steady. The first crystals form around May, marking the beginning of the harvesting season. Workers rake the salt by hand, sweep it with brooms and brushes, gather it into small piles to dry for another day, then bag it and store it in the caves.
> 
> Visitors can walk right up to the pans along the shore but look out for 'no trespassing' signs. If you swing by in the summer, you might spot active raking and drying. Take a moment to enjoy the view, and before you head back, consider collecting a salty souvenir from one of the many gourmet shops around Malta.

> Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia doesn't ease you in—it erupts into view like a horizon made of light. It's the world's largest salt flat, stretching across roughly 4,000 square miles at nearly 12,000 feet above sea level. The landscape dramatically shifts with the seasons: when the rain arrives, the surface floods just enough to become an enormous mirror, so perfectly reflective that sky and ground melt into a single glowing plane.
> 
> Around the salar, the landscape turns surprisingly varied. Rock formations sculpted by wind and time rise from the desert like abstract artwork—twisted, towering shapes that look almost deliberate. Not far away, steaming hot springs offer a soothing contrast to the crisp high‑altitude air, creating warm pockets of calm in the middle of the wilderness.
> 
> The surrounding lagunas and mineral‑rich lakes burst with unexpected color, and flocks of flamingos add flashes of motion to the stillness. Scattered nearby, ghost towns from Bolivia's mining era sit quietly against the vast white expanse, recalling the region's history with an air of mystery.

> The leopard cat is a small wild cat found across South, Southeast, and East Asia. Similar in size to a house cat but longer-legged and slenderer, it generally measures 15–30 inches long, with a tail about 7–12 inches. Depending on the region, adults weigh roughly 1–16 pounds. Their appearance varies widely: southern individuals tend to have warm golden coats, while those farther north often have pale gray fur that thickens for winter.
> 
> This species has several living subspecies, each adapted to its environment. These include the Bengal leopard cat found from India through Southeast Asia; the Javan, Sumatran, and Bornean leopard cats on the islands of Indonesia; and the Taiwan leopard cat. One of the most distinctive is seen in today's image: the Amur leopard cat, found in the Russian Far East, Manchuria, Korea, and nearby islands. It's larger and paler than its southern relatives, with features suited to cold, snowy forests.
> 
> Leopard cats are mostly nocturnal hunters, preying on rodents, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. They're adaptable too, living in forests, wetlands, mountains, and even agricultural landscapes across their wide range.

Part of a protected nature reserve, these dramatic rock formations are admired for their ecological value and visual impact. Es Vedrà rises around 1,300 feet straight from the sea, its sheer limestone cliffs resembling a mountain range. Nearby, the jagged outline of Es Vedranell has earned it the nickname 'sleeping dragon,' appearing to guard its larger sibling.

This fragile biodiversity is one of the reasons public access is tightly restricted.
> 
> Es Vedrà is also steeped in legend. Often compared to the Bermuda Triangle, it is said to lie within a powerful magnetic zone, inspiring stories of faulty compasses and strange lights. In Greek mythology, the islet is linked to the Sirens who lured Odysseus, while others believe it to be a remnant of the lost city of Atlantis.

> Death Valley National Park challenges first impressions. Spanning more than 3.4 million acres across California and Nevada, it is the largest national park in the contiguous United States. Across this vast expanse, salt flats, volcanic hills, sweeping sand dunes, and distant snowcapped peaks create a landscape shaped by time and extremes. From the soaring heights of Telescope Peak, which rises over 11,000 feet above the desert floor, to the depths of Badwater Basin, 282 feet below sea level, the park is a study in contrasts.
> 
> Rare rainstorms can trigger brief bursts of wildflowers across parts of the valley, while hidden oases sustain wildlife and more than 1,000 plant species thrive against the odds. At Badwater Basin, pictured here, the land sinks to its lowest point in North America. Its blinding white salt flats stretch to the horizon, fractured into geometric patterns that make each step feel surreal. Long before it earned its foreboding name in 1849, the Timbisha Shoshone people called this valley home.
> 
> Recognizing its unique landscapes, President Herbert Hoover designated Death Valley a national monument on this day in 1933. That protection expanded in 1994, when the California Desert Protection Act elevated it to national park status and more than doubled its size, ensuring the preservation of this extraordinary desert for generations to come.

> Darwin Day marks more than a birthday—it marks a shift in thinking. Charles Darwin's observations connected variation, the survival of individuals best suited to their environment, and inheritance in ways science still builds on. His legacy rests on years of studying variation—finches, fossils, barnacles—and recognizing patterns others had overlooked. When 'On the Origin of Species' was published in 1859, it offered a framework explaining how species evolve through natural selection.
> 
> One of the most recognizable animals tied to Darwin's work is the blue-footed booby, seen in today's image. Widely associated with the Galápagos Islands, these seabirds range across the eastern tropical Pacific. They are known for their bright blue feet, a trait shaped by both diet and sexual selection. The color comes from carotenoid pigments obtained through fish such as sardines and anchovies. In both male and female, brighter feet signal better health and a stronger immune system. Males display their feet prominently during courtship, while females with more vivid pigmentation tend to produce healthier offspring. These birds hunt by diving straight into the water at high speed, using sharp eyesight to target schooling fish. Boobies stand as a reminder that evolution isn't a closed chapter—it's an ongoing process.

> Before bridges, rivers set the pace of travel. Now, with bridges, people do. That shift explains why cross-border links like the Third Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge connecting Laos and Thailand matter. Bridges come in many forms, each built to meet a specific challenge. Arch bridges manage compression, suspension bridges span long distances, and concrete box-girder bridges prioritize stability and load efficiency. This bridge uses the box-girder design, making it a practical choice for crossing the wide, fast-moving Mekong River.
> 
> Opened in 2011, the Third Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge was developed to strengthen transport links between Nakhon Phanom Province in Thailand and Thakhek, in Khammouane Province, Laos. Thailand funded much of the project, continuing a pattern set by earlier crossings such as the First Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge between Nong Khai and Vientiane and the Second Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge linking Mukdahan and Savannakhet.
> 
> Measuring about 4,669 feet, the bridge comprises two traffic lanes, serving local commuters and long-haul freight alike. This has helped ease congestion at other crossings and made cross-border movement more reliable. Beyond transport efficiency, the bridge supports logistics, tourism, and cross-border cooperation, showing how infrastructure can quietly reshape regional connections without demanding attention.

> Valentine's Day celebrates the heart in all its forms—love that is bold or tender, hopeful or quietly vulnerable. Few symbols capture this emotion as naturally as the bleeding heart flower, pictured here. With its unmistakable heart-shaped blooms, the plant emerges each spring, growing up to 2 feet tall and spreading nearly 30 inches wide, creating a graceful, almost poetic display.
> 
> That beauty, however, is fleeting. As warmer weather arrives, the bleeding heart completes its cycle: the flowers fade, the foliage retreats, and by late spring or early summer, the plant slips gently into dormancy. Its short-lived bloom is part of its charm.
> 
> Unlike flowers that demand attention, bleeding hearts offer a quieter kind of romance. Their brief bloom reminds us that connections feel meaningful because they evolve over time. Valentine's Day reflects that idea as well. Whether you're celebrating a new relationship, honoring a long partnership, or simply acknowledging the people who matter most, the day is about recognition as much as romance. Seen through that lens, the bleeding heart fits the moment—simple, sincere, and meaningful without needing to last forever.

<summary>Description</summary>

> World Whale Day, observed on the third Sunday of February, began in the 1980s in Hawaii, where communities celebrated the seasonal return of migrating humpback whales. The day gained wider recognition after the International Whaling Commission's 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling, which marked a major milestone in international whale conservation.
> 
> Humpback whales are easily recognizable by their long pectoral fins and are known for their complex songs associated with breeding behavior. Their predictable migrations bring them close to shore, turning them into both a cultural marker of the season and a focal point for early conservation efforts.
> 
> Today, whale conservation extends far beyond hunting restrictions and includes how we use and manage the oceans more broadly. Fishing activity, major shipping routes, underwater noise, plastic waste, and rising ocean temperatures all influence whale movement and feeding patterns. Pictured here are humpback whales feeding cooperatively in Monterey Bay—a behavior that depends on healthy ecosystems and reliable prey availability. Whales also contribute to ocean systems by circulating nutrients that support plankton growth and marine food webs. World Whale Day highlights the ongoing importance of thoughtful ocean stewardship in maintaining balanced marine ecosystems.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Presidents' Day is observed on the third Monday of February and is officially recognized at the federal level as Washington's Birthday. The holiday was originally celebrated on February 22, George Washington's birthday, before being rescheduled under the Uniform Monday Holiday Act. Passed in 1968 and implemented in 1971, the Act shifted several federal holidays to Mondays, creating standardized long weekends. Washington's Birthday was among those affected, which moved the observance away from Washington's actual birthday and allowed its meaning to broaden over time.
> 
> Although the federal name remains unchanged, Presidents' Day is commonly observed as a day that extends beyond a single figure. Many states and communities use the occasion to recognize multiple US presidents, most often George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, whose birthdays both fall in February. This broader interpretation has developed through public custom rather than federal mandate, shaping how the holiday is understood today.
> 
> Pictured here, the Lincoln Memorial stands on the National Mall in Washington, DC, honoring the 16th president and his leadership during the Civil War. Presidents' Day invites reflection on how the presidency has influenced the nation's institutions and public life, linking early leadership to the role the office continues to play in the United States today.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, marks the beginning of a new year on the traditional Chinese lunisolar calendar. This calendar follows the phases of the moon and the rhythms of the seasons. Red lanterns—like the ones shown in today's image—are widely associated with the celebration. The holiday falls on the new moon between January 21 and February 20 and has been observed for more than 2,000 years. In 2024, UNESCO added the Spring Festival to its Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list, recognizing its cultural and historical importance.
> 
> The festival follows a 15-day sequence, beginning on Chinese New Year's Eve and ending with the Lantern Festival. Each day traditionally carries its own customs, though practices vary from region to region. Even with these regional differences, the overall progression of the celebration remains similar across communities, reflecting a shared cultural framework tied to the lunar calendar.
> 
> The date of Chinese New Year changes annually because it is based on lunar cycles rather than the Gregorian calendar. This shifting date sets it apart from fixed-date holidays and explains why the festival's timing varies each year, even though its internal structure stays consistent.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This species missed the domestication memo and kept going on its own terms. Say hello to Przewalski's horse, considered the last truly wild horse on Earth. Once widespread across Central Asia, it disappeared from the wild in the 1960s after decades of hunting, habitat loss, and competition with livestock. Its survival depended on an unlikely lifeline: a small number of individuals captured by early 20th‑century collectors, which became the foundation of all modern Przewalski's horses.
> 
> Thanks to global breeding and reintroduction programs, the species has made a cautious comeback. Today, small but stable groups roam protected areas in Mongolia, China, and Russia. Przewalski's horses graze for long stretches, shifting between grasses, herbs, and shrubs as seasons change. They live in small family groups led by a dominant stallion, while bachelor males often form separate bands. Mares usually give birth to a single foal in the late spring, when fresh vegetation peaks.
> 
> Even with these gains, recovery remains fragile. Climate extremes and limited genetic diversity continue to challenge recovery. As a symbolic nod, 2026 marks the Year of the Horse in the Chinese calendar—shining a spotlight on a species that nearly vanished but endures against the odds.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Dragon's Eye sounds like something pulled from legend, and standing on Norway's Uttakleiv Beach in the Lofoten Islands, it's easy to see why. The formation, carved into ancient rock and framed by sand and sea, looks uncannily alive, as though the land itself is watching you. Shaped over thousands of years by ice and water, it has become one of the region's most captivating sights.
> 
> Despite its mythic name, the Dragon's Eye is actually a glacial pothole. It is a circular hollow sculpted into metamorphic rocks by turbulent meltwater flowing beneath the vast Fennoscandian Ice Sheet around 20,000 years ago. Under intense pressure, water carrying sand and stones ground into the bedrock, gradually eroding smooth-walled depressions. When the ice retreated roughly 16,000 years ago, these features were revealed, leaving behind formations like the Dragon's Eye, complete with a boulder—or 'pupil'—settled at its center.
> 
> Today, the Eye continues to shift with the elements. Depending on the tide, waves flood the hollow or strip it bare, while algae and light constantly reshape its expression, blurring the line between legend and landscape.
