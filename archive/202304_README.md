> 青蛙月开始于每年的4月1日。作为食物链的关键一环，青蛙是一种很重要的生物，它们擅长捕食蚊虫、苍蝇、蜘蛛，甚至老鼠，可以帮助控制害虫的数量。
> 
> 可悲的是，在过去的50年里，已经有至少200种青蛙灭绝了，许多人担心这可能预示着更大范围的生物多样性的丧失。所以，今年四月，让我们多花一些时间来了解这些不起眼的两栖动物，寻求更多拯救它们的方法。即便是从身边的小事做起，比如做好垃圾分类，不乱扔垃圾，这些细微的改变也将极大地改善青蛙的生存环境。

<summary>Description</summary>

> This sleepy-looking Javan tree frog, which is only found on the Indonesian island of Java, is the perfect mascot for National Frog Month. While not everyone is a fan, frogs play a critical role in the food chain, eating pests like mosquitoes, flies, spiders, and even mice.
> 
> It is estimated that at least 200 species of frogs have gone extinct in the last five decades and there are fears hundreds more will follow. So, this April, let's take a moment to learn more about these little amphibians and ways to save them. Even the smallest changes, such as being more wary of how we dispose of our trash, can be immensely beneficial for this important species.

> Welcome to the spectacular Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park, on the Indonesian island of Java, famous for stunning sunrises and its dramatic landscape. Here, a massive ancient volcano erupted thousands of years ago and inside its collapsed crater, more volcanoes formed.
> 
> To the left, spewing smoke and steam, is Mount Bromo, one of the most iconic sites in East Java, which has erupted at least four times in the last 20 years. In the forefront of the picture, with trees creeping up the sides, is Mount Batok, which is no longer active, while Java's highest mountain (and active volcano) Semeru, is visible in the background. The Tengger Sand Sea, a vast area of fine volcanic sand, wraps around five volcanoes inside the caldera. No wonder this massive national park is sometimes referred to as the land of sand and fire.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The Roman bridge of Córdoba, in the ancient Spanish city’s historic center, has been rebuilt several times over the centuries. For 2,000 years it was the city’s only bridge across the Guadalquivir River, originally built in the first century BCE during the expansion of the Roman Empire. Much of the current bridge dates from reconstruction in the 8th century following the Moorish conquest, a period when hundreds of mosques and palaces were built, and Córdoba became one of Europe's largest cities and a center of learning and culture.
> 
> While it has seen centuries of traffic, the bridge is now only open to pedestrians, following the opening of the Miraflores Bridge in 2004. If it looks familiar, you might have spotted it standing in as part of the fictional city of Volantis in 'Game of Thrones.'

> These showy males are squaring up in Kuusamo, Finland, a popular hang-out spot for black grouse as they take part in a flamboyant courtship ritual. They fan their tail feathers and inflate their necks while letting out a murmuring coo, hoping that a female selects them. This communal display is called lekking, and though we only see two birds here, these groups can number up to 200. Black grouse aren't the only animals known to participate in leks—bats, paper wasps, Atlantic cod, and fiddler crabs are among the many other species which go to the same lengths to find the right mate.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The full moon has inspired folklore, myths, writers, and artists throughout history and has been given many names, depending on the time of year it appears. April's first full moon is known as the pink moon, but that doesn’t mean it will appear pink against the night sky. Native Americans named it for the pink wildflowers, moss pink or creeping phlox, that bloom in the eastern US in the spring.
> 
> If it does appear pink, orange, or golden, it is because sunlight reflects off the moon and travels through our atmosphere. Here, dust, pollution, and other particles scatter the light, making it appear more colorful when it hangs lower in the sky. It appears whiter as it rises. Perhaps this pink moon is tinged by the dust of the Arizona desert.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Throughout history, humans have crafted legends to explain natural phenomena that defy our understanding. A prime example is the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland where some 40,000 basalt columns spring from the ground at the shore. Scientists tell us these columns developed 50 to 60 million years ago, when lava erupted from volcanic fissures, then cooled and contracted, cracking into hexagonal structures.
> 
> But Gaelic legend tells a different tale. It says the giant Fionn mac Cumhaill, anglicized as Finn McCool, built a bridge across the sea to fight his Scottish giant counterpart, Benandonner. The remains of his bridge are said to be found in the Giant's Causeway on one side, and Fingal's Cave on the Scottish island of Staffa, also formed by basalt columns. Though we understand the geology of the Giant's Causeway now, some may prefer to picture giants striding across the sea.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Humans have been decorating eggs for Easter for centuries, but decorated ostrich eggs have been found from as far back as 60,000 years ago, long before the Christian festival began. The Easter egg has long been a symbol of fertility and rebirth, but exactly why people started decorating them is unclear. One theory is that, because animal products were not eaten during the religious Lenten season, people would hard-boil the eggs and decorate them with dye and wax, until they could be eaten at Easter. A more opulent type of decorated egg, Fabergé eggs, were famously created as bejeweled Easter gifts to the Russian imperial family. Our homepage image shows eggs from Lithuania, where people use traditional methods to paint patterns with wax using sharp objects or etch patterns into dyed eggs.

<summary>Description</summary>

> We're in Kenya's Amboseli National Park today to celebrate Siblings Day with these baby African elephant twins and their mom. Siblings Day is celebrated every April 10 in parts of the US and other areas of the world. In 1995, Claudia Evart, who lost her siblings at a young age, created this holiday and established the Siblings Day Foundation, which is working to get the holiday officially recognized in the US alongside Mother's Day and Father's Day. India's Raksha Bandhan is the oldest sibling holiday that is still widely observed today, usually falling in August. Hindu women commemorate this day by wrapping a band around their brothers' wrists as a sign of mutual care and respect. If this seems like too much, maybe just pick up the phone and give a loved one a call.

> Mossy Grotto Falls is a tiny 20-foot waterfall in Oregon's Columbia River Gorge, home to around 90 waterfalls. This winsome waterfall became popular in recent years after several renowned photographers snapped it following its discovery in 2006. Waterfalls around the world draw our attention and inspire emotions (and even themes for pop songs). In contrast to the serene, burbling Mossy Grotto Falls, Angel Falls in Venezuela is the tallest in the world, where water plunges 2,648 feet before reaching the ground. This roaring wonder is awe-inspiring and one of the top tourist-draws in the country. If you need a moment of reflection, we recommend searching for the nearest waterfall and taking a trip to connect with nature.
