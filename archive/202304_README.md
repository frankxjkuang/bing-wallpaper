> 青蛙月开始于每年的4月1日。作为食物链的关键一环，青蛙是一种很重要的生物，它们擅长捕食蚊虫、苍蝇、蜘蛛，甚至老鼠，可以帮助控制害虫的数量。
> 
> 可悲的是，在过去的50年里，已经有至少200种青蛙灭绝了，许多人担心这可能预示着更大范围的生物多样性的丧失。所以，今年四月，让我们多花一些时间来了解这些不起眼的两栖动物，寻求更多拯救它们的方法。即便是从身边的小事做起，比如做好垃圾分类，不乱扔垃圾，这些细微的改变也将极大地改善青蛙的生存环境。

> This sleepy-looking Javan tree frog, which is only found on the Indonesian island of Java, is the perfect mascot for National Frog Month. While not everyone is a fan, frogs play a critical role in the food chain, eating pests like mosquitoes, flies, spiders, and even mice.
> 
> It is estimated that at least 200 species of frogs have gone extinct in the last five decades and there are fears hundreds more will follow. So, this April, let's take a moment to learn more about these little amphibians and ways to save them. Even the smallest changes, such as being more wary of how we dispose of our trash, can be immensely beneficial for this important species.

> Welcome to the spectacular Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park, on the Indonesian island of Java, famous for stunning sunrises and its dramatic landscape. Here, a massive ancient volcano erupted thousands of years ago and inside its collapsed crater, more volcanoes formed.
> 
> To the left, spewing smoke and steam, is Mount Bromo, one of the most iconic sites in East Java, which has erupted at least four times in the last 20 years. In the forefront of the picture, with trees creeping up the sides, is Mount Batok, which is no longer active, while Java's highest mountain (and active volcano) Semeru, is visible in the background. The Tengger Sand Sea, a vast area of fine volcanic sand, wraps around five volcanoes inside the caldera. No wonder this massive national park is sometimes referred to as the land of sand and fire.

> The Roman bridge of Córdoba, in the ancient Spanish city’s historic center, has been rebuilt several times over the centuries. For 2,000 years it was the city’s only bridge across the Guadalquivir River, originally built in the first century BCE during the expansion of the Roman Empire. Much of the current bridge dates from reconstruction in the 8th century following the Moorish conquest, a period when hundreds of mosques and palaces were built, and Córdoba became one of Europe's largest cities and a center of learning and culture.
> 
> While it has seen centuries of traffic, the bridge is now only open to pedestrians, following the opening of the Miraflores Bridge in 2004. If it looks familiar, you might have spotted it standing in as part of the fictional city of Volantis in 'Game of Thrones.'

> These showy males are squaring up in Kuusamo, Finland, a popular hang-out spot for black grouse as they take part in a flamboyant courtship ritual. They fan their tail feathers and inflate their necks while letting out a murmuring coo, hoping that a female selects them. This communal display is called lekking, and though we only see two birds here, these groups can number up to 200. Black grouse aren't the only animals known to participate in leks—bats, paper wasps, Atlantic cod, and fiddler crabs are among the many other species which go to the same lengths to find the right mate.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The full moon has inspired folklore, myths, writers, and artists throughout history and has been given many names, depending on the time of year it appears. April's first full moon is known as the pink moon, but that doesn’t mean it will appear pink against the night sky. Native Americans named it for the pink wildflowers, moss pink or creeping phlox, that bloom in the eastern US in the spring.
> 
> If it does appear pink, orange, or golden, it is because sunlight reflects off the moon and travels through our atmosphere. Here, dust, pollution, and other particles scatter the light, making it appear more colorful when it hangs lower in the sky. It appears whiter as it rises. Perhaps this pink moon is tinged by the dust of the Arizona desert.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Throughout history, humans have crafted legends to explain natural phenomena that defy our understanding. A prime example is the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland where some 40,000 basalt columns spring from the ground at the shore. Scientists tell us these columns developed 50 to 60 million years ago, when lava erupted from volcanic fissures, then cooled and contracted, cracking into hexagonal structures.
> 
> But Gaelic legend tells a different tale. It says the giant Fionn mac Cumhaill, anglicized as Finn McCool, built a bridge across the sea to fight his Scottish giant counterpart, Benandonner. The remains of his bridge are said to be found in the Giant's Causeway on one side, and Fingal's Cave on the Scottish island of Staffa, also formed by basalt columns. Though we understand the geology of the Giant's Causeway now, some may prefer to picture giants striding across the sea.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Humans have been decorating eggs for Easter for centuries, but decorated ostrich eggs have been found from as far back as 60,000 years ago, long before the Christian festival began. The Easter egg has long been a symbol of fertility and rebirth, but exactly why people started decorating them is unclear. One theory is that, because animal products were not eaten during the religious Lenten season, people would hard-boil the eggs and decorate them with dye and wax, until they could be eaten at Easter. A more opulent type of decorated egg, Fabergé eggs, were famously created as bejeweled Easter gifts to the Russian imperial family. Our homepage image shows eggs from Lithuania, where people use traditional methods to paint patterns with wax using sharp objects or etch patterns into dyed eggs.

Siblings Day is celebrated every April 10 in parts of the US and other areas of the world. In 1995, Claudia Evart, who lost her siblings at a young age, created this holiday and established the Siblings Day Foundation, which is working to get the holiday officially recognized in the US alongside Mother's Day and Father's Day. India's Raksha Bandhan is the oldest sibling holiday that is still widely observed today, usually falling in August. Hindu women commemorate this day by wrapping a band around their brothers' wrists as a sign of mutual care and respect. If this seems like too much, maybe just pick up the phone and give a loved one a call.

For starters, despite their name, they aren't fish—they belong to a group of marine invertebrates called echinoderms. Like all echinoderms, sea stars are characterized by the radial symmetry of their bodies, which usually have multiple arms extending from the central disc.
> 
> Did you know that sea stars can regenerate their arms? This means if they are attacked by a predator, they can get back into shape eventually (and quite literally). In fact, some species can also regenerate an entirely new sea star from just the arm, provided it still has a bit of the central disc attached to it.

There they were initially used to measure distance, but over the years they have been tapped for fishing, sport, science, celebration, communication, and recreation. Kites can take many shapes and be made of various materials, but all of them have a wing surface, a tether, and a bridle that keeps the surface at an angle to the wind. In fact, you can easily make your own, and there's no better time than today: Go Fly a Kite Day.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Get out your pen and paper—it's International Haiku Poetry Day! Haikus originated in Japan as the opening segment of a larger poem called a renga. Eventually they became individual poems of their own. A traditional haiku consists of 17 phonetic units—similar to a syllable—in a 5, 7, 5 formation. Though simple, a great haiku creates a sense of beauty and a connection to nature. That connection was captured in the artwork seen here, 'One Thousand Springs,' an installation of 5,000 haikus suspended within a web of red threads by artist Chiharu Shiota. It was part of the 2021 Japan Festival at Kew Royal Botanic Gardens in London. Here's some inspiration for you to write a haiku yourself:
> 
> poetry blooms bright / scattered by the vernal winds / may it take strong root

<summary>Description</summary>

> Located high in the Andes Mountains, Peru's Machu Picchu is believed to have been an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti, who ruled in the mid-15th century. This 'Lost City of the Incas' is one of the world's most famous archaeological sites, an engineering marvel, built without mortar, metal tools, or the wheel. As an icon of Inca civilization, it is a perfect fit for UNESCO's International Day for Monuments and Sites, which has been celebrating important cultural heritage sites for 40 years. Landmarks such as the Pueblo Indian dwellings of Mesa Verde, the Taj Mahal, the Great Pyramid of Giza, and the Parthenon give us the opportunity to look back at the cultures that came before us and preserve their memory for future generations.

> Procida is a charming Italian island in the Gulf of Naples, boasting colorful buildings, picturesque streets, and stunning sea views. The island has a rich history, having been settled by the Greeks, Romans, and other civilizations over the centuries, but is less well-known than its larger neighbours, Capri and Ischia. Its oldest fishing village, Marina Corricella, features pastel-colored buildings and narrow streets and is a great place to enjoy fresh seafood and soak up the atmosphere. From there, you can climb up to the fortified medieval village of Terra Murata, built on the island's highest point, which offers panoramic views over the entire Gulf of Naples.
> 
> Procida is home to several beautiful beaches and coves, including Chiaiolella, Spiaggia del Postino, and Ciraccio. And it's popular with film makers too, starring in more than 30 movies including 'The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,' 'The Talented Mr. Ripley,' and 'Il Postino.' In 2022, it was named Italy's Capital of Culture, the first island to be awarded the honor.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This tiny island fox is a great cheerleader for Earth Day, which celebrates the achievements of the environmental movement. Island foxes exist only on the Channel Islands of Southern California. You can find them on six of the eight islands, and each island's fox is considered a unique subspecies. While numbers have never been huge, they declined catastrophically in the 1990s. Thanks to a recovery program, their population is growing steadily, and these tiny foxes have bounced back from the brink of extinction. If you want to visit Channel Islands National Park to see this success story, today is a good day to go. Admission fees at all national parks will be waived today to mark the start of National Park Week.

> 'There is no friend as loyal as a book,' Ernest Hemingway once wrote. On World Book Day, we are honoring these loyal friends in the German city of Stuttgart, where a huge monolithic cube is both a modern landmark and home to the city library. Opened in 2011, this striking building was designed by architect Eun Young Yi to be a calming, meditative space in a bustling city. Its interior is white, with splashes of color provided by the books that line its walls.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This mysterious door can be found in the woods in Germany's largest state, Bavaria, known for its stunning castles, mountains, and forests. The home of Oktoberfest, it also has a worldwide reputation for its beer and its northern region of Franconia, where our picture was taken, is a premier wine destination. This little door leads to an underground cellar near the village of Pünzendorf, and its naturally low temperature once made it an ideal place to store the beer and wine the area is famous for. These days, you might be more likely to find bats inside, so perhaps it's better admired from a distance.
