> 今天的照片是从圣天使堡（又称哈德良陵墓）拍下的罗马美景。圣天使堡是由罗马帝国皇帝哈德良所修建，用作自己和后代的陵墓。除他之外，还有许多皇帝被葬在这里，公元217年的卡拉卡拉是最后一位。
> 
> 从中世纪到19世纪，这座建筑被改造成了保卫罗马的堡垒，梵蒂冈也因此没有落入西哥特人和汪达尔人手中。1365年左右，圣天使堡成为了教会的财产。而在意大利统一后，这座建筑最终成为了博物馆，教会也就随之失去了它的所有权。
> 
> 即使在今天，这座雄伟的建筑仍然吸引着数百万来自世界各地的游客，一直是罗马游客最多的博物馆之一。

<summary>Description</summary>

> The first stage of the Tour de France, known as the Grand Départ, begins today, as the 110th edition of the world's most famous cycling race gets underway. The grueling event, first held in 1903, sees teams race more than 2,100 miles through the Pyrenees and the Alps to finish on the Champs-Élysées in Paris. The competition is divided into 21 day-long stages and while some parts stay the same, others vary from year to year. For example, our image features the Pont du Gard—an ancient Roman aqueduct bridge that was built during the first century AD—which only appeared in the 2019 race. The entire event takes place over a 23-day period, including rest days, as teams of eight cyclists compete for a cash prize and the coveted yellow jersey. For these riders, this competition is the apex of years of training and dedication. Bonne chance!

> Today is Halfway Day, which means we are halfway through 2023! Halfway Day begins at noon on July 2 during a regular 365-day year, and at midnight on July 2 during a leap year—so this year, we're celebrating at lunchtime.

> Dutch engineers don’t do things by halves. Pictured here is the Veluwemeer Aqueduct in the Netherlands. The project, completed in 2002, used an unusual engineering approach. Rather than a drawbridge or ferry to get cars over Lake Veluwemeer, engineers instead built this 'water bridge' to carry boats across the road. The N302 is a busy highway connecting the mainland to the province of Flevoland, and thanks to this design, both road and waterborne traffic can keep flowing freely. The aqueduct also has pedestrian crossings on both sides, so everyone benefits. No half measures were taken in designing an eye-catching transport solution that works for everyone.

> Is it hot enough for you? Chances are it is, as we get into what are typically the hottest months of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, thanks to the tilt of the Earth angling more towards the sun in summer. You may have heard this sweltering period called the dog days of summer, though that name doesn't come from hot dogs or panting pooches. Rather it comes from Sirius, the Dog Star, which becomes visible above the eastern horizon at daybreak during the summer. Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky, and is part of Canis Major, not to be confused with the Canis latrans, or coyote, in today's image, who is just trying to beat the heat.
