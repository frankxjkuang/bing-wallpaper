> 今天的照片是从圣天使堡（又称哈德良陵墓）拍下的罗马美景。圣天使堡是由罗马帝国皇帝哈德良所修建，用作自己和后代的陵墓。除他之外，还有许多皇帝被葬在这里，公元217年的卡拉卡拉是最后一位。
> 
> 从中世纪到19世纪，这座建筑被改造成了保卫罗马的堡垒，梵蒂冈也因此没有落入西哥特人和汪达尔人手中。1365年左右，圣天使堡成为了教会的财产。而在意大利统一后，这座建筑最终成为了博物馆，教会也就随之失去了它的所有权。
> 
> 即使在今天，这座雄伟的建筑仍然吸引着数百万来自世界各地的游客，一直是罗马游客最多的博物馆之一。

<summary>Description</summary>

> The first stage of the Tour de France, known as the Grand Départ, begins today, as the 110th edition of the world's most famous cycling race gets underway. The grueling event, first held in 1903, sees teams race more than 2,100 miles through the Pyrenees and the Alps to finish on the Champs-Élysées in Paris. The competition is divided into 21 day-long stages and while some parts stay the same, others vary from year to year. For example, our image features the Pont du Gard—an ancient Roman aqueduct bridge that was built during the first century AD—which only appeared in the 2019 race. The entire event takes place over a 23-day period, including rest days, as teams of eight cyclists compete for a cash prize and the coveted yellow jersey. For these riders, this competition is the apex of years of training and dedication. Bonne chance!

> Today is Halfway Day, which means we are halfway through 2023! Halfway Day begins at noon on July 2 during a regular 365-day year, and at midnight on July 2 during a leap year—so this year, we're celebrating at lunchtime.
> 
> Dutch engineers don’t do things by halves. Pictured here is the Veluwemeer Aqueduct in the Netherlands. The project, completed in 2002, used an unusual engineering approach. Rather than a drawbridge or ferry to get cars over Lake Veluwemeer, engineers instead built this 'water bridge' to carry boats across the road. The N302 is a busy highway connecting the mainland to the province of Flevoland, and thanks to this design, both road and waterborne traffic can keep flowing freely. The aqueduct also has pedestrian crossings on both sides, so everyone benefits. No half measures were taken in designing an eye-catching transport solution that works for everyone.

> Is it hot enough for you? Chances are it is, as we get into what are typically the hottest months of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, thanks to the tilt of the Earth angling more towards the sun in summer. You may have heard this sweltering period called the dog days of summer, though that name doesn't come from hot dogs or panting pooches. Rather it comes from Sirius, the Dog Star, which becomes visible above the eastern horizon at daybreak during the summer. Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky, and is part of Canis Major, not to be confused with the Canis latrans, or coyote, in today's image, who is just trying to beat the heat.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Break out the BBQ and unfurl your flags, Independence Day is here! Founding Father John Adams wrote to his wife, Abigail, that he believed the holiday would be celebrated with parades, sports, shows, and illuminations. After 247 years, Americans are keeping those traditions alive, though not on the date that Adams anticipated. The Second Continental Congress voted to approve the independence of the United States of America on July 2, 1776, but formally adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4. That date, enshrined on the Declaration document, became the one we observe today. If you're looking for a grand way to celebrate, journey to New York City for views of their annual fireworks show and the Empire State Building lit up to match in red, white, and blue.

> Porto Timoni beach, in Corfu, Greece, is a hidden gem reached either by boat, or by hiking from the historic village of Afionas. Those who make the journey are rewarded with two stunning coves, offering a unique double-beach experience. With clear turquoise waters and dramatic cliffs, Porto Timoni presents a picturesque coastal panorama. Surrounding the beach, lush olive groves and cypress trees add to its charm. Greek islands like Corfu may seem timeless and ancient but they are relatively new in the history of Earth. A leading theory is that around 5.3 million years ago, a great flood poured in between Africa and Europe from the Atlantic Ocean, an event called the Zanclean flood. Lakes became oceans and what were previously mountaintops became islands.

> This photograph captures a heartwarming moment between two southern rockhopper penguins, the perfect image for International Kissing Day. Why do we kiss? Well, dozens of cultures don't kiss on the lips at all. For those that do, theories range widely, from the chemical reactions in the brain, to ancient ancestral parents chewing food for their children, to simply smelling each other. Of course, no scientific explanation can capture the magic of a shared kiss. Perhaps that's why artists including Prince, Faith Hill, and Hall & Oates have all had chart-toppers about lip-locking; they have found a way to put an indescribable feeling into words.

> Happy World Chocolate Day! Hidden inside these colorful pods are cocoa seeds, or beans, which will be fermented, roasted, and ground on their way to being turned into chocolate, a sweet treat with a worldwide fanbase.
> 
> Chocolate has a fascinating history. Its origins can be traced back to the Indigenous Olmec people of Mesoamerica, who dried and fermented the seeds of the cacao tree to create an unsweetened alcoholic beverage. The solid chocolate bars we love today came much later, in the 19th century, when J.S. Fry and Sons put them into production. The company created its first solid bar in 1847, closely followed in 1849 by rival firm Cadbury. Things snowballed from there and today, we are spoiled for choice. So, whether you prefer the creamy sweetness of milk chocolate, or the bitterness of super dark chocolate, today is the perfect time to indulge yourself in this delicious confection.

> Our homepage image shows Zhangye National Geopark's Rainbow Mountains in China, an incredible landscape created over millions of years. Those colorful layers are formed of sedimentary sandstone rock. Iron oxide gave the rock its predominately rusty hue, while other oxides tinted the various layers brown, yellow, and green. Sandstone and minerals that were once layered on top of each other were lifted and distorted by tectonic movement, revealing those colorful stripes. And that is not the end of this geological tale. This unique landscape continues to change, as wind and water erosion sculpts new pillars and ravines. No matter what your favorite category of rock is—metamorphic, sedimentary, or igneous—rocks of every kind helped build the world we live in today.

Today’s homepage shows blacktip reef sharks, hunting in a group in the waters around the Maldives, one of more than 500 species of shark, each uniquely adapted to its habitat. From the graceful hammerhead with its panoramic vision to the fastest species, the sleek mako, shark species are diverse, but a third face extinction. Among threats are unregulated fishing and abandoned nets as well as demand for shark fins. They have a fearsome reputation but are the victims of myths and misconceptions that paint them as mindless killing machines.

The Catskills also hold a place in cultural history, attracting artists and dreamers and as the fictional setting for the movie Dirty Dancing—which was actually filmed in Pembroke, Virginia. With other attractions including ski resorts and picturesque small towns and hamlets, visitors continue to flock to the Catskills, a huge wilderness within driving distance of more than 20 million Americans.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Cloughoughter Castle sits on a small island in the middle of Lough Oughter, a huge complex of lakes and waterways in County Cavan in Ireland. Its first stones are thought to have been laid in the early 13th century by the Anglo-Norman de Lacy family, but the O'Reilly clan took possession of the area in 1233 and completed the castle's construction. They retained control of Cloughoughter Castle for centuries, but by 1653, it had been bombed and abandoned. Since then, it has been in ruins, resplendent in a sort of tattered grandeur. It can only be visited by boat but, as a symbol of Ireland's medieval heritage, it is a must-see for history and castle enthusiasts alike.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The great hornbill is a remarkable bird found in the tropical forests of Southeast Asia. Despite weighing as much as 9 pounds and growing up to 4 feet long, it is an agile flyer capable of maneuvering through dense forests. Alongside its striking black and yellow plumage, the great hornbill has a unique helmet-like casque on its bill, which amplifies its calls. The bird primarily feeds on fruit but also eats small mammals, reptiles, and insects. While incubating her eggs, the female great hornbill seals herself inside a tree cavity, leaving a small opening through which the male inserts food. This magnificent bird holds cultural and spiritual significance in many Southeast Asian cultures as a sacred animal and the subject of festivals.

> International Moon Day is celebrated on July 20, the day humans first set foot on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission in 1969. It recognizes our lunar achievements and highlights scientific and technological advancements, like NASA's Orion spacecraft, seen here. Designed for deep space exploration, Orion completed a test flight to the moon without astronauts in 2022 and will carry out a crewed orbit in 2024. The plan is to return astronauts to the moon's surface in 2025. NASA hopes that these flights, along with events like International Moon Day, will encourage public engagement and education about the moon and its influence on Earth, as well as the potential for future space exploration and colonization.

> Norway's picturesque Atlantic Ocean Road crosses eight bridges as it makes its way across islands, islets, and reefs to link the island of Averøya with the mainland Romsdal Peninsula. The longest of them, pictured here, is the Storseisundet Bridge. This bridge, surrounded by ample natural beauty, was tough to build. It took six years, and during construction workers were pelted by the region's unpredictable weather, including 12 hurricanes. It opened in 1989 and remains a popular visitor attraction. With its dramatic curve and sudden incline, Storseisundet Bridge creates the illusion of suddenly disappearing into the ocean, making drivers skip a heartbeat. Its construction showcases the brilliance of Norwegian engineering, blending seamlessly with the landscape.
