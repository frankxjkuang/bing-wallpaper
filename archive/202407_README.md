<summary>Description</summary>

> Today, Canada celebrates its national day. It commemorates the passing of the Constitution Act of 1867, which joined three British colonies, the Province of Canada (later Quebec and Ontario), New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, to become the self-governing country of Canada.
> 
> Canada is the second-largest country by landmass after Russia. Eighty percent of its land is unoccupied and every corner abounds in natural treasures—like the Great Bear Rainforest, the Northwest Passage, the Columbia Icefield or the Haida Gwaii archipelago. Celebrations including parades, fireworks, and other patriotic festivities will be held across this huge country today. Among those hosting events will be the Fisgard Lighthouse, pictured on our homepage looking out over Esquimalt Harbor in Colwood, British Columbia. The tower was the first lighthouse on the west coast of Canada, built on Fisgard Island in 1860.

<summary>Description</summary>

> It was the year 206 BCE. In the wake of the decisive Roman victory against the Carthaginians at the Battle of Ilipa, General Publius Cornelius Scipio built a settlement for veterans on the banks of the Guadalquivir River, in modern-day Spain. It was named Italica and was the first Roman settlement on the Iberian Peninsula. The city flourished in the following centuries and was the birthplace of two Roman emperors, Trajan and Hadrian.
> 
> The ruins of Italica, close to Seville, include the impressive amphitheater seen in today's image. One of the largest in the Roman Empire, it could accommodate up to 25,000 spectators, more than double the city's population. Beyond this, there are remains of public buildings, a temple built in honor of Trajan, baths, and villas decorated with stunning mosaics. Italica is an archeological gem, offering a glimpse into the grandeur of the Roman Empire.
