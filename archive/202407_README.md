<summary>Description</summary>

> Today, Canada celebrates its national day. It commemorates the passing of the Constitution Act of 1867, which joined three British colonies, the Province of Canada (later Quebec and Ontario), New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, to become the self-governing country of Canada.
> 
> Canada is the second-largest country by landmass after Russia. Eighty percent of its land is unoccupied and every corner abounds in natural treasures—like the Great Bear Rainforest, the Northwest Passage, the Columbia Icefield or the Haida Gwaii archipelago. Celebrations including parades, fireworks, and other patriotic festivities will be held across this huge country today. Among those hosting events will be the Fisgard Lighthouse, pictured on our homepage looking out over Esquimalt Harbor in Colwood, British Columbia. The tower was the first lighthouse on the west coast of Canada, built on Fisgard Island in 1860.

<summary>Description</summary>

> It was the year 206 BCE. In the wake of the decisive Roman victory against the Carthaginians at the Battle of Ilipa, General Publius Cornelius Scipio built a settlement for veterans on the banks of the Guadalquivir River, in modern-day Spain. It was named Italica and was the first Roman settlement on the Iberian Peninsula. The city flourished in the following centuries and was the birthplace of two Roman emperors, Trajan and Hadrian.
> 
> The ruins of Italica, close to Seville, include the impressive amphitheater seen in today's image. One of the largest in the Roman Empire, it could accommodate up to 25,000 spectators, more than double the city's population. Beyond this, there are remains of public buildings, a temple built in honor of Trajan, baths, and villas decorated with stunning mosaics. Italica is an archeological gem, offering a glimpse into the grandeur of the Roman Empire.

<summary>Description</summary>

> It is World Meerkat Day, a celebration of these adorably upstanding creatures. Despite the name, they are not related to cats. They're small carnivores of the mongoose family, native to the deserts and grasslands of southwestern Africa. Meerkats live in mobs, tight-knit groups of up to 30 individuals that forage together, groom each other, and take turns watching for predators. These critters create huge burrows where they spend the night and retreat to escape the midday heat.
> 
> World Meerkat Day, founded in 2018, raises awareness about meerkats and their ecological importance, which includes controlling insect populations in their desert habitats. So, let's spread the word, ensuring future generations continue to be captivated by these remarkable creatures.

Conwy Castle was built between 1283 and 1287 on the orders of English King Edward I, during his conquest of Wales. Designed by James of St. George, one of the greatest architects of the time, the castle is a UNESCO World Heritage Site which draws visitors from across the world.

Spectators gather to witness the nautical parade and enjoy local delicacies like bara brith, a tea bread flavored with tea, dried fruits, and spices, and laverbread made from edible seaweed. The name Conwy is from the Welsh words 'cyn' (chief) and 'gwy' (water) and the town sits at the mouth of the river. It is also the gateway to Eryri National Park, home to Wales's highest mountain Yr Wyddfa, or Snowdon in English.

> Celebrate National Blueberry Day by indulging in the sweet, tangy flavors of this beloved fruit. Wild blueberries are native to North America and have been around for over 13,000 years. However, they weren't commercially farmed until the early 20th century, when the first domesticated variety was bred in New Jersey by Elizabeth Coleman White, an agricultural specialist, and botanist Frederick Coville.
> 
> The United States is a leading blueberry producer, with bountiful harvests from states including Maine, Michigan, and Oregon. Blueberries are North America's second-most popular berry, after strawberries. They're not just delicious—they are also fiber-rich and packed with antioxidants and vitamin C. So, toss them in your smoothies, sprinkle them over oatmeal, or savor them fresh and flaunt your blue-stained smile.

> 1987年，世界人口达到50亿大关，这是一个意义非凡的里程碑，由此产生了一个国际性的纪念日：五十亿人口日。伴随着急速增长的人口，一些相关的问题也亟待解决。因此，在1989年，联合国设立了世界人口日。如今，这不仅仅是一个纪念日，更是一个行动的呼吁。人口过剩导致地球的资源越来越少，敦促人类去正视那些紧迫的问题，如计划生育、垃圾和污染的增加、基础设施的缺失等等。当大都市里的人在和“过度拥挤”做斗争时，小地方的人口却在不断流失，导致人口分布失衡。一个典型的案例就是意大利西西里岛的甘吉镇，即今天图片展示的地方。在20世纪50年代，这个村庄大约有1.6万居民，如今，其人口只有6000多一点。为了振兴小镇，吸引人们的关注，甘吉镇将废弃的房屋赠送给那些有需要且愿意修复房屋的人。

> In 1987, sometime around July 11, the world population reached the 5-billion mark. The United Nations recognized the need to address issues like family planning, infrastructure, waste, and pollution and established World Population Day in 1989. It is estimated that we hit 8 billion people in November 2022 and the UN expects the world to reach 9.7 billion people in 2050. But not everywhere faces the same challenges. While some areas struggle with overcrowding, others grapple with decreasing populations. The Italian town of Gangi, Sicily, seen in today's image, had about 16,000 residents in the 1950s. Today, it is home to little more than 6,000. Keen on revitalization, Gangi attracts new residents by giving away abandoned houses, on the condition that the properties are then restored.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Surrounded by rugged, dark landscapes, La Geria is a marvel of viticulture. Most of the Spanish island of Lanzarote is treeless and covered with black-gray soil. This thick blanket of volcanic gravel is the result of a series of eruptions in the 1700s. By 1775, farmers started growing crops in the new layer of nutrient-rich soil. Volcanic soil absorbs and retains moisture, and the ash keeps its temperature favorable for growing grapes. The holes surrounded by stones you see in our image were dug to protect young grape plants from strong winds. La Geria's innovative approach to cultivation in an arid climate has been rewarded with its abundance of fine wine, fermented from Malvasia grapes.

> Archaeology might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of festivals, but the Festival of British Archaeology, July 13-28, is here to change that. Since its inception in 1990, it has evolved into a two-week event. A clever shift from September to July has made it easier for archaeological buffs to explore summer digs and heritage wonders. This year's theme of 'Archaeology and Community' invites enthusiasts across the United Kingdom for an array of in-person and virtual events. Imagine standing amid Skara Brae's ancient stone houses on Scotland's Orkney archipelago, pictured here, where Neolithic settlers thrived over 5,000 years ago. Exposed by an 1850 storm, this prehistoric marvel is dubbed the 'Scottish Pompeii' due to its astonishing preservation—older than Stonehenge and even the Great Pyramids. So, grab your trowel, and get ready to dig deep into the incredible, storied past. Who knows what you'll discover!

<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to Rothenburg ob der Tauber, or 'Red Fortress above the Tauber River,' where medieval charm is around every cobbled corner. A self-ruling city in the Middle Ages, this walled Bavarian town once flourished with 6,000 inhabitants, the Holy Roman Empire's second-largest city at the time. The growth of Rothenburg ob der Tauber slowed in the 17th century, preserving its original character.
> 
> Pictured here is the Burgtor (castle gate), which was built after the original Rothenburg Castle was destroyed by an earthquake in 1356. Within the castle gate is an 'eye-of-the-needle' door, designed to be the only way in and out once the main gates closed at night. But Rothenburg's magic isn't confined to its walls. It's also a gateway to the 290-mile Romantic Road that runs from Würzburg to Füssen, covering Bavaria's castle-studded valleys.
