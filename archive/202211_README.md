> It may seem odd to celebrate death—after all, it's the end of our personal era. But tell that to people who celebrate the Day of the Dead, or el Día de los Muertos, and they'll smile. They may explain that death is part of the circle of life, and as natural as any other human milestone. As our photo shows, the Day of the Dead is a big holiday in Mexico, where calacas—skeleton figures of musicians, workers, and other folks in merry scenes of everyday 'life'—lurk everywhere for weeks before the main event. Of course, living people also play dead for the day, donning skeleton outfits, masks, and grotesque makeup. Music, processions, and food add to the quirky, fun carnival atmosphere.
> 
> The Day of the Dead has deep roots in Mexico. In Aztec times, for example, the belief was that after people died, they traveled to the Land of the Dead, called Chicunamictlán. Mexico's pre-Hispanic beliefs eventually melded with Catholic celebrations of All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day to create the joyous event celebrated today. Families leave food or other gifts on their loved ones' graves or on homemade altars called 'ofrendas,' welcoming deceased relatives for the day. No wonder it's viewed as a happy holiday—you get to hang out with the spirits of the dearly loved people whom you've lost. (Just don't let Uncle Joe tell one of his jokes.)

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we're looking back to a time when an eccentric billionaire's dream of reaching new heights was still a novel idea. It was 75 years ago today that Howard Hughes' 'flying boat,' dubbed the 'Spruce Goose,' made its one and only flight. Officially named the Hughes H-4 Hercules, the press persisted in calling it the 'Spruce Goose' even though it was constructed almost entirely of birch wood. The plane was commissioned in 1942 by American industrialist Henry Kaiser, who supplied ships to the US during World War II. Kaiser recruited Hughes—the film producer turned pilot, engineer, and business magnate—to build a flying cargo ship that could avoid German submarines while transporting troops and war supplies across the Atlantic. The contract called for three of the planes to be built within two years. Hughes was still working on the design when the war ended—in the end, he delivered only the one in our photo, two years after V-E Day.
> 
> Adjusted for inflation, the Spruce Goose cost roughly $213 million. It remains the largest flying boat ever built and when it was finished, it had the longest wingspan of any previously built aircraft at 320 feet, 11 inches. Even though the plane was no longer needed for the war effort, Hughes was committed to seeing it fly, which it did, but just barely. After liftoff, it flew at 135 mph roughly 70 feet above the water. It cruised for about a mile for a whopping 26 seconds. 'I put the sweat of my life into this thing,' Hughes had said just a few months prior, vowing to leave the country if it was a failure. Failure is in the eye of the beholder, however, as Hughes never left and his spending of government funds was considered reasonable, because, technically, the Spruce Goose did fly.

> UNESCO designated November 3, 2022, the first annual International Day for Biosphere Reserves. Biosphere reserves are vast areas around the world used to promote biodiversity, cultural diversity, environmentally sustainable economic development, and research and education on how humans can coexist with nature.
> 
> The Amboseli Biosphere Reserve, which we feature today, is located on the Kenyan side of Mount Kilimanjaro and includes an amazing variety of ecological zones, including dry mountain forests, mountains, savannah rangelands, wetlands, and swamps. Elephants, lions, and giraffes make their home in the Amboseli. Designated a UNESCO biosphere reserve in 1980, Amboseli was a focus of a UN-sponsored program to ensure the long-term conservation of biodiversity in the area, partly by involving the local population in sustainable use.

<summary>Description</summary>

> A hundred years ago today, British archaeologist and Egyptologist Howard Carter discovered the sarcophagus of Tutankhamun, better known as King Tut, in Egypt's Valley of the Kings. Though they first uncovered the tomb of the 'boy king' on November 4, 1922, Carter and crew took years to excavate the burial site. What they found astonished the world. It was loaded with more than 5,000 artifacts, including a solid gold coffin, face mask, thrones, archery bows, trumpets, a lotus chalice, furniture, food, wine, sandals, gold caps to protect Tut's toes, and fresh linen underwear. Because you should always bring clean undies, even when you're crossing into the realm of the dead.
> 
> Though Tut is considered a minor pharaoh by historians, the discovery of his tomb was one of the most significant in the history of archaeology. The burial site was remarkably well preserved—unlike many neighboring tombs, it was untouched by grave robbers, thanks to debris covering the entrance for most of the tomb's existence. In the 1960s, Egypt allowed the treasures of King Tut to leave the country for display, and the exhibit has traveled the world numerous times. Today, King Tut's death mask and sarcophagus are displayed here at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.

Queen Victoria spent time here in its heyday, and though the old hotel (it was built in 1849) declined over the years, a multimillion-dollar restoration has brought it right back to its former glory.
> 
> Tigh Mor sits above Loch Achray in Scotland's Trossachs, a region with scenery so stunning it draws artists and painters like moths to a flame. Writers are also inspired by its beauty: Way back in the early 1800s Sir Walter Scott's poem 'The Lady of the Lake' and novel 'Rob Roy' stirred interest in visiting this area of wooded glens, braes, and waterways called 'the Trossachs.'
> 
> Today many visitors hike or bike the Trossachs Trail, a beautiful 40-mile route that starts at Loch Lomond and winds along rivers and through woods, offering family-friendly adventures as well as challenges for mountain bikers and rock climbers. More of a water person? The Trossachs are also great for canoeing, kayaking, paddleboarding, sailing, swimming, and fishing on rivers and lochs aplenty.

> The route for the 2022 New York City Marathon starts right here at the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, crossing from Staten Island into Brooklyn and eventually coursing through all five boroughs of New York. This photo gives you an idea just how many people will be running today. Because the race starts early on a November morning, many runners show up in layered clothing to beat the typical chill. But once they heat up from running, those layers come off and are often discarded on sidewalks. Race organizers collect the activewear left behind by 50,000 runners, about 26 tons a year, and donate it to charity.

<summary>Description</summary>

> If you missed the first full lunar eclipse of the year back in May, you'll get another chance tonight as the second blood moon (as lunar eclipses are often called) of 2022 takes to the sky over the Pacific region. Tonight's display can be seen from Asia, Australia, North America, and parts of northern Europe and South America. If you're lucky enough to find yourself under a clear sky, the view might look something like this image, taken over Mount Crested Butte, Colorado, during the lunar eclipse of September 27, 2015.
> 
> A lunar eclipse is a happy accident of the solar system and is possible because of relative sizes of and distances between the sun, Earth, and moon. Every couple of years on average, the Earth casts a perfect shadow on the moon, causing a full lunar eclipse. During a full solar eclipse, the moon casts a perfect shadow on the Earth. While not as rare, and perhaps not quite as dramatic as a solar eclipse, lunar eclipses have plenty of upsides. For one, you can safely look at them without doing any harm to your eyes. They last for hours, while solar eclipses last minutes. And a lunar eclipse is visible from a much larger portion of the planet—in fact, the eclipsed moon can be seen at the time of the eclipse wherever the moon is above the horizon.
> 
> If you want to see tonight's lunar eclipse in the US, you'll likely have to sacrifice some sleep. Totality on the West Coast begins at 2:16 AM, 5:16 AM on the East Coast, and will last about 85 minutes. The next total lunar eclipse won't happen until March 2025, so a few hours of lost sleep seem a small price to pay for this dazzling view.

It's a beautiful celebration, as you can see, and it happens around the second full moon at this time of year ('yi' means 'two' and 'peng' means 'full moon day'). Our photo shows the lanterns in Chiang Mai, Thailand's second-largest city and the home of the most famous Yi Peng observance, which has strong ties to the Lanna people of northern Thailand.

> Yi Peng is a religious festival that also features entertainment and local traditional food. It is believed that sending lanterns up into the sky will honor the gods, and traditionally the release of lanterns has represented letting go of bad luck and wishing for good fortune. During the festival, lanterns or candles are also lit outside homes and businesses to show devotion to the Buddha.

Our friend in today's photo is in Sussex, England, but European hedgehogs are widespread across the continent. They're thought to be the largest and heaviest of the hedgehog family. A nocturnal creature, the hedgehog can often be found in gardens snacking on its preferred diet of insects.

> The European hedgehog is sometimes considered an invasive species. In New Zealand, for example, the hedgehog has no natural predators and threatens the food supply of native bush birds. But it's hard to blame such a cute little creature. With roughly 6,000 spines on its back, the hedgehog was, at one point, used as an unofficial symbol for NATO, chosen because it's a peaceful animal that has a rather pointed defense system.

The region has a 12,000-year history as hunting grounds for Native Americans. In fact, the name we know it by today, Badlands, comes from the Lakota phrase 'mako sica,' which literally translates to 'bad lands.' Covering nearly 380 square miles, its harshly eroded rock formations make it one of the most distinct landscapes in the United States.

> On the National Mall in Washington, DC, just north of the Reflecting Pool, is a sculpture honoring the women who served during the Vietnam War. The military efforts of women, less visible than those of men, are commemorated by the Vietnam Women's Memorial, featured today on Veterans Day. While Memorial Day honors those who died during military service, Veterans Day recognizes the service of all veterans, whether or not they served during a war. Veterans Day, a federal holiday, was originally known as Armistice Day and coincides with the anniversary of the end of World War I. For this reason, other countries also observe today as a holiday.
> 
> The Vietnam Women's Memorial was officially dedicated on Veterans Day in 1993. During the Vietnam War, 265,000 American women volunteered to serve. About 11,000 were stationed in Vietnam, most as nurses. Women were not allowed to serve in combat roles then as they are now. It took decades before their contributions were publicly acknowledged with the addition of this memorial. It depicts three uniformed women tending to a wounded soldier and reminds us of the roles women played during this and other wars, often behind the scenes, as nurses, physicians, air traffic controllers, translators, and intelligence officers.

The River Quoich is frequented by nature lovers, hikers, and intrepid paddlers willing to brave its surprisingly swift currents and its several waterfalls, including the one featured here, the Linn of Quoich. This spot is famous for the bowl-shaped cavity in the rock that you see on the left.

> Called the Punch Bowl, this natural feature has become the star attraction for those who visit the river and take the 3-mile hike along its banks. According to lore, the Earl of Mar, the 18th-century nobleman who owned the forest, placed a ceremonial punch bowl atop the hole and drank from it after a successful deer hunt. Queen Victoria loved these pine woods and built a rustic lodge near the falls around 1850. While the beauty of the River Quoich is fit for a queen, you don't have to be royalty to enjoy it.

> Halki, a tiny Greek island in the Aegean Sea, is the type of place you go to when you need a getaway from your getaway. Off the beaten path, Halki is quiet and sleepy when other Greek islands are flush with visitors. The only way to arrive is by ferry. Halki, with a total area of just 11 sun-kissed square miles, is the smallest inhabited island in the Dodecanese island group.
> 
> One of the most popular attractions on Halki is the ruins of this medieval castle built by the Knights of St. John in the 14th century in the now abandoned village of Chorio on the island's south-facing shore. It's a short, uphill walk from the only town on the island, the port village of Emporio, where most of the island's few hundred permanent residents live. A significant portion of the population left in the mid-20th century, many of them settling in the Gulf Coast town of Tarpon Springs, Florida, which lays claim to having the highest percentage of Greek Americans of any US city. People from Halki and other Greek islands were lured to Tarpon Springs to work as sponge divers, a skill they honed for generations in Greece. These days, not much goes on in Halki beyond eating, relaxing, and swimming. Like all Greek islands, Halki has beautiful beaches. Here, you're more likely to have them all to yourself.

> You 'otter' know something about the creatures in today's photo. They're a pair of North American river otters swimming in Maine's Acadia National Park. Technically members of the weasel family, these 'water dogs' aren't just locked into rivers. They can be found in other waterways and along the coasts of North America. A myopic animal with eyesight adapted to help with swimming, river otters will come right up on humans or boats, usually within a few feet.
> 
> They're active year-round, though they tend to do most of their business at night, which primarily consists of hunting and eating. River otters are highly active predators, usually going after fish, but they have been known to munch on fruit, reptiles, ducks, and even the rare beaver. River otters are highly sensitive to pollution, so will tend to disappear from tainted areas. Scientists value them as trusted bioindicators of the environments where they live due to the way their bodies accumulate various chemical compounds.

> It's National Take a Hike Day, so what better time to lace up those boots and head out on a trail to pay homage to John Muir, the patron saint (not really) of US hiking. Muir was instrumental in persuading the government that enjoying nature is the right of every American and that there should be an official national park system. He saw the spectacular beauty of the American West when he walked through the Sierra Nevada in California, and was passionate about preserving the country's national wonders. In 1892, Muir founded the Sierra Club, an environmental organization that protects wild lands to this day.

> The US boasts more than 60,000 miles of national trails, and you can choose coastal paths or mountain climbs, forest meanders or historical walks like Boston's Freedom Trail. Our photo shows Oregon's McKenzie River National Recreation Trail, part of the Willamette National Forest. This trail winds by lakes, rivers, and springs, guiding you through shady old-growth forests. One highlight: the view overlooking Tamolitch Blue Pool, a crystal-clear pool created by the river bubbling up into it.

This protected area about 8 miles west of Amsterdam is host to not only a diverse assortment of plants and animals, but also hundreds of specially designed sand dunes that help filter rainwater. The Waterleidingduinen ('water supply dunes') have been the source of the city's drinking water since the 19th century.

> Maybe for almost as long, red fox sightings have been common at the Waterleidingduinen. Red foxes are the world's largest foxes and are widespread across the Northern Hemisphere. They stick together with their families, the young often helping to care for the next generation of kits. Not fully content in the woods, red foxes are increasingly colonizing urban areas. It's just the latest move in a long history of foxes sharing the planet with humans, as they appear in the folklore of Native American, Greek, Celtic, and Chinese cultures.

> The sunflower is an eye-catcher, growing to the sky and brightly singing of summer no matter the time of year. Helianthus annuus is native to the Americas, and its flowering head is actually made up of more tiny flowers that mature into seeds (and, of course, get eaten around the world). But did you know that sunflowers also bring one of nature's mathematical wonders to life?
> 
> The gorgeous sunflower displays its seeds in two spirals that twist and curve in opposite directions, fanning out from the center to the golden petals. If you mapped either of those spirals on a graph, they would closely follow the Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21…), where you add a number to the one before it to get the next number. While the famous spiral formula is attributed to Fibonacci, the 13th-century Italian math whiz, scholars in India described the sequence centuries before him—and they probably weren't the first to figure it out either. But regardless of the origin story, each November 23 (11/23…get it?) we celebrate the infinite series known as the Fibonacci sequence.

> Whether made from scratch or plopped out of a can, your cranberry sauce started in a bog like the one seen here. Cranberry shrubs are planted in beds surrounded by dikes. Once the fruit ripens in the fall, the beds are flooded with water, creating bogs full of submerged shrubs. A harvester machine dislodges the berries, which float to the top of the water. Then they're easily corralled on the surface with flexible booms.
> 
> The very sour cranberries will need to be further processed, with lots and lots of sugar, to be palatable as turkey's best friend on the Thanksgiving table. Cranberries grow wild in the wetlands of North America and were an important food for Native Americans, who used them to make pemmican, a nutritious paste of berries, dried meat, and fat. Today, the US accounts for more than half of commercially grown cranberries in the world.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we mark Native American Heritage Day and Month with the imposing pyramid now known as Monks Mound, once the center of a city that rivaled any European city of the age in population. Built by people of the Mississippian culture, construction of Monks Mound began early in the 900s CE in present day southern Illinois. By around 1050 the area had grown into a major hub of commerce and agriculture now known as Cahokia. With a population that may have exceeded 40,000 at its peak, Cahokia was the largest urban center north of the great Mesoamerican cities of Mexico and Central America. In the 13th century, for reasons still debated by scholars, the city began to decline, and it was abandoned around 1350. Excavations in the 19th and 20th century revealed a society far more sophisticated and complex than many had believed existed north of Mesoamerica previously.

> Native American Heritage Month celebrates the rich traditions, languages, and stories of Native American, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and Island communities.  Public schools are encouraged to enhance student understanding of Native Americans by providing classroom instruction focusing on Indigenous history, achievements, and contributions, while many government institutions make efforts to recognize the contributions of the first Americans.

> While not everyone would recognize this as an olive tree, most of us understand the meaning of the phrase 'extending an olive branch,' long known as a gesture of peace and friendship. That sentiment of compassion, harmony, and wisdom is at the heart of UNESCO's World Olive Tree Day, created in 2019 and observed every November 26. The intent of the day is to bring attention to the resolution of conflict worldwide and to the preservation of the olive tree itself, like this one standing in front of the Temple of Concordia in Agrigento, Italy. The well-preserved, Greek Doric temple was built on what is now the south shore of Sicily, around 440 BCE. Olive trees are native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and are cultivated today in places with similar climates, like parts of California and Israel. About 90% of harvested olives are used to make olive oil, the quintessential ingredient in Mediterranean cooking.
> 
> The cultivation of olives is about as old as human civilization itself, as are some of the trees themselves. Although olive trees do not grow very tall, usually no more than 30 feet, they live a very long time. One of the oldest known trees in the world, in Portugal, is believed to be 3,350 years old. Many live for millennia, their trunks growing thick and gnarled, and their branches bearing fruit century after century. As civilizations rise and fall around them, these hardy trees remain resilient and steadfast.

<summary>Description</summary>

> No doubt your eyes are drawn to the large, silver-bluish leaf in today's photo, but there's a little more to this colorful display. We're on the floor of a Mexican rainforest to examine a large Cecropia leaf and some lobster claw petals. The genus called Cecropia contains some of the most recognizable neotropical trees anywhere, but the roughly 60 different species can be hard to tell apart. All Cecropias grow fast, by tree standards anyway. On average, they'll climb about 2.5 feet per year and under perfect conditions can grow as much as 10 feet in that time, eventually reaching around 60 feet tall. When dried, Cecropia leaves shrivel into a fist-like form which displays interesting patterns and shapes. Not only are Cecropias very popular with animals like sloths, monkeys, and toucans for their fruit and leaves, many species have a symbiotic relationship with Azteca ants. Cecropias provide shelter and food for ants, and the ants in turn defend the trees from plant-eating predators.
> 
> The other striking leaves here are cup-shaped flower petals of the hanging lobster claw plant, or what botanists call the Heliconia rostrata. With its bright colors and distinctive shape, the lobster claw is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for tropical gardens. Gardeners looking to attract birds love the Heliconia because its plentiful nectar draws hummingbirds to its downward-facing flowers. Those same flowers have special recognition in Bolivia as 'patujú,' the national flower, which appears on one of the country's flags.

> About 140 million miles away from Earth, the most relatable planet in the solar system orbits the sun. Mars, popularly known as the Red Planet, is the fourth planet from the sun, after Mercury, Venus, and Earth. We know more about Mars than any other planet but our own. That knowledge has been gained over centuries and has grown exponentially in recent years with the successful landings on Mars of the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers in 2012 and 2021 respectively. Today we celebrate those and other accomplishments on Red Planet Day, which coincides with the launch of Mariner 4, the first probe sent to Mars, on this day in 1964.
> 
> Mars was observed in ancient times as a bright and moving object in the night sky, distinct from the stars. Even its reddish tint was observed by the naked eye. Our curiosity was cemented.  It might not be the planet closest to ours—Venus owns that title—but it seems to be the planet that most captures our imagination. The more we learn, the more we can imagine that Mars might have been just like Earth a long time ago, possessing organic life, rivers and oceans, and a much thicker atmosphere than it does today. Current conditions on Mars, while not exactly habitable, are hospitable by comparison to those on other planets, maybe the most compelling reason we're inclined to imagine that living on the Red Planet might someday be possible.
