> Towering temples, moss-covered ruins, and enchanting forests can all be found in the ancient site of Angkor in Cambodia, once the center of the powerful Khmer Empire. Pictured on our homepage is the North Gate of Angkor Thom, the 'Great City' within Angkor, built in the 12th century. Strolling through Angkor Thom's intricate ruins, gates, and Bayon Temple, with its 216 gigantic smiling stone faces, is like stepping into an adventure movie. Angkor's star attraction, Angkor Wat, is the world's largest religious monument—spread across 402 acres—and a masterpiece of Khmer architecture. It was initially constructed as a Hindu temple before becoming a Buddhist site. So, if you're looking for a blend of history, art, and nature, this UNESCO World Heritage Site guarantees an unforgettable journey into the past.

> In the heart of the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya, cheetahs reign as the sprinting champions of the wildlife kingdom. With speeds up to 70 miles per hour, cheetahs thrive on the open savanna, always on alert for signs of prey. While the Maasai Mara is known for its exceptional East African cheetah population, globally the species' survival is threatened by habitat loss and human influence. Today, which is both International Cheetah Day and Wildlife Conservation Day, let's raise awareness about the cheetah's plight. It's a day to appreciate the beauty and importance of not just these wild cats, but all wildlife that shares the world with us.

Neuschwanstein Castle, on the left of our homepage image, was commissioned by King Ludwig II of Bavaria. Building work began in 1869 on this Romanesque Revival palace with its fairy-tale-like architecture and breathtaking mountain backdrop. Across the valley, gazing out over Lake Alpsee, is the equally spectacular Hohenschwangau Castle, built by Ludwig II's father, King Maximilian II of Bavaria.

> On the morning of December 7, 1941, American history changed forever when a surprise attack was launched on the US Naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Japanese bombers and submarines struck the island of Oahu, taking the lives of 2,403 Americans and damaging or destroying over 300 airplanes and nearly 20% of the 100-ship Pacific Fleet. The United States entered World War II immediately after the attack, and the event hastened Hawaii's path to become the 50th state to join the union. As 82 years have passed, few veterans of Pearl Harbor are still alive today. Lou Conter, the last surviving crew member of the USS Arizona, its memorial seen here, turned 102 in September. So, thank you to Lou, and all others who served our country on that infamous day.

> Just off the coast of Normandy, France lies Jersey, a British island with a Norse name. Found on the southeastern shore of the island is La Rocque Harbour, home to a white, sandy beach and an elevated walkway that stretches out into the water. The shoreline's granite and plutonic rocks, which originated more than 420 million years ago, showcase a variety of colors and textures. Visible from the harbor are the round, stubby Icho Tower and the taller Seymour Tower, built in the 18th and 19th centuries respectively as coastal defense structures. Both structures are over 1,800 feet away from the shore and can be reached on foot with a sturdy pair of shoes, but only on the days of the year where the tide is lowest.

Vast sand dunes, rocky plateaus, and occasional oases create a landscape like no other. Although it is the largest hot desert in the world, the Sahara supports drought-resistant plants like acacia and palm trees, and hardy animals such as camels and fennec foxes. Intriguing features include its shifting sand dunes, pictured in today's image, some of which are over 500 feet high. Ancient rock art and fossils have also been discovered here, providing insights into early civilizations and prehistoric creatures.

The plant was introduced to the US by Joel Roberts Poinsett, a botanist and former minister to Mexico who died on this day in 1851. Poinsettias can be found growing in the wild from Mexico to Guatemala. The ancestors of the modern, commercially available version have been traced to the Mexican state of Guerrero.

> Among their feathered friends, Bohemian waxwings cut striking figures with their pointed crests, 'blushing' faces, and velvety gray plumage with splashes of color. Large groups wander across the northern US and Canada in search of food, swooping on trees and shrubs to find fruit. In winter, they feast upon cotoneaster, juniper, and rowan berries. As spring casts its spell, these nomads settle down for the breeding season. The female waxwings craft the nests, laying two to six bluish-gray eggs, and hatchlings are fed a diet of insects and fruits by both parents. One can easily spot these sociable birds, as they often gather in chirpy flocks in North America and Eurasia.

> Carved by time, wind, and water, Capitol Reef National Park showcases rust-hued cliffs and the natural beauty of the American West. The park was named after a series of Navajo sandstone domes said to resemble the US Capitol Building and the Waterpocket Fold, a huge ridge in the Earth's crust, which was referred to as a reef by prospectors. This 100-mile-long monocline—a step-like fold—is thought to have formed around 50 to 70 million years ago, and is home to towering cliffs, narrow canyons, and colorful rock formations. Capitol Reef was established as a national monument in 1937 and was designated a national park on December 18, 1971.

> From early December, the streets and squares of Warsaw, Poland's capital city, are dressed for the festive season. Christmas decorations light up the Royal Route, which extends south from the Royal Castle on Castle Square, where a nearly 30-foot-tall Christmas tree is installed for the holiday season, to Wilanów Palace. Bundled patrons wander through Warsaw's Christmas Market, browsing through seasonal souvenirs while savoring a warm beverage. The Royal Castle and surrounding Old Town have been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1980.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Val Gardena in Northern Italy is a popular destination for skiing, rock climbing, and woodcarving enthusiasts, which transforms into Christmas Valley at this time of year. Wooden huts open their doors to visitors, and a nostalgic cable car ride, each cabin adorned with twinkling fairy lights, travels above snow-covered slopes. During the 18th century, the valley became famous for its production of intricately carved wooden figurines, initially made to decorate Catholic churches. Among those creations, the peg wooden doll emerged as one of Val Gardena's best-known products and is still being produced today.

> Frost-covered birch trees add a graceful touch to this winter landscape in the German state of Bavaria. This region is home to the villages of Uffing and Schöffau, on the shores of Staffelsee lake, and is often covered in mist and snow, creating an ethereal ambience. A winter chill is to be expected today, on the shortest day of the year. Typically falling on December 21, the solstice marks the beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere. While we're wrapping up warm, the Southern Hemisphere is celebrating the start of summer on their longest day of the year.

<summary>Description</summary>

> What a lovely city! The Slavic word 'ljub' means 'to love,' and it's right there in the name of Slovenia's capital city, Ljubljana, and the Ljubljanica River that runs through it. This relatively small capital, with a population of just under 300,000, grew up on a trade route connecting the northern Adriatic Sea and the Danube region. While modern buildings skirt the city's periphery, its core preserves historic structures, some of which date back to ancient Rome. The Ljubljana Castle, pictured in the center of today's homepage image, has towered over the city for 900 years. Other sights include the Triple Bridge, the Dragon Bridge, and the historic Old Town. Keep an eye out while you stroll around; you might encounter the city's symbol, the Ljubljana Dragon.

> Family time during the holidays isn't always harmonious. Sometimes you might be tempted to channel this chinstrap penguin and give your nearest and dearest an earful. If you need a break from all the seasonal joy, Festivus might be the holiday for you. The idea was popularized in a 'Seinfeld' episode, which detailed the Costanza family's December 23 traditions, including putting up an unadorned aluminum Festivus pole and airing their year-end personal grievances. Since the episode debuted in 1997, Festivus has taken on a life of its own both among fans and people looking for an alternative way to celebrate the season. While most embrace the trappings of the holiday season, Festivus is for the rest of us.
