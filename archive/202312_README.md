> Towering temples, moss-covered ruins, and enchanting forests can all be found in the ancient site of Angkor in Cambodia, once the center of the powerful Khmer Empire. Pictured on our homepage is the North Gate of Angkor Thom, the 'Great City' within Angkor, built in the 12th century. Strolling through Angkor Thom's intricate ruins, gates, and Bayon Temple, with its 216 gigantic smiling stone faces, is like stepping into an adventure movie. Angkor's star attraction, Angkor Wat, is the world's largest religious monument—spread across 402 acres—and a masterpiece of Khmer architecture. It was initially constructed as a Hindu temple before becoming a Buddhist site. So, if you're looking for a blend of history, art, and nature, this UNESCO World Heritage Site guarantees an unforgettable journey into the past.

> Vermilion Cliffs National Monument in Arizona features sandstone rock formations, towering hoodoos, and surreal slot canyons. The monument, established in 2000, was named after the vibrant red hues that dominate this sandstone landscape. Once you get a permit to take part in this outdoor excursion, make sure to visit the 'Wave.' It's a stunning geological wonder, with flowing layers of rocks that look like red liquid that has been frozen in time. Other visual treats include Cobra Arch and the White Pocket rock formations, featuring swirling patterns in white, red, and orange.

> In the heart of the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya, cheetahs reign as the sprinting champions of the wildlife kingdom. With speeds up to 70 miles per hour, cheetahs thrive on the open savanna, always on alert for signs of prey. While the Maasai Mara is known for its exceptional East African cheetah population, globally the species' survival is threatened by habitat loss and human influence. Today, which is both International Cheetah Day and Wildlife Conservation Day, let's raise awareness about the cheetah's plight. It's a day to appreciate the beauty and importance of not just these wild cats, but all wildlife that shares the world with us.
