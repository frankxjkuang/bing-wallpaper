> Towering temples, moss-covered ruins, and enchanting forests can all be found in the ancient site of Angkor in Cambodia, once the center of the powerful Khmer Empire. Pictured on our homepage is the North Gate of Angkor Thom, the 'Great City' within Angkor, built in the 12th century. Strolling through Angkor Thom's intricate ruins, gates, and Bayon Temple, with its 216 gigantic smiling stone faces, is like stepping into an adventure movie. Angkor's star attraction, Angkor Wat, is the world's largest religious monument—spread across 402 acres—and a masterpiece of Khmer architecture. It was initially constructed as a Hindu temple before becoming a Buddhist site. So, if you're looking for a blend of history, art, and nature, this UNESCO World Heritage Site guarantees an unforgettable journey into the past.
