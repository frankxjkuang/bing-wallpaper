> Towering temples, moss-covered ruins, and enchanting forests can all be found in the ancient site of Angkor in Cambodia, once the center of the powerful Khmer Empire. Pictured on our homepage is the North Gate of Angkor Thom, the 'Great City' within Angkor, built in the 12th century. Strolling through Angkor Thom's intricate ruins, gates, and Bayon Temple, with its 216 gigantic smiling stone faces, is like stepping into an adventure movie. Angkor's star attraction, Angkor Wat, is the world's largest religious monument—spread across 402 acres—and a masterpiece of Khmer architecture. It was initially constructed as a Hindu temple before becoming a Buddhist site. So, if you're looking for a blend of history, art, and nature, this UNESCO World Heritage Site guarantees an unforgettable journey into the past.

The monument, established in 2000, was named after the vibrant red hues that dominate this sandstone landscape. Once you get a permit to take part in this outdoor excursion, make sure to visit the 'Wave.' It's a stunning geological wonder, with flowing layers of rocks that look like red liquid that has been frozen in time. Other visual treats include Cobra Arch and the White Pocket rock formations, featuring swirling patterns in white, red, and orange.

> In the heart of the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya, cheetahs reign as the sprinting champions of the wildlife kingdom. With speeds up to 70 miles per hour, cheetahs thrive on the open savanna, always on alert for signs of prey. While the Maasai Mara is known for its exceptional East African cheetah population, globally the species' survival is threatened by habitat loss and human influence. Today, which is both International Cheetah Day and Wildlife Conservation Day, let's raise awareness about the cheetah's plight. It's a day to appreciate the beauty and importance of not just these wild cats, but all wildlife that shares the world with us.

> The Bavarian Alps, a mountain range in southern Germany, are home to these enchanting 19th-century castles, Neuschwanstein and Hohenschwangau. Neuschwanstein Castle, on the left of our homepage image, was commissioned by King Ludwig II of Bavaria. Building work began in 1869 on this Romanesque Revival palace with its fairy-tale-like architecture and breathtaking mountain backdrop. Across the valley, gazing out over Lake Alpsee, is the equally spectacular Hohenschwangau Castle, built by Ludwig II's father, King Maximilian II of Bavaria. These two castles boast rich interiors with intricate artwork and historical artifacts. Both castles attract millions of visitors every year, offering a glimpse into the opulent past of Bavaria.

> On the morning of December 7, 1941, American history changed forever when a surprise attack was launched on the US Naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Japanese bombers and submarines struck the island of Oahu, taking the lives of 2,403 Americans and damaging or destroying over 300 airplanes and nearly 20% of the 100-ship Pacific Fleet. The United States entered World War II immediately after the attack, and the event hastened Hawaii's path to become the 50th state to join the union. As 82 years have passed, few veterans of Pearl Harbor are still alive today. Lou Conter, the last surviving crew member of the USS Arizona, its memorial seen here, turned 102 in September. So, thank you to Lou, and all others who served our country on that infamous day.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Just off the coast of Normandy, France lies Jersey, a British island with a Norse name. Found on the southeastern shore of the island is La Rocque Harbour, home to a white, sandy beach and an elevated walkway that stretches out into the water. The shoreline's granite and plutonic rocks, which originated more than 420 million years ago, showcase a variety of colors and textures. Visible from the harbor are the round, stubby Icho Tower and the taller Seymour Tower, built in the 18th and 19th centuries respectively as coastal defense structures. Both structures are over 1,800 feet away from the shore and can be reached on foot with a sturdy pair of shoes, but only on the days of the year where the tide is lowest.
