> Every March, as we celebrate Women's History Month, we honor the trailblazing women who've shaped our world. Central to this legacy is the suffrage movement—a courageous fight for women's right to vote.
> 
> Since the founding of the United States, voting rights had largely been restricted to men. It was only in the early 19th century that the fight for women's suffrage took root, alongside the movement to abolish slavery. Women like Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, pictured here, spearheaded efforts to challenge societal norms that denied political participation based on gender. The Seneca Falls Convention of 1848 marked a pivotal moment, where the Declaration of Sentiments boldly stated that 'all men and women are created equal.' Following decades of activism, including rallies, marches, and relentless petitioning, the 19th Amendment was ratified in 1920, finally granting women the right to vote. Beyond securing voting rights, the suffrage movement became a powerful catalyst for broader discussions on gender equality, inspiring future generations to continue the fight for justice.
