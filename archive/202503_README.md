> Every March, as we celebrate Women's History Month, we honor the trailblazing women who've shaped our world. Central to this legacy is the suffrage movement—a courageous fight for women's right to vote.
> 
> Since the founding of the United States, voting rights had largely been restricted to men. It was only in the early 19th century that the fight for women's suffrage took root, alongside the movement to abolish slavery. Women like Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, pictured here, spearheaded efforts to challenge societal norms that denied political participation based on gender. The Seneca Falls Convention of 1848 marked a pivotal moment, where the Declaration of Sentiments boldly stated that 'all men and women are created equal.' Following decades of activism, including rallies, marches, and relentless petitioning, the 19th Amendment was ratified in 1920, finally granting women the right to vote. Beyond securing voting rights, the suffrage movement became a powerful catalyst for broader discussions on gender equality, inspiring future generations to continue the fight for justice.

> Today, we are in New South Wales, Australia, amid the Blue Mountains National Park. Known for its dramatic cliffs, dense rainforests, and cascading waterfalls, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is a treasure trove of natural beauty and biodiversity. Among the most iconic features of the Blue Mountains region are the eucalyptus trees, pictured here. Home to 92 species of eucalyptus, this area offers visitors a chance to marvel at these resilient trees, which are central to Australian wildlife. Their aromatic leaves provide food for koalas, while their bark and canopy create habitats for countless birds and insects.
> 
> Also nestled within the mountains is the Megalong Valley. Just a 2-hour drive from Sydney, this region is home to getaway cabins, wineries, and the Megalong Valley Tearooms, a charming retreat where you can enjoy freshly baked scones paired with local jams. Here, you can also explore the Six Foot Track, a historic trail originally carved in the 19th century for horseback riders. The Blue Mountains promise an unforgettable escape into the heart of Australia's wild beauty.

> What better time to shine a spotlight on nature than on World Wildlife Day? This day serves as a reminder that wildlife conservation is a shared responsibility. This year's theme is 'Wildlife Conservation Finance: Investing in People and Planet.' The events emphasize exchanging ideas, presenting solutions, and diving into how innovative finance can help stop biodiversity loss and create a more sustainable future. Schools, conservation groups, and wildlife parks host events such as nature walks, workshops, art contests, wildlife photography competitions, and conservation talks to raise awareness.
> 
> One species worth learning about is the southern yellow-billed hornbill, pictured here, a bird found throughout Southern Africa and commonly spotted in Kruger National Park in South Africa. Recognizable by its curved, bright yellow bill, this bird is often seen hopping on the ground in search of food. Its diet includes insects, seeds, fruits, berries, nuts, and small reptiles, making it a key player in the ecosystem as both a predator and seed disperser. Social creatures, these hornbills are usually found in pairs or small groups, often foraging together. Their calls—whistling, grunting, and cackling—echo across the savanna.

> Mardi Gras, or 'Fat Tuesday,' is a vibrant tradition that marks the last day of indulgence before the Christian season of Lent begins on Ash Wednesday. Rooted in ancient Roman celebrations like Saturnalia, Mardi Gras evolved as Christianity spread, blending local customs—most notably Carnival festivities—with religious observances. The name itself originates from French, with the word gras meaning 'fat,' referring to rich, fatty foods like meat, eggs, and cheese that are traditionally enjoyed before the fasting season begins.
> 
> New Orleans is synonymous with Mardi Gras, a tradition celebrated there since the 18th century. Today, colorful parades, masked revelers, and iconic krewes define the city's celebration. Jackson Square, in the French Quarter, featured in today's image, stands as a witness to these lively traditions. Established in the early 1800s, it remains a central spot for visitors to experience the energy of Mardi Gras. The official colors of Mardi Gras—purple for justice, green for faith, and gold for power—were set by Rex Krewe in 1872. Whether you're eating king cake or marveling at the floats, Mardi Gras is an unforgettable cultural spectacle.

Established in 1980, the park is home to diverse wildlife, including the Malayan tapir, white-handed gibbon, gaur, and hornbill, making it an ideal destination for anyone ready to swap city noise for jungle sounds. There are trails to tackle, kayaks to paddle, and, if you're fortunate, you might even catch a glimpse of the massive (and stinky) Rafflesia flower when it's in bloom.

Over time, the lake transformed the landscape into something you'd think was straight out of a movie, as featured in today's image. Here, limestone cliffs rise dramatically from glassy waters, and there are floating bungalows too. These bungalows offer more than just a place to sleep—they provide a front-row seat to nature's theater.

> Nature's desert navigators—desert bighorn sheep—are a marvel to watch, effortlessly scaling cliffs and navigating rocky terrains with grace. Native to North America, these sheep are known for their distinctive curled horns, which can weigh up to 30 pounds. Rams use their massive horns in intense head-butting contests. During these battles, they hurl themselves at each other in charges of up to 20 miles per hour. Ewes, on the other hand, tend to keep things more low-key, forming smaller groups with their lambs. Adapted to the desert environment, the desert bighorn sheep sub-species can go long periods without water, relying on moisture from plants to survive.
> 
> Valley of Fire State Park, seen in today's image, is one of the best spots in Nevada to observe these desert dwellers. This park is named for its fiery red sandstone formations that seem to glow under the sun. Beyond its natural beauty, the park holds deep historical significance, with petroglyphs left by ancient Indigenous peoples. It has also earned a place in pop culture as a filming location for scenes from 'Star Trek Generations.' Keep an eye on the rocky outcrops during your visit—you might spot a bighorn sheep observing you.

> Happy International Women's Day, everyone! It's a global celebration of resilience, rights, and remarkable women. First observed in the early 1900s, the day traces its roots to labor movements led by women fighting for better pay, improved working conditions, and voting rights. From its beginnings in 1911, when over a million people attended rallies in Europe, the day has grown into a worldwide movement. Today, it's marked by events, protests, and campaigns addressing issues like gender pay gaps, domestic violence, and access to education. From trailblazers like Marie Curie, who illuminated science, to Malala Yousafzai, who champions education, women have proven time and again that they don't just participate; they innovate.

> It's the time of year again when clocks spring forward, stealing an hour of sleep but giving us longer evenings to enjoy. Daylight saving time (DST) starts today at 2 AM, except in Arizona and Hawaii, reminding us that time, quite literally, waits for no one. The idea is simple: maximizing daylight and reducing energy consumption by syncing our activities with the natural light cycle. This concept was popularized by Benjamin Franklin in the 18th century, though his suggestion to 'save candles' was more satirical than a serious proposal. Fast-forward to the early 20th century, when many countries adopted DST to conserve fuel during wartime. The US officially standardized it in 1966 with the Uniform Time Act. Today, DST runs from March to November in around 70 countries, giving eight months of extended evening light.

> Feeling a bit tired? You're not alone—losing an hour to daylight saving time can leave anyone groggy. That's why Napping Day exists. Introduced in 1999 by William Anthony, a Boston University professor, and his wife, Camille, this unofficial holiday encourages everyone to take quality naps. Observed on the Monday after clocks spring forward, it's a reminder that rest is essential for well-being. Research backs it up—short naps boost mood, enhance concentration, and sharpen memory. Napping is also linked to lower stress and better heart health. While power naps (20-30 minutes) are ideal for a quick recharge, even a few minutes of shut-eye can help.
> 
> In Uganda's Queen Elizabeth National Park, some lions take napping to new heights—quite literally. The tree-climbing lions of the Ishasha Sector have a habit of sprawling across the branches of giant fig trees, as seen in today's image. Experts believe they climb to escape ground-level heat or pesky insects, but these naps make for an unforgettable sight. This vast park spans volcanic craters, open plains, and dense forests. A safari here promises encounters with Uganda's incredible wildlife.

> If you're a lover of history with a dash of drama, the Château de Sully-sur-Loire, in the center of northern France, has you covered. This fortress has seen it all—battles, power shifts, and royal connections. Originally built in the 14th century, the medieval castle was designed to guard the Loire River and control access to the region. Over time, it evolved into a residence for nobility, most notably serving as the home of Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully, who was a trusted minister of King Henry IV. The castle played a significant role during the French Wars of Religion from 1562 to 1598 and has witnessed countless moments of intrigue and diplomacy. In 1940, during World War II, the castle wall was hit by shells, creating massive holes, but the framework remained intact.
> 
> Today, after multiple restorations, the castle welcomes visitors eager to uncover its history. It also stands as an example of French Renaissance architecture. Visitors can explore the imposing towers, thick stone walls, and the beautiful moat that once protected the castle from invaders. The restored interiors feature authentic furniture and artifacts, offering a window into medieval life. Guided tours provide insights into the castle's role in shaping regional and national history. Beyond the stone walls, the surrounding park is an inviting space for explorers to unwind and take in the views of the Loire River.

> Calculating the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is as easy as pi. Today is Pi Day, an event that celebrates this mathematical constant. This date was chosen because 3, 1, and 4 are the first three significant figures of pi (π) when it is written out. Pi is an irrational number, which means that it can't be written as a fraction. When written out, its decimal representation goes on infinitely without repeating. The oldest attempts to calculate pi date back to ancient Babylon and Egypt, around 1900 BCE.
> 
> Pi Day, however, has more recent origins. In the 1980s, physicist Larry Shaw organized the first celebration, where staff at a San Francisco science museum walked around in circles and then ate the number's delicious homophones: pies. Today's image takes us to Álava, northern Spain. The circular motion of the stars appears above the Dolmen of Sorginetxe, an ancient megalithic monument dating back to 3000 BCE. Pi has long played a key role in the study of the stars, and some of the most accurate early approximations of the number were calculated by Indian and Persian astronomers.
