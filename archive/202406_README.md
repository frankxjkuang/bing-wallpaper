> June is Pride Month, commemorating the Stonewall uprising, a series of protests by the LGBTQIA+ community that took place on June 28, 1969, in response to a police raid at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village in New York City. Various events around the world are held in June to honor and celebrate the LGBTQIA+ community, their history, achievements, and ongoing pursuit for equality. This month, vibrant parades hit the streets, and buildings light up in the colors of the rainbow—a symbol of the LGBTQIA+ social movements—in numerous cities to praise freedom for all. Today's homepage shows the skyline of San Francisco, home to one of the largest and oldest Pride parades, with City Hall lit up in rainbow lights.
