> June is Pride Month, commemorating the Stonewall uprising, a series of protests by the LGBTQIA+ community that took place on June 28, 1969, in response to a police raid at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village in New York City. Various events around the world are held in June to honor and celebrate the LGBTQIA+ community, their history, achievements, and ongoing pursuit for equality. This month, vibrant parades hit the streets, and buildings light up in the colors of the rainbow—a symbol of the LGBTQIA+ social movements—in numerous cities to praise freedom for all. Today's homepage shows the skyline of San Francisco, home to one of the largest and oldest Pride parades, with City Hall lit up in rainbow lights.

> It's time to grab a trowel, roll up your sleeves, and get planting: National Gardening Week is starting today! Taking place in the first full week of June, this event was created by the National Garden Clubs, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the joys of horticulture. First celebrated in 1987 this week is all about getting more people involved in gardening and spreading awareness of how important gardens are. Being home to a wide range of trees, flowers, shrubs, and grasses, gardens can help the environment by absorbing carbon dioxide, filtering water, and encouraging insect life. Gardening clubs across the country celebrate this week by organizing workshops, visiting public gardens, or placing plants at public facilities. They're also great for people; tending to a garden is good exercise, and being outside in the sunshine is a great way to get more vitamin D. Gardening can even boost your mood, helping you to feel more relaxed and peaceful.

> Bicycles are the best! An environmentally friendly form of transportation that is affordable and good for your health. Once you learn to ride, you'll never forget how to wheel around. Thanks to Polish American scientist Leszek Sibiliski's initiative, the United Nations declared June 3 World Bicycle Day in 2018.
> 
> Karl von Drais, a German inventor, is credited with developing the first two-wheeler, known variously as the laufmaschine, draisine, and vélocipède, in 1817. It certainly needed some further thinking, since the wooden frame and wheels didn't have pedals. The modern versions of bikes were developed in the late 1800s, but the materials used for them are constantly evolving to make the ride easier and more secure. So, hop on a bike to find your crew on World Bicycle Day!

> It's not just a name. Chestnut-headed bee-eaters spend their days swooping after stinging insects. As well as bees, they also feast on wasps, hornets, and other bugs. The birds in today's image are in Bardia National Park in Nepal, but they're found across many other South Asian countries, from India and Bangladesh to Sri Lanka and Thailand. They catch their prey in mid-flight, returning to a perch where they beat insects to stun them and remove the stinger, which makes them safe to eat. These birds are designed to hunt: Their dazzling green plumage helps camouflage them in dappled jungle light, their curved beak is perfect for picking off insects with precision, and their eyes can move individually, which makes them all the better for spotting bees.

> Happy World Environment Day! First celebrated back in 1973, this UN event is now celebrated in more than 143 countries. This year's theme focuses on land restoration, desertification, and drought resilience.
> 
> Pictured here is Madagascar's Masoala National Park, part of the Rainforests of the Atsinanana UNESCO World Heritage Site. This park, which covers nearly 930 square miles, is a wildlife haven harboring hundreds of species including mammals like red ruffed lemurs and aye-ayes, birds like red owls and helmet vanga, reptiles like Madagascar day geckos and tomato frogs, and butterflies, coral species, fish, and sea turtles. The park has been at the forefront of conservation efforts to combat illegal logging, particularly of its rare rosewood trees. So, let's take inspiration from Masoala and champion the planet that cradles us all. After all, there is no planet B.
