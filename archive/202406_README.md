> June is Pride Month, commemorating the Stonewall uprising, a series of protests by the LGBTQIA+ community that took place on June 28, 1969, in response to a police raid at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village in New York City. Various events around the world are held in June to honor and celebrate the LGBTQIA+ community, their history, achievements, and ongoing pursuit for equality. This month, vibrant parades hit the streets, and buildings light up in the colors of the rainbow—a symbol of the LGBTQIA+ social movements—in numerous cities to praise freedom for all. Today's homepage shows the skyline of San Francisco, home to one of the largest and oldest Pride parades, with City Hall lit up in rainbow lights.

> It's time to grab a trowel, roll up your sleeves, and get planting: National Gardening Week is starting today! Taking place in the first full week of June, this event was created by the National Garden Clubs, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the joys of horticulture. First celebrated in 1987 this week is all about getting more people involved in gardening and spreading awareness of how important gardens are. Being home to a wide range of trees, flowers, shrubs, and grasses, gardens can help the environment by absorbing carbon dioxide, filtering water, and encouraging insect life. Gardening clubs across the country celebrate this week by organizing workshops, visiting public gardens, or placing plants at public facilities. They're also great for people; tending to a garden is good exercise, and being outside in the sunshine is a great way to get more vitamin D. Gardening can even boost your mood, helping you to feel more relaxed and peaceful.

> Bicycles are the best! An environmentally friendly form of transportation that is affordable and good for your health. Once you learn to ride, you'll never forget how to wheel around. Thanks to Polish American scientist Leszek Sibiliski's initiative, the United Nations declared June 3 World Bicycle Day in 2018.
> 
> Karl von Drais, a German inventor, is credited with developing the first two-wheeler, known variously as the laufmaschine, draisine, and vélocipède, in 1817. It certainly needed some further thinking, since the wooden frame and wheels didn't have pedals. The modern versions of bikes were developed in the late 1800s, but the materials used for them are constantly evolving to make the ride easier and more secure. So, hop on a bike to find your crew on World Bicycle Day!

<summary>Description</summary>

> It's not just a name. Chestnut-headed bee-eaters spend their days swooping after stinging insects. As well as bees, they also feast on wasps, hornets, and other bugs. The birds in today's image are in Bardia National Park in Nepal, but they're found across many other South Asian countries, from India and Bangladesh to Sri Lanka and Thailand. They catch their prey in mid-flight, returning to a perch where they beat insects to stun them and remove the stinger, which makes them safe to eat. These birds are designed to hunt: Their dazzling green plumage helps camouflage them in dappled jungle light, their curved beak is perfect for picking off insects with precision, and their eyes can move individually, which makes them all the better for spotting bees.

> Happy World Environment Day! First celebrated back in 1973, this UN event is now celebrated in more than 143 countries. This year's theme focuses on land restoration, desertification, and drought resilience.
> 
> Pictured here is Madagascar's Masoala National Park, part of the Rainforests of the Atsinanana UNESCO World Heritage Site. This park, which covers nearly 930 square miles, is a wildlife haven harboring hundreds of species including mammals like red ruffed lemurs and aye-ayes, birds like red owls and helmet vanga, reptiles like Madagascar day geckos and tomato frogs, and butterflies, coral species, fish, and sea turtles. The park has been at the forefront of conservation efforts to combat illegal logging, particularly of its rare rosewood trees. So, let's take inspiration from Masoala and champion the planet that cradles us all. After all, there is no planet B.

> Eighty years ago, on the beaches of Normandy, northern France, an event unfolded that would alter the course of history. The day was June 6, 1944, a date forever etched in time as D-Day. It marked the launch of Operation Overlord, the ambitious Allied invasion that became a turning point in World War II. The audacious assault by sea, air, and land involved nearly 160,000 troops.
> 
> Today, on this 80th anniversary, we are featuring Les Braves, a sculpture that pays tribute to the courageous troops who landed here. One such symbol is Les Braves, a sculpture gracing Omaha Beach. French artist Anilore Banon's design features three sections called 'Wings of Hope,' 'Rise, Freedom!,' and 'Wings of Fraternity.' In addition, across the ocean in Michigan, its twin, 'Les Braves II: At Water's Edge,' resonates with the same spirit at The War Memorial. These sister sculptures stand as guardians of memory, inviting a moment of silence from a world that benefited from the bravest of the brave.

> Today, let's embark on a watery adventure as we celebrate World Oceans Day. This day is about honoring and protecting the world's oceans and serves as a reminder of the critical role oceans play in supporting life on Earth. These gargantuan water bodies, after all, teem with wonders, from the tiniest plankton to the grandest whales like the humpbacks we see here. The oceans also produce almost half of the oxygen on our planet thanks to the photosynthesis of plankton—tiny plants, algae, and bacteria. Moreover, they absorb a significant amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping mitigate the impacts of climate change caused by human activities.
> 
> Oceans face many threats, including rising sea temperatures thanks to global warming, plastic pollution, and ocean acidification, which threatens many marine species. The theme for this year's World Oceans Day is 'Awaken New Depths.' This motto encourages us to delve deeper into the ocean's complexities and take urgent actions to ensure that these fascinating, ocean-dwelling animals continue to grace our planet for generations to come. So, are you ready to take the plunge?

> The lush greenery of June is here, and so is National Rivers Month, a 30-day tribute to the veins of our planet that was created by Canadian activist Mark Angelo. Just like the confluence featured here today, where Alaska's Easter Creek and Killik River unite in a beautiful display, we too come together every year to help preserve the nation's rivers. With increasing threats such as pollution, habitat destruction, and overuse, it's more important than ever to advocate for the protection of our waterways. Whether you're paddling down a gentle stream, casting a line for some fishing fun, or simply enjoying a leisurely stroll along the riverbank, there are countless ways to connect with these flowing wonders. The US alone boasts a vast network of over 250,000 rivers that stretches more than 3 million miles across diverse terrains. Which one are you heading to?

> In the heart of Japan, where the past and future intertwine, lies a city pulsating with life and culture—Osaka. Traditionally an economic hub, Osaka has twice served briefly as the imperial capital, once in the 7th and once in the 8th century. It flourished culturally during the Edo period (1603–1867) and became a major industrial center after the Meiji Restoration in1868, which restored imperial rule to Japan.
> 
> Known as the 'Nation's Kitchen,' Osaka boasts a culinary scene that tantalizes taste buds with dishes like takoyaki, a ball-shaped fried cake stuffed with chopped octopus, and okonomiyaki, a savory pancake loaded with cabbage, meat, and various toppings. But the city's charm isn't just in its gastronomic delights. Step into the past's embrace at Osaka Castle, a majestic relic of Japan's rich history and a symbol of unwavering resilience. Wander through the gardens of Shitenno-ji Temple, one of the oldest Buddhist temples in the country and an oasis of tranquility amidst the bustling city. Explore Dōtonbori, a district known for its dazzling neon billboards, including the famous Glico Running Man and the towering mechanized crab sign of Kani Dōraku restaurant. Every corner of Osaka is a journey through time and flavors.

> Horns up, heads high! Featured here is a group of gemsboks, a large antelope, reigning over the sprawling savannas in southwestern Africa. Indigenous to the arid territories of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and parts of Zimbabwe, they thrive mainly within the Kalahari and Namib Deserts. They can survive in extremely dry conditions and can go without water for weeks, getting moisture from the food they eat. Moreover, gemsboks are adept runners, achieving speeds of up to 37 miles per hour. Their distinguishing trait is their notably elongated, straight horns. Although both genders possess these formidable defenses, the females' horns tend to be slightly longer and sleeker while the males' horns are thicker with broader bases. So, if you ever find yourself in the sandy plains of the Kalahari, keep an eye out for these desert gems.

This park is the largest protected area in the Chihuahuan Desert, covering over 1,250 square miles. The Big Bend State Park was established on June 12, 1944, when the state of Texas transferred this land to the federal government.
> 
> Within the park lie not only historic landmarks like the Castolon Historic District and the Hot Springs Historic District, but also the footprints of modern pioneers, ranchers, and miners. This land is also one of North America's premier destinations for stargazing. The absence of human activity in the surrounding regions results in low-level light pollution and some of the darkest night skies in the area. Bring your binoculars along and enjoy an evening full of Milky Way vistas, meteor showers, star sightings, and taking pictures of the stunning night sky.

> Wave our national symbol today; it's Flag Day! On June 14, 1777, by resolution of the Second Continental Congress, the nation's first official flag was approved. Throughout US history, the flag's design has changed. In its current arrangement, the 13 stripes represent the original colonies, and the stars stand for the states. The flag was last modified in 1960 when Hawaii became a state, and the number of white stars on a blue background increased from 49 to 50.
> 
> Some states have always celebrated the adoption of the Stars and Stripes with parades or by displaying the national flag in their homes; however, the official observance of Flag Day dates back to 1949, thanks to legislation passed by President Harry Truman. On the 75th anniversary of the national commemoration, we wish our flag to fly high!
