> 1956年，商人兼自然保护主义者劳伦斯·洛克菲勒看到了加勒比海美属维尔京群岛之一圣约翰岛的美景，并意识到必须保护它。时间快进到今天，我们正在庆祝维尔京群岛国家公园成立68周年。这座公园占地约60%的岛屿和5,650英亩的水下土地，是一个活生生的保护范例，这还要归功于洛克菲勒向美国政府捐赠了5,000多英亩的土地。即使在2017年飓风“厄玛”和“玛丽亚”造成破坏之后，公园仍然强势回归，仅2018年就接待了超过10万名游客。公园里有800多种植物，如野生罗望子和世纪树，140种鸟类，如绿颈鹑鸠和绿喉蜂鸟，以及大约50种珊瑚。在礁湾小径上，徒步旅行者可以看到古老的泰诺岩画和甘蔗种植园遗址，展示了该岛的殖民历史。从图中树干湾的水下浮潜小径到马霍湾满是海龟的水域，公园提供了各种各样的海洋冒险活动。

> In 1956, businessman and conservationist Laurance Rockefeller saw the beauty of St. John, one of the US Virgin Islands in the Caribbean, and knew it had to be preserved. He donated more than 5,000 acres of land to the National Park Service, and today we're marking the 68th anniversary of Virgin Islands National Park. Covering about 60% of St. John and 5,650 acres of submerged lands, the park boasts stunning white-sand beaches, coral reefs, and historic sites.

> Carved by nature over centuries, the Three Natural Bridges tower over a deep gorge in Wulong Karst. This part of China is known for its karst landscape, which includes towering arches, extensive caves, and other rock formations. These limestone bridges are named after three dragons: Tianlong (Sky Dragon), Heilong (Black Dragon), and Qinglong (Azure Dragon), which is the tallest at 922 feet. Visitors can explore the mossy gorge beneath and the wider Wulong Karst National Geology Park, including the 9,337-foot Furong Cave with its huge limestone stalactites.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we're at Molokini Crater. This pleasant crescent in the Pacific Ocean lies in the 'Alalākeiki Channel between the Hawaiian islands of Maui and Kaho'olawe. The islet is all that remains of a volcano that erupted about 230,000 years ago. According to Hawaiian mythology, Pele the fire goddess was in love with a man named Mo'o. The trouble was that Mo'o was in love with another woman. Pele's revenge was typically violent: She cut her rival in two, her body becoming Molokini, while her head became Pu'u Olai, a cinder cone on Maui.
> 
> Molokini Crater these days is a prime scuba and snorkeling destination; the islet's crescent shape protects divers from waves and currents, allowing them to enjoy the reef. This habitat is home to at least 250 species of fish, including black triggerfish and parrotfish, as well as 38 species of hard coral, and some 100 species of algae. So, come on in, the water's lovely. Just be sure not to anger Pele.

> Could you win a staring contest with this spotted owlet? These primarily nocturnal owls are sometimes mobbed during the day by birds trying to defend their territory from predators. With their piercing yellow eyes, the small owls will stare down intruders, bob their heads, and emit a loud 'chirurrr-chirurrr-chirurrr' screech, sometimes likened to laughter or chuckling.
> 
> Standing around 8 inches tall, speckle-plumed spotted owlets can be found from Iran to Vietnam. This one was photographed in Bangkok, Thailand. They eat insects and small mammals like bats and mice, which they often store to eat later when food is scarce. Spotted owlets flourish in various environments, from semi-deserts, rocky areas, and forests to farmlands and urban areas. While they aren't endangered, the spotted owlet's population is thought to have declined, perhaps owing to loss of habitat and increased urbanization.

> Today we are celebrating the heritage and culture of native populations worldwide. There are some 5,000 Indigenous cultures in 90 countries around the world, from Samoa and Greenland to New Zealand and Nepal. One of the major challenges they face is the loss of their languages: It's estimated that of the 4,000 Indigenous languages in the world, around 2,600 are in danger of becoming extinct.
> 
> In the city of Cusco, Peru, the stone walls of Sacsayhuamán, seen in today's image, murmur tales of the mighty Inca civilization. The Quechua word Sacsayhuamán means 'the place where the hawk is satisfied.' The citadel's walls, which extended over 1,000 feet, were built in the 15th century CE. The boulders used to make them were carved and placed without mortar. After the Inca Empire was defeated at a battle here in 1536, Sacsayhuamán was dismantled by the Spanish and the rest of the structure was covered in earth. It was rediscovered in 1934 when the site was excavated. On this day, let's learn the importance of preserving Indigenous cultures and wisdom, as we honor the Indigenous peoples.

> California's Joshua Tree National Park has a history that began way before it was made a national monument on August 10, 1936. Located where the Mojave and Colorado Deserts meet, it has been home to various cultures for thousands of years. Its earliest known residents were people from the Pinto Culture, who lived here from 8000 to 4000 BCE. Centuries later, this land was inhabited by the native Cahuilla, Serrano, and Chemehuevi peoples. The park's namesake, the Joshua tree, grows in a landscape covering 1,242 square miles. Despite their name, they are not really trees, but rather a kind of succulent. Native to southwest US and northern Mexico, they can grow up to 40 feet tall.

> Today, Joshua Tree National Park invites adventurers to explore its terrain. Whether it's hiking through Hidden Valley, visiting the Cholla Cactus Garden, or marveling at Skull Rock, this national park has a lot to offer.

> From mythology to movies, lizards have often been portrayed as scary reptiles. But they're not as dangerous as stories might lead you to believe. World Lizard Day is the perfect time to learn about these cold-blooded creatures. With more than 7,000 species, lizards have adapted to a wide range of environments—from deserts to rainforests. Take geckos—these little climbers have toe pads that let them scale walls and walk on ceilings. Then there are chameleons with their color-changing skin. While many think it's all about blending in, this ability is also used to communicate and regulate temperature.
> 
> Now let's focus on the peculiar creature in today's image, trekking across the arid landscape of Australia's Watarrka National Park. Meet the thorny devil, also known as the thorny dragon or moloch. With clever hydrophilic skin that channels moisture to its mouth, this reptile can hydrate just from the dew on its body. This allows it to thrive in extreme desert conditions where others would perish. On World Lizard Day, let's take a moment to appreciate these scaly wonders of the animal kingdom.

> In 1991, logger Hồ Khanh stumbled upon something big in what is now Vietnam's Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park. During a jungle expedition, he found the entrance to a cave with a roaring underground river. It was later named Hang Sơn Đoòng, or 'cave of the mountain river' and in 2009, the British Cave Research Association led an expedition to explore it. They realized something incredible: It was the world's largest cave. Hang Sơn Đoòng's main passage is 3.1 miles long, 490 feet wide, and 660 feet high. That's tall enough to fit a 40-story skyscraper.
> 
> Inside the cave, there is a 200-foot calcite barrier called the 'Great Wall of Vietnam' and stalagmites stretching as tall as 260 feet. It even has its own weather system; clouds form inside due to temperature differences between the cave air and the outside air. Moreover, an underground river links Hang Sơn Đoòng to the nearby Hang Thung cave, suggesting undiscovered depths. Given its fragile ecosystem, strict regulations are in place to preserve Hang Sơn Đoòng's pristine condition. Tours of the cave are limited to 1,000 visitors per year.

> From single rails to virtual reality, roller coasters have been thrilling people for centuries. Their origins can be traced back to 17th-century Russia, where wooden slides—'Russian Mountains'—provided seasonal entertainment. The first roller coaster was built in early 19th-century Paris, France. Called 'Les Montagnes Russes à Belleville,' it featured wheeled carts securely attached to tracks. By the 1900s, coasters were looping the loop for the first time.
> 
> Pictured here is a hybrid coaster that combines wood and steel—Hakugei, the White Whale of Japan in Nagashima Spa Land. Once known as White Cyclone, this beast underwent a transformation in 2019. The ride's wooden track was replaced with steel. Its metamorphosis not only revved up its velocity and propelled it to new heights but also introduced gravity-defying inversions. So, if you find yourself in Japan, brave the Hakugei—buckle up and take the plunge, and emerge with a tale as epic as the ride itself.

> The lighthouse featured in today's image stands in southern Portugal's popular Algarve region. Built in 1919, Alfanzina Lighthouse helps ships navigate dangerous waters near the town of Carvoeiro. A popular tourist destination, the lighthouse also has become a symbol of the region's deep links to the sea. If you're lucky enough to live near a lighthouse, this weekend is the perfect time to pay it a visit.
> 
> Today marks the start of International Lighthouse and Lightship Weekend, celebrating this vital maritime infrastructure. Originally, lighthouses were powered by fires and oil lamps, requiring lighthouse keepers to maintain them. These days, however, most lighthouses have been automated and installed with electric light sources. In waters that are too deep or otherwise unsuitable to build a lighthouse, lightships—moored vessels outfitted with beacon lights—have often been used.
