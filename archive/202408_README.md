> 1956年，商人兼自然保护主义者劳伦斯·洛克菲勒看到了加勒比海美属维尔京群岛之一圣约翰岛的美景，并意识到必须保护它。时间快进到今天，我们正在庆祝维尔京群岛国家公园成立68周年。这座公园占地约60%的岛屿和5,650英亩的水下土地，是一个活生生的保护范例，这还要归功于洛克菲勒向美国政府捐赠了5,000多英亩的土地。即使在2017年飓风“厄玛”和“玛丽亚”造成破坏之后，公园仍然强势回归，仅2018年就接待了超过10万名游客。公园里有800多种植物，如野生罗望子和世纪树，140种鸟类，如绿颈鹑鸠和绿喉蜂鸟，以及大约50种珊瑚。在礁湾小径上，徒步旅行者可以看到古老的泰诺岩画和甘蔗种植园遗址，展示了该岛的殖民历史。从图中树干湾的水下浮潜小径到马霍湾满是海龟的水域，公园提供了各种各样的海洋冒险活动。

<summary>Description</summary>

> In 1956, businessman and conservationist Laurance Rockefeller saw the beauty of St. John, one of the US Virgin Islands in the Caribbean, and knew it had to be preserved. He donated more than 5,000 acres of land to the National Park Service, and today we're marking the 68th anniversary of Virgin Islands National Park. Covering about 60% of St. John and 5,650 acres of submerged lands, the park boasts stunning white-sand beaches, coral reefs, and historic sites.
> 
> On the Reef Bay Trail, hikers can see ancient Taino petroglyphs and old sugar plantation ruins, showcasing the island's colonial past. From an underwater snorkeling trail in Trunk Bay, pictured here, to Maho Bay's turtle-filled waters, the park offers a diverse array of marine adventures.

> Carved by nature over centuries, the Three Natural Bridges tower over a deep gorge in Wulong Karst. This part of China is known for its karst landscape, which includes towering arches, extensive caves, and other rock formations. These limestone bridges are named after three dragons: Tianlong (Sky Dragon), Heilong (Black Dragon), and Qinglong (Azure Dragon), which is the tallest at 922 feet. Visitors can explore the mossy gorge beneath and the wider Wulong Karst National Geology Park, including the 9,337-foot Furong Cave with its huge limestone stalactites. Standing beneath these magnificent natural bridges, you can't help but be humbled by the sheer power of time and nature.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we're at Molokini Crater. This pleasant crescent in the Pacific Ocean lies in the 'Alalākeiki Channel between the Hawaiian islands of Maui and Kaho'olawe. The islet is all that remains of a volcano that erupted about 230,000 years ago. According to Hawaiian mythology, Pele the fire goddess was in love with a man named Mo'o. The trouble was that Mo'o was in love with another woman. Pele's revenge was typically violent: She cut her rival in two, her body becoming Molokini, while her head became Pu'u Olai, a cinder cone on Maui.
> 
> Molokini Crater these days is a prime scuba and snorkeling destination; the islet's crescent shape protects divers from waves and currents, allowing them to enjoy the reef. This habitat is home to at least 250 species of fish, including black triggerfish and parrotfish, as well as 38 species of hard coral, and some 100 species of algae. So, come on in, the water's lovely. Just be sure not to anger Pele.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Amid dusky hues, lighthouses mark where a Great Lake meets a river. Two piers were built on Lake Michigan, one either side of the mouth of the St. Joseph River to help protect ships sailing upstream. In the early 20th century, a lighthouse was built at the end of each pier; the St. Joseph North Pier Inner and Outer Lights, pictured here.
> 
> Congress designated August 7 as National Lighthouse Day in 1989 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Lighthouse Act and to celebrate these iconic structures. Lighthouses not only mark hazards, and safe entries to harbors; these striking buildings also add a touch of romance to coastal scenes and shine a light onto our maritime history.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Could you win a staring contest with this spotted owlet? These primarily nocturnal owls are sometimes mobbed during the day by birds trying to defend their territory from predators. With their piercing yellow eyes, the small owls will stare down intruders, bob their heads, and emit a loud 'chirurrr-chirurrr-chirurrr' screech, sometimes likened to laughter or chuckling.
> 
> Standing around 8 inches tall, speckle-plumed spotted owlets can be found from Iran to Vietnam. This one was photographed in Bangkok, Thailand. They eat insects and small mammals like bats and mice, which they often store to eat later when food is scarce. Spotted owlets flourish in various environments, from semi-deserts, rocky areas, and forests to farmlands and urban areas. While they aren't endangered, the spotted owlet's population is thought to have declined, perhaps owing to loss of habitat and increased urbanization.
