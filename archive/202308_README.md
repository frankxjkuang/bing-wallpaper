<summary>Description</summary>

> Today is National Mountain Climbing Day, dedicated to celebrating the sport while highlighting its many risks and rewards. In a bid to scale the tallest peaks and conquer difficult terrain around the world, mountain climbers embark on physically strenuous journeys that demand exceptional training and experience. But the panoramic views and sense of achievement after reaching the summit makes the effort worthwhile. Our image today is that of Denali, North America's highest peak at 20,310 feet, in south-central Alaska. The name 'Denali' means 'the high one' in the native Athabascan language. Four climbers, Walter Harper, Harry Karstens, Robert Tatum, and Hudson Stuck, were the first to set foot on the top of the mountain in 1913.

> Behold the rugged grandeur of Utah's red rock country. This hidden gem of the American Southwest is Capitol Reef National Park, a tapestry of towering cliffs, twisting canyons, colorful sandstone buttes, and sweeping desert landscapes. Less popular than Zion and Bryce Canyon, the park offers a pleasantly uncrowded experience for visitors keen to enjoy this spectacular landscape. It is also home to a wide variety of plants and animals, including the elusive desert bighorn sheep and more than 230 bird species. But its crown jewel is the nearly 100-mile long Waterpocket Fold, a 7,000-foot-high step in the rock layers, officially known as a monocline. This massive wrinkle on the surface of the planet was formed around 50 to 70 million years ago.

> Experience nature's palette at its colorful best at Zelenci Springs, where Italy, Austria, and Slovenia meet, and multiple springs combine to form this aquamarine lake. Here in Slovenia’s Triglav National Park, these crystal-clear waters are the source of the Sava Dolinka, which runs into the country’s longest river, the Sava. Peer closely at the lakebed and you will see tiny springs bubbling up beneath the water's surface. These spring waters never freeze as underground water temperatures stay around 41 degrees Fahrenheit, enough to keep flowing through harsh winters in this alpine region.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Set deep in a gorge of the UK's River Wye, Tintern Abbey has an enduring presence. Originally built in wood, this Gothic masterpiece in Monmouthshire, Wales, was rebuilt in stone in 1269. It was in use for centuries until the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1530s, when Henry VIII broke with the Catholic Church. The building fell into ruin but, as the centuries passed, word of its intricate stones and romantic, pastoral setting spread. From painter J. M. W. Turner to poet William Wordsworth, many artists were drawn to the abbey over the years. This majestic ruin is now a national icon on the Welsh bank of the River Wye, on the border between Wales and England. There's another abbey in County Wexford, Ireland, of the same name. Back in olden days, the one in Wales was often known as 'Tintern Major,' while the Ireland one was called 'Tintern de Voto' (Tintern of the Vow).

<summary>Description</summary>

> Meet the Atlantic puffin! Known as 'sea parrots' or 'clowns of the sea,' about 60% of all Atlantic puffins nest on the coasts of Iceland. If you visit between June and September, you might see baby puffins being flung off a cliff. Do not be alarmed! It's part of puffling season, a yearly tradition on Iceland's Westman Islands, home of the largest puffin colony in the world. Residents search with a flashlight for lost or wayward pufflings—baby puffins—around cliffs, harbors, and the seaside area. They pick them up with gloved hands, take them to a cliff before sundown, and toss them over the edge. Why? Well, the lights of the town can confuse pufflings, who use the light of the moon and stars to guide them to the ocean, where they live for much of the year. Residents are simply doing their part to ensure they find their way to their natural habitat.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Happy National Lighthouse Day! A beacon, a warning, and a symbol of hope and home, lighthouses have existed for thousands of years. The earliest known was the Pharos of Alexandria, which stood an estimated 330 feet tall. Built by the ancient Egyptians in the 3rd century BCE, an open fire was lit at its highest part to guide ships into port. Illumination technology advanced over the centuries, culminating in today's electric versions beaming light that can be seen from over 20 miles away. North Carolina's Bodie Island Lighthouse, pictured here, was built in 1872 and overlooks a section of ocean once known as the Graveyard of the Atlantic. Since then, it's been doing its best to outshine the stars above, as it guides sailors home to safe harbor.

<summary>Description</summary>

> This looping highway in Taipei bears a resemblance to the symbol of infinity—the concept of something without ends or limits that is celebrated today. Infinity Day is held on the eighth day of the eighth month, a nod to the symbol's likeness to a sideways figure-of-eight. Established in 1987 by a New York-based philosopher, Jean-Pierre Ady Fenyo, the day celebrates freedom of thinking in its various forms, from philosophy through the arts and sciences. The symbol itself has a much longer history. English mathematician John Wallis is credited with introducing it as a mathematical symbol in 1655. The philosophical concept of infinity dates back at least as far as ancient Greece.
> 
> Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, was founded in the 18th century. The city might seem remote due to its location at the northern tip of the island, but Taipei's industrial activity encouraged the construction of impressive highways and public transport systems. Its green areas and nature preserves are equally remarkable, creating an extraordinary aerial view of the parks and roads in surprising shapes.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Lions are known as 'the king of the jungle,' but on World Lion Day, let's set the record straight: Lions don't live in the jungle. Lions lounge in lordly leisure and hunt with ferocious focus on grasslands and plains. When they're not hunting, these majestic creatures nap, wrestle, and groom each other. But in an instant, they're chasing down a hapless gazelle or a hippopotamus that's wandered too far from the safety of its river. Like the opening song of 'The Lion King' movie says, it's the circle of life. World Lion Day is our opportunity to (ahem) lionize these regal beasts and raise awareness of threats to their well-being like poaching, habitat destruction, and other human-lion conflicts.

> These giants are the largest land animals on Earth, African bush elephants, which can reach 13 feet in shoulder height and weigh as much as 11 tons. They are one of three living species of elephant, alongside their smaller relatives, the African forest elephant and the Asian elephant. Their immense size is not the only incredible thing about them. Studies suggest that elephants can recognize themselves in the mirror and that these mammals display emotions such as grief when they lose family members. World Elephant Day—held on August 12—was set up to admire them but also to highlight the difficulties they face. Amboseli National Park in Kenya—where this photograph was taken—is one of the few remaining habitats where African elephant herds can still be found in large numbers.

> What must our ancestors have thought when they saw meteors light up the night sky? Was it terrifying or an event of wonder? Thankfully, we now know that this celestial cascade is a harmless annual event. The Perseid meteor shower thrills stargazers from mid-July to late August and is due to peak today. The Perseids are caused by Earth passing through debris left behind by the Comet Swift-Tuttle. When the cosmic debris hits our atmosphere, it disintegrates in a colorful, fiery light display. It's a good night to catch the Perseids if you can—the moon is projected to only be 10% illuminated, so the meteors should really stand out against the dark sky.

> Once upon a time, there lived a wealthy industrialist, Henry Flagler, who embarked on the herculean task of creating an overseas railway connecting mainland Florida to Key West. When it opened in 1912, it was dubbed the Eighth Wonder of the World. However, the triumph was short-lived. It was hit by a hurricane on Labor Day, 1935 and the railroad discontinued operations. The railway was sold to the US government and rebuilt as an automobile highway, opening in 1938.
> 
> These days, the Overseas Highway still stretches about 113 miles through the Florida Keys over 42 bridges, which jump from island to island over the Atlantic Ocean, Florida Bay, and the Gulf of Mexico. Many of the original bridges were replaced in 1982, including the longest, the Seven Mile Bridge pictured in the distance in our homepage image. Drivers crossing the Overseas Highway can still see remnants of some of the old bridges running alongside their replacements, including the Old Seven Mile Bridge, a section of which was renovated for cyclists and pedestrians. An engineering marvel, the ‘highway that goes to sea' has also featured in blockbusters like 'License to Kill' and 'True Lies.'

> We're looking at sequoia trees in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, California—the two parks border each other in the Sierra Nevada range in Central California. These giant sequoias can grow nearly 300 feet tall and some specimens have lived more than 3,000 years. Their longevity—even in areas prone to wildfires—is helped by thick bark that's full of fire-resistant tannins.

> These stunning stone spires, rising from the forest in China's Hunan province, are said to have inspired the floating mountains of the movie 'Avatar.' There are more than 3,000 of these quartz-sandstone pillars in Zhangjiajie National Forest Park, often swathed in mist, part of a spectacular landscape that has inspired generations of painters. These days, they are popularly known as the 'Avatar Mountains' and one, the 3,544-foot-high Southern Sky Pillar, was officially renamed as 'Avatar Hallelujah Mountain' in 2010, the year after the blockbuster movie was released.
> 
> The spires sit within the wider Wulingyuan Scenic and Historic Interest Area, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and attract millions of tourists each year who come to marvel at their otherworldly beauty. The park is dotted with numerous hiking trails and glass-bottomed skywalks, allowing visitors to enjoy panoramic views of this natural wonder.

> On August 19, 1839, French artist and photographer Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre made public his invention that created an image using a silver-plated copper sheet and mercury vapor. The daguerreotype process became the first publicly available photographic process and was used throughout the 1840s and 1850s.
> 
> Today, August 19 is World Photography Day, promoting the art as a means of storytelling, creative expression, and cultural preservation. The world of photography is vast and captures many subjects and styles on camera, from abstract and fashion photography to landscapes and wildlife, like this cheeky squirrel here. Some seek to keep the charm and artistry of old-fashioned photography alive, though digital cameras and smartphones give everyone the opportunity to capture great photos, sometimes in unexpected places.
