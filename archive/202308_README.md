> Today is National Mountain Climbing Day, dedicated to celebrating the sport while highlighting its many risks and rewards. In a bid to scale the tallest peaks and conquer difficult terrain around the world, mountain climbers embark on physically strenuous journeys that demand exceptional training and experience. But the panoramic views and sense of achievement after reaching the summit makes the effort worthwhile. Our image today is that of Denali, North America's highest peak at 20,310 feet, in south-central Alaska. The name 'Denali' means 'the high one' in the native Athabascan language. Four climbers, Walter Harper, Harry Karstens, Robert Tatum, and Hudson Stuck, were the first to set foot on the top of the mountain in 1913.

> Behold the rugged grandeur of Utah's red rock country. This hidden gem of the American Southwest is Capitol Reef National Park, a tapestry of towering cliffs, twisting canyons, colorful sandstone buttes, and sweeping desert landscapes. Less popular than Zion and Bryce Canyon, the park offers a pleasantly uncrowded experience for visitors keen to enjoy this spectacular landscape. It is also home to a wide variety of plants and animals, including the elusive desert bighorn sheep and more than 230 bird species. But its crown jewel is the nearly 100-mile long Waterpocket Fold, a 7,000-foot-high step in the rock layers, officially known as a monocline. This massive wrinkle on the surface of the planet was formed around 50 to 70 million years ago.

> Experience nature's palette at its colorful best at Zelenci Springs, where Italy, Austria, and Slovenia meet, and multiple springs combine to form this aquamarine lake. Here in Slovenia’s Triglav National Park, these crystal-clear waters are the source of the Sava Dolinka, which runs into the country’s longest river, the Sava. Peer closely at the lakebed and you will see tiny springs bubbling up beneath the water's surface. These spring waters never freeze as underground water temperatures stay around 41 degrees Fahrenheit, enough to keep flowing through harsh winters in this alpine region.

> Set deep in a gorge of the UK's River Wye, Tintern Abbey has an enduring presence. Originally built in wood, this Gothic masterpiece in Monmouthshire, Wales, was rebuilt in stone in 1269. It was in use for centuries until the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1530s, when Henry VIII broke with the Catholic Church. The building fell into ruin but, as the centuries passed, word of its intricate stones and romantic, pastoral setting spread. From painter J. M. W. Turner to poet William Wordsworth, many artists were drawn to the abbey over the years. This majestic ruin is now a national icon on the Welsh bank of the River Wye, on the border between Wales and England. There's another abbey in County Wexford, Ireland, of the same name. Back in olden days, the one in Wales was often known as 'Tintern Major,' while the Ireland one was called 'Tintern de Voto' (Tintern of the Vow).

> Meet the Atlantic puffin! Known as 'sea parrots' or 'clowns of the sea,' about 60% of all Atlantic puffins nest on the coasts of Iceland. If you visit between June and September, you might see baby puffins being flung off a cliff. Do not be alarmed! It's part of puffling season, a yearly tradition on Iceland's Westman Islands, home of the largest puffin colony in the world. Residents search with a flashlight for lost or wayward pufflings—baby puffins—around cliffs, harbors, and the seaside area. They pick them up with gloved hands, take them to a cliff before sundown, and toss them over the edge. Why? Well, the lights of the town can confuse pufflings, who use the light of the moon and stars to guide them to the ocean, where they live for much of the year. Residents are simply doing their part to ensure they find their way to their natural habitat.
