> For the first day of Women's History Month, we've come to the Capitol Rotunda in Washington, DC, to view the Portrait Monument, which depicts three founding mothers of the 19th-century women's rights movement. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and Susan B. Anthony are particularly known for their efforts to gain American women the right to vote.
> 
> Artist Adelaide Johnson sculpted the Portrait Monument in 1920, the same year that US women finally got the vote, and it was unveiled on Feb 15, 1921 in the Rotunda. The next day, it was moved into storage in the Capitol Crypt. Although the move was supposed to be temporary while a permanent home was selected, it would take 76 years and an act of congress before the Portrait Monument was returned to the Rotunda.
