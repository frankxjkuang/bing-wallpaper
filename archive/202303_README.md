<summary>Description</summary>

> For the first day of Women's History Month, we've come to the Capitol Rotunda in Washington, DC, to view the Portrait Monument, which depicts three founding mothers of the 19th-century women's rights movement. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and Susan B. Anthony are particularly known for their efforts to gain American women the right to vote.
> 
> Artist Adelaide Johnson sculpted the Portrait Monument in 1920, the same year that US women finally got the vote, and it was unveiled on Feb 15, 1921 in the Rotunda. The next day, it was moved into storage in the Capitol Crypt. Although the move was supposed to be temporary while a permanent home was selected, it would take 76 years and an act of congress before the Portrait Monument was returned to the Rotunda.

<summary>Description</summary>

> On World Wildlife Day, we're in the ice-cold waters around the Norwegian island of Spildra with a pod of orcas, also known as killer whales. These apex predators are at the top of the food chain with a diet that includes a smorgasbord of sea creatures including fish, penguins, and even sharks and whales. They hunt in pods, family groups of up to 40 individuals that work together using special hunting techniques sometimes likened to packs of wolves. Despite their scary name, they almost never attack humans and there are no documented cases of wild orcas killing anyone. The name 'killer whale' is thought to come from Spanish sailors who saw groups of them hunting big whales. Orcas are also the largest member of the oceanic dolphin family, Delphinidae.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The Icelandic horse is a small, unique breed that arrived alongside the first Norse settlers in this island country sometime between 860 and 935 CE. More than 1,000 years later, they remain purebred thanks to strict regulations prohibiting the importation of horses. And once exported, they can never come back—rules designed to stop the spread of disease.
> 
> They have adapted to their chilly surroundings, wrapped up in thick winter coats that they can shed when it warms up in spring. These sturdy animals are also perfectly at home crossing glacial rivers and rough terrain. Icelandic horses come in many colors and it is said by some that their coats reflects their personality. Celebrated in Norse folklore, they have long been seen as a valuable servant and trusted companion. These horses are usually only ridden after they turn 4 years old  and these days are mainly used for racing, exhibiting in horse shows, sheep-herding, and leisure activities.

> On International Women's Day, we're at Madrid's iconic Cibeles Fountain and City Hall, which have been lit up in purple—one of the day's official colors, representing justice and dignity. Each year, marchers pass by the Great Mother of the Gods on her chariot drawn by lions, as they turn out in their thousands to campaign for gender equality in Spain's capital city.
> 
> International Women's Day has its roots in the US labor movement in the early 20th century. In 1908, 15,000 women marched in New York City for better working conditions and the right to vote and a national women's day was declared in 1909. The following year, German activist Clara Zetkin put forward the idea of holding an international women's day at a conference in Copenhagen. She got unanimous backing and the first one was celebrated on March 19, 1911, in Austria, Denmark, Switzerland, and Germany. It wasn't until 1975 that it was officially recognised by the United Nations.
> 
> These days, International Women's Day is observed on March 8 in many countries around the world, a date to celebrate women's achievements and to continue to campaign for full gender equality.

Built between 1904 and 1906, it was designed by the famous Austrian architects Ferdinand Fellner and Hermann Helmer in the Neo-Baroque style, popular in the late 19th century. This opulent style nodded back to the grandiosity of the Baroque movement, which began in Rome in the 1600s and flourished across Europe.

You remember pi from geometry class—it's the ratio of the distance around a circle to the distance across it. Pi is used to compute a circle's area and circumference.

> Giant pandas are loved the world over but nowhere more than in China, where they are considered national treasures. On March 16, we celebrate these distinctive bears, which live mainly in forests in the mountains of western China and subsist almost entirely on a diet of bamboo. These black-and-white giants start off small—a newborn panda is about the size of a stick of butter—but after eating their way through between 26 and 84 pounds of bamboo a day, male adults can weigh in at up to 300 pounds.
> 
> China's Chengdu Panda Base, pictured on our homepage, houses one of the world's largest populations of giant pandas bred in captivity. Their journey started with six rescued giant pandas in the 1980s, and the base is now home to about 150 of these beautiful animals. In the wild, panda numbers are rebounding after years of decline thanks to conservation efforts. The species has been upgraded from 'endangered' to 'vulnerable' but they still require our help—and events like Panda Day—to raise awareness of the need to protect these loveable giants.

> For St. Patrick's Day, we're enjoying this stunning rainbow over Ireland's southeast coast. Shamrocks, parades, and all things green will be the order of the day as we celebrate the patron saint of the Emerald Isle. While many countries recognize the holiday today, the first celebration was held in Ireland more than 1,000 years ago, remembering the 5th-century missionary and bishop credited with bringing Christianity to the country.
> 
> Our homepage image shows a jewel of Ireland's spectacular southeast coastline, Copper Coast Geopark, a UNESCO site in County Waterford. This magnificent stretch of undulating cliffs and sandy coves is named after the 19th-century copper mines that once operated there. It is dotted with historical sites, including ruined medieval churches, Iron Age forts, and ancient inscribed stones. And, with a little Irish luck, you might just find a pot of gold at the end of that rainbow.

> It would be pretty tough to live on Mars. It's cold, dry, and the conditions are harsh. The planet's average temperature is about –81 degrees Fahrenheit, but it can get as low as –243 at the poles. But with many canyons, extinct volcanoes, and ice caps, it's beautiful to look at from afar. Most photos of the red planet highlight its rusty color, caused by high levels of iron oxide.
> 
> This photo from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is an enhanced-color view of sand dunes and ripples in the Gamboa Crater. 'False color' technology was used to reveal subtle variations of the Martian surface that our eyes wouldn't be able to see on their own. These added details show the effects of wind inside the crater, providing a glimpse of the spectacularly complex features of this planet.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Barn owls, distinguished by their white heart-shaped faces, are one of the world's most widespread birds, found on every continent except Antarctica. They live in woodlands, farms, and on cliffs, but barn owls also enjoy roosting in places like bell towers and barns—hence the name. They are nighttime predators that fly over open lands to hunt rats and mice. During heavy rain, they are unable to hunt because their feathers aren't waterproof, leaving them vulnerable to starvation during long periods of wet weather. Although some see them as a symbol of wisdom and fortune, their haunting cries and ghostly appearance mean they have often been seen as bad omens in rural areas.
