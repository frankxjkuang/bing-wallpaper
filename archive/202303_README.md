> For the first day of Women's History Month, we've come to the Capitol Rotunda in Washington, DC, to view the Portrait Monument, which depicts three founding mothers of the 19th-century women's rights movement. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and Susan B. Anthony are particularly known for their efforts to gain American women the right to vote.
> 
> Artist Adelaide Johnson sculpted the Portrait Monument in 1920, the same year that US women finally got the vote, and it was unveiled on Feb 15, 1921 in the Rotunda. The next day, it was moved into storage in the Capitol Crypt. Although the move was supposed to be temporary while a permanent home was selected, it would take 76 years and an act of congress before the Portrait Monument was returned to the Rotunda.

> On World Wildlife Day, we're in the ice-cold waters around the Norwegian island of Spildra with a pod of orcas, also known as killer whales. These apex predators are at the top of the food chain with a diet that includes a smorgasbord of sea creatures including fish, penguins, and even sharks and whales. They hunt in pods, family groups of up to 40 individuals that work together using special hunting techniques sometimes likened to packs of wolves. Despite their scary name, they almost never attack humans and there are no documented cases of wild orcas killing anyone. The name 'killer whale' is thought to come from Spanish sailors who saw groups of them hunting big whales. Orcas are also the largest member of the oceanic dolphin family, Delphinidae.

> At almost 8,000 feet above sea level, Mount Pico is the highest point in the Azores, a collection of volcanic islands in the Atlantic Ocean that are an autonomous region of Portugal. Back in 1562, an eruption here on Pico Island lasted for more than two years, but this stratovolcano has been lying dormant since 1720.
> 
> These days, Mount Pico is popular with hikers and, at more than twice the height of any other peak in the archipelago, there are stunning views on offer from its peak, for those determined enough to make the climb.

> Each spring, folks across Japan observe 'hanami,' a treasured tradition of viewing nature's breathtaking display of cherry blossoms. Japanese cherry trees, known as 'sakura,' reach full bloom in March in the south of the country. Our homepage picture shows cherry blossoms cascading over the moats which surround the Imperial Palace in Tokyo.
> 
> Blooms progress northward throughout March and April, with the final flowerings gracing the slow-to-thaw Hokkaido prefecture as the season ends. To help people seek out the best displays, the Japanese Meteorological Agency carefully tracks the 'cherry blossom front' across the island nation. This year, the earliest blooms are expected to start flowering in Tokyo on or around March 16.
