> Welcome to 2024! Did you stay up late to ring in the new year? If so, we wouldn't blame you for sleeping in like this red fox in Abruzzo, Italy. Whenever you wake up, New Year's Day is a great opportunity for reflection, planning, and a sense of renewal for the year ahead. January 1 has been a big day since the Julian calendar was widely adopted in 45 BCE—modified in 1582 by the Gregorian calendar to better calculate for leap years. Whether you're watching a parade, attending a sports game, taking a chilly dip, or writing resolutions, we hope it's the beginning of a great year to come.

> This kaleidoscopic column is made up of prayer flags, blowing in the breeze in the Phobjikha Valley, Bhutan. Prayer flags come in five repeating colors representing different elements in nature, blue for the sky, white for air, red for fire, green for water, and yellow for earth. The fluttering fabrics, inscribed with spiritual scripts, are usually raised during times of prosperity, such as on Bhutan's Nyinlong, their traditional day of solstice, which takes place today. As the flags fade over time, adherents believe this signifies that the prayers have been heard and are being carried away by the wind, infusing the surrounding area with positivity and spirituality.

> It's time to bust out the furry feet and pointed ears because today is J.R.R. Tolkien Day, celebrating the literary legend behind 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit.' On January 3, the Tolkien Society toasts 'the professor' on his birthday, echoing Frodo's annual toasts to Bilbo on his birthday each year. Tolkien's roots run through Oxford, where he studied English language and literature and later became a professor. Since 1979, Oxford's Bodleian Library has been home to the Tolkien Archive, a collection of manuscripts, artwork, and even a Middle-earth map with Tolkien's handwritten notes. His legacy is one of timeless fantastical tales that have delighted generations of readers since they were written more than 70 years ago. His stories encourage us to seize each day and make the most of the time that is given to us.

> An iconic feat of engineering, the Golden Gate Bridge stands like a sentinel at the entrance to San Francisco Bay. Pictured here blanketed by fog above the waters of the Golden Gate Strait, its towers, adorned with Art Deco elements, reach a height of 746 feet. The bridge opened in 1937, thanks to the efforts of engineer Joseph Strauss, architect Irving Morrow, and others who wanted to connect San Francisco to Marin County. It wasn't an easy vision to accomplish during the Great Depression, but the investment paid off as its construction created thousands of jobs and boosted growth. It was Morrow who picked the striking color, International Orange, an unusual choice at the time when many bridges were gray or black. He felt it would contrast well with the surrounding hills, sky, ocean, and fog. The Golden Gate Bridge, a testament to human innovation, is a timeless masterpiece blending functionality with beauty.

> Apple Tree Day is a nationwide ode to the art of apple cultivation and the health benefits this beloved fruit brings to our lives. Apples made their way to North America with European colonists in the 17th century. In 1625, the first apple orchard in North America was planted in Boston by William Blaxton. Today, from Red Delicious to Honeycrisp to Pink Lady, some 200 varieties are grown in the US. The chaffinch on our homepage today is pictured amid tiny crab apples. Sure, they can be a bit tart, but they make for a lovely display in winter and some birds depend on them when other food is scarce. Sliced, baked, in a salad, or as cider, how do you like them apples?

This elusive predator prowls around the forests of northern Europe and Siberia and the hills and mountains of Central Asia, often unnoticed by humans. Their low calls can be heard by other lynx, and they are primarily active at night, dawn, and dusk, although they can hunt by day if needed. These solitary hunters have keen senses and remarkable agility, able to climb trees and jump more than 6 feet straight up to catch prey. In temperate forests, they mainly dine out on rabbits, hares, marmots, and other small mammals, although they can take on prey as large as deer.

Named for their loud call, whooper swans are one of the world's heaviest flying birds, weighing up to around 30 pounds and boasting wingspans of between 7 and 9 feet. Whooper swans are found across Eurasia and are Finland's national bird, spending their breeding season there before migrating to warmer areas for winter.

This park covers 93 square miles of the wider forest, where it sits on Germany's border with Czechia. The softly rolling mountains Great Rachel, Little Rachel, and Little Arber pose modest challenges for hikers as they wander through stands of Norway spruce. The forest teems with life, including lynxes, bears, pygmy owls, and Eurasian wolves, like our sleepy homepage friend. These wolves form a close-knit pack led by an alpha pair and have been spotted in the park after decades of being hunted out of Western Europe.

> The 'golden hour' just before sunset is the perfect time to take in views of Paris' most ornate bridge, the Pont Alexandre III. Arching over the Seine, the bridge was opened in 1900 and named after a Russian tsar, celebrating a new alliance between the two countries. Befitting the nobility of the event, two 56-foot columns sit on each bank of the river, crowned with gilt-bronze sculptures of the winged horse Pegasus. From the center of the bridge, standing above reliefs decorated with nymphs and beneath Art Nouveau-style lamps, you can admire some famous Parisian monuments. Views include the Esplanade des Invalides, the Grand Palais and Petit Palais museums, and the Eiffel Tower.

> Why visit one lake when you can visit 16? Plitvice Lakes National Park in Croatia serves up stunning terraced lakes connected to one another by more than 90 cascades and waterfalls, thanks to the unique geology of the area.
> 
> The surrounding mountains funnel water carrying calcium carbonate into the park. This accumulates and hardens over time into a type of limestone called tufa, which creates a series of barriers. These natural dams form pools, with thin, lacy waterfalls leading from one 'lake' to another. This majestic display draws more than a million visitors a year to the paths and boardwalks that wind through the lakes, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Even in winter, the lakes retain their beauty, with once-roaring waterfalls frozen in place.

> Let's flap our flippers and dive into Penguin Awareness Day! Today's image features macaroni penguins swimming in the plankton-rich waters of the Drake Passage off the coast of Chile. These charming creatures, one of 18 different species of penguin in the Southern Hemisphere, can be recognized by their flashy amber crests and orange beaks. The name is said to have been coined by English sailors, derived from a term used to describe flamboyant dressers in the late 18th century.
> 
> Macaroni penguins can be a bad-tempered bunch who get into noisy fights. To avoid this, males often ease their way through crowded colonies with their heads tucked down to their chests. The main threats though, are not their fellow penguins. Reduced food availability, fishing nets, and the impact of climate change on sea ice are among challenges faced by this species, which has been classified as vulnerable due to population decline.

> Have you ever been captivated by a squirrel crossing your path? January 21 is Squirrel Awareness Day, honoring these furry seed distributors. Today's homepage star is the Eurasian red squirrel, whose striking reddish-brown coat, white underbelly, and bushy tail are a familiar sight in several countries. These squirrels are not only exceptional jumpers—capable of leaping up to 6 feet in one jump—they can even swim to search for food. They gather nuts and acorns in the autumn and hide them, to see them through the winter months. If you spot fuzzy-tailed squirrels frolicking in your backyard, they might also appreciate a feeding station stocked with treats such as raspberries or crab apples.

> Step to the western edge of America, where the Walton Lighthouse, also known as the Santa Cruz Breakwater Lighthouse, is a beacon for passing ships. Built in 2002, this 40-foot-tall building replaced a more modest light. The Walton Lighthouse got its name from Charles Walton, a businessman who helped fund its construction in memory of his brother Derek, a merchant seaman who died at sea during World War II.
> 
> Santa Cruz has been a busy port city since the mid-1800s, when ships would unload lime, redwood, and other agricultural products. These days, Santa Cruz Harbor is home to a commercial fishing fleet, as well as a popular place to rent kayaks, boats, and paddleboards.
