> Welcome to 2024! Did you stay up late to ring in the new year? If so, we wouldn't blame you for sleeping in like this red fox in Abruzzo, Italy. Whenever you wake up, New Year's Day is a great opportunity for reflection, planning, and a sense of renewal for the year ahead. January 1 has been a big day since the Julian calendar was widely adopted in 45 BCE—modified in 1582 by the Gregorian calendar to better calculate for leap years. Whether you're watching a parade, attending a sports game, taking a chilly dip, or writing resolutions, we hope it's the beginning of a great year to come.

> This kaleidoscopic column is made up of prayer flags, blowing in the breeze in the Phobjikha Valley, Bhutan. Prayer flags come in five repeating colors representing different elements in nature, blue for the sky, white for air, red for fire, green for water, and yellow for earth. The fluttering fabrics, inscribed with spiritual scripts, are usually raised during times of prosperity, such as on Bhutan's Nyinlong, their traditional day of solstice, which takes place today. As the flags fade over time, adherents believe this signifies that the prayers have been heard and are being carried away by the wind, infusing the surrounding area with positivity and spirituality.

> It's time to bust out the furry feet and pointed ears because today is J.R.R. Tolkien Day, celebrating the literary legend behind 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit.' On January 3, the Tolkien Society toasts 'the professor' on his birthday, echoing Frodo's annual toasts to Bilbo on his birthday each year. Tolkien's roots run through Oxford, where he studied English language and literature and later became a professor. Since 1979, Oxford's Bodleian Library has been home to the Tolkien Archive, a collection of manuscripts, artwork, and even a Middle-earth map with Tolkien's handwritten notes. His legacy is one of timeless fantastical tales that have delighted generations of readers since they were written more than 70 years ago. His stories encourage us to seize each day and make the most of the time that is given to us.
