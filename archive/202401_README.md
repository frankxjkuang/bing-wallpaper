> Welcome to 2024! Did you stay up late to ring in the new year? If so, we wouldn't blame you for sleeping in like this red fox in Abruzzo, Italy. Whenever you wake up, New Year's Day is a great opportunity for reflection, planning, and a sense of renewal for the year ahead. January 1 has been a big day since the Julian calendar was widely adopted in 45 BCE—modified in 1582 by the Gregorian calendar to better calculate for leap years. Whether you're watching a parade, attending a sports game, taking a chilly dip, or writing resolutions, we hope it's the beginning of a great year to come.

> This kaleidoscopic column is made up of prayer flags, blowing in the breeze in the Phobjikha Valley, Bhutan. Prayer flags come in five repeating colors representing different elements in nature, blue for the sky, white for air, red for fire, green for water, and yellow for earth. The fluttering fabrics, inscribed with spiritual scripts, are usually raised during times of prosperity, such as on Bhutan's Nyinlong, their traditional day of solstice, which takes place today. As the flags fade over time, adherents believe this signifies that the prayers have been heard and are being carried away by the wind, infusing the surrounding area with positivity and spirituality.

> It's time to bust out the furry feet and pointed ears because today is J.R.R. Tolkien Day, celebrating the literary legend behind 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit.' On January 3, the Tolkien Society toasts 'the professor' on his birthday, echoing Frodo's annual toasts to Bilbo on his birthday each year. Tolkien's roots run through Oxford, where he studied English language and literature and later became a professor. Since 1979, Oxford's Bodleian Library has been home to the Tolkien Archive, a collection of manuscripts, artwork, and even a Middle-earth map with Tolkien's handwritten notes. His legacy is one of timeless fantastical tales that have delighted generations of readers since they were written more than 70 years ago. His stories encourage us to seize each day and make the most of the time that is given to us.

> An iconic feat of engineering, the Golden Gate Bridge stands like a sentinel at the entrance to San Francisco Bay. Pictured here blanketed by fog above the waters of the Golden Gate Strait, its towers, adorned with Art Deco elements, reach a height of 746 feet. The bridge opened in 1937, thanks to the efforts of engineer Joseph Strauss, architect Irving Morrow, and others who wanted to connect San Francisco to Marin County. It wasn't an easy vision to accomplish during the Great Depression, but the investment paid off as its construction created thousands of jobs and boosted growth. It was Morrow who picked the striking color, International Orange, an unusual choice at the time when many bridges were gray or black. He felt it would contrast well with the surrounding hills, sky, ocean, and fog. The Golden Gate Bridge, a testament to human innovation, is a timeless masterpiece blending functionality with beauty.

From the frozen waters of the Songhua River, they carve more than 2,000 towering ice sculptures including castles, temples, animals, mythical figures, and massive ice slides. The stunning ice creations are illuminated at night in many colors, adding a new dimension to the spectacle.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Apple Tree Day is a nationwide ode to the art of apple cultivation and the health benefits this beloved fruit brings to our lives. Apples made their way to North America with European colonists in the 17th century. In 1625, the first apple orchard in North America was planted in Boston by William Blaxton. Today, from Red Delicious to Honeycrisp to Pink Lady, some 200 varieties are grown in the US. The chaffinch on our homepage today is pictured amid tiny crab apples. Sure, they can be a bit tart, but they make for a lovely display in winter and some birds depend on them when other food is scarce. Sliced, baked, in a salad, or as cider, how do you like them apples?

> These aren't your ordinary rocks! One of the oldest-known religious locations, the Devils Marbles Conservation Reserve is a sacred site to Aboriginal Australians. The site, also called Karlu Karlu, in Australia’s Northern Territory, is home to a collection of giant, gravity-defying boulders. These rocks are composed of granite, and their peculiar shape is the result of millions of years of weathering and erosion.
> 
> And what better occasion than Old Rock Day, to appreciate such geological wonders? Did you know that the Earth's oldest rock is truly out of this world? Lunar sample 14321, or 'Big Bertha,' is approximately 4.46 billion years old—just a smidge younger than the Earth itself—and was recovered from the moon during the Apollo 14 mission. Scientists believe that the rock was a meteorite from Earth that hit the moon, only to be brought back home, millions of years later. Whether you're a geology nerd or just a nature lover, today's the day to rock on!

> Ready for a next-level staring contest? Don’t worry, you're unlikely to come face to face with a Eurasian lynx like this one, padding through the snow on our homepage. This elusive predator prowls around the forests of northern Europe and Siberia and the hills and mountains of Central Asia, often unnoticed by humans. Their low calls can be heard by other lynx, and they are primarily active at night, dawn, and dusk, although they can hunt by day if needed. These solitary hunters have keen senses and remarkable agility, able to climb trees and jump more than 6 feet straight up to catch prey. In temperate forests, they mainly dine out on rabbits, hares, marmots, and other small mammals, although they can take on prey as large as deer.

Forests and ancient temples sit side-by-side in the park, beneath the three granite peaks of Bukhan Mountain, or Bukhansan.
