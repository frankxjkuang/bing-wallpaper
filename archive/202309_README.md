> Labor Day is a well-earned day of rest for many workers across America. The food we eat, the shelter over our heads, and the transportation that moves us around all exist thanks to our collective labor. Organized labor movements grew in the 19th century, along with calls for a day to honor workers' contributions. The first Labor Day was celebrated with a parade in New York City in September 1882 and similar events spread throughout the country. In 1894, President Grover Cleveland signed a bill declaring the first Monday in September as Labor Day. Today, Labor Day marks the unofficial end of summer, but let's not forget to take a moment to give thanks for the work we all put in to take care of our communities, our families, and ourselves.

> Hustai National Park in Mongolia is home to a very special and rare breed, the Przewalski's horse. Regarded by some as the only truly pure wild horse today, it is easily recognized by its pale yellowish-brown coat, a short, stiff mane, and short legs. The Przewalski's horse, also called the 'takhi' in Mongolia, was once extinct in the wild but has been successfully reintroduced through conservation efforts in the 1990s. An interesting fact about these horses is that they have 66 chromosomes, compared with 64 in domestic horses. Remarkably, Przewalski's horses can mate with domestic horses to produce hybrids. These hybrids have 65 chromosomes and can breed and have their own offspring.

> From early Spanish colonialism to modern day civil rights struggles, the timeline of Hispanic and Latino history in the US is a rich one. Hispanic Heritage Month—September 15 to October 15—is dedicated to the history, culture, and heritage grounded in Latin America. It began as Hispanic Week in 1968 and has since evolved into a 30-day celebration. Why does it start in the middle of the month? September 15 sees the first of a series of independence days in several Latin American countries—El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. They are followed by Mexico, Chile, and Belize, which mark theirs on September 16, 18, and 21, respectively.

Dating back all the way to 1810, it began with the wedding of Crown Prince Ludwig, later Ludwig I of Bavaria, and Princess Therese von Sachsen-Hildburghausen. The celebrations took place on the fields in front of the city gates, which were named Theresienwiese, or Theresa's Meadow, in honor of the bride. The festivities lasted for five days, filled with exciting activities such as parades and horse races. It was so popular that Oktoberfest became an annual event that now draws more than 6 million people. This year's festival starts today and lasts 18 days.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The tiny Cuban tody can only be found on Cuba and its neighboring islands. Despite their colorful plumage, including that sparkling green head, their size can make them hard to spot. However, they are easy to hear. The soft sound of 'pprreeee-pprreeee' or a short 'tot-tot-tot-tot' will tell you there's a tody somewhere nearby.
> 
> The species are found around forests, coasts, dry lowlands, and rivers. The Cuban tody on our homepage is in Alejandro de Humboldt National Park, the Caribbean's biggest and best-preserved forested landscape. The park is also one of the most biologically varied tropical island locations on Earth, with a wide range of endemic plants and animals, so our colorful feathered friend is in good company.
