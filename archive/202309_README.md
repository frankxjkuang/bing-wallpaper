> Labor Day is a well-earned day of rest for many workers across America. The food we eat, the shelter over our heads, and the transportation that moves us around all exist thanks to our collective labor. Organized labor movements grew in the 19th century, along with calls for a day to honor workers' contributions. The first Labor Day was celebrated with a parade in New York City in September 1882 and similar events spread throughout the country. In 1894, President Grover Cleveland signed a bill declaring the first Monday in September as Labor Day. Today, Labor Day marks the unofficial end of summer, but let's not forget to take a moment to give thanks for the work we all put in to take care of our communities, our families, and ourselves.
