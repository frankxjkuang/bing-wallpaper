<summary>Description</summary>

> Today, Canada turns another year older. Canada Day is a nod to the moment when the country officially came together in 1867. What began as a confederation of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia has grown into a nation of 10 provinces and 3 territories. Originally called Dominion Day, the name was changed to Canada Day in 1982—the same year the Constitution Act was signed, granting the country full control over its constitution. While Canada Day is not the country's 'Independence Day,' it's the closest thing to it. Canadians celebrate this holiday with fireworks, parades, concerts, and community events. Ottawa, the country's capital, hosts one of the biggest celebrations, featuring music and speeches on Parliament Hill.
> 
> On this day, it is hard to miss how the red and white houses in Tilting mirror the colors of the Canadian flag. Tilting, a village on Fogo Island in Newfoundland and Labrador, was settled by Irish immigrants in the 18th century. It remains a unique example of an Irish outport community that has preserved its cultural identity. The bright fishing sheds and homes weren't painted just for aesthetics; the hues once made buildings easier to spot during heavy fog or snowfall. These vivid colors also reflect the practical, resourceful life of the people who settled here.

<summary>Description</summary>

> That bright fish hiding in the anemone? That's the spine-cheeked anemonefish, or the maroon clownfish, and it is not just a cute creature. Native to the Indo-Pacific, from western Indonesia to Taiwan and the Great Barrier Reef, this species lives on the edges of coral reefs. It is easily distinguished by the spine extending from each cheek—hence the name. Groups of spine-cheeked anemonefish form around a single dominant female, and if she disappears, the top male steps up—literally changing sex to take her place. Spine-cheeked anemonefish thrive in warm, shallow waters and stick close to their chosen sea anemone.
> 
> The closest marine companion of a spine-cheeked anemonefish is the bubble-tip anemone, as seen in the image. These anemones don't all look alike—their appearances often vary with age, depth, and whether they host anemonefish. This species offers the perfect mix of cover and protection. In return, the fish defend the anemone from threats and remove debris from its surface. It's a stable, symbiotic bond that benefits both partners and keeps them closely tied to the same patch of reef.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Nestled in the northern Gulf Coast of Florida, is Rainbow Springs State Park. This area has served as a natural resource for humans and animals for centuries, with the Rainbow River—flowing through the park—playing a major role. The gently winding waterway is fed by Rainbow Springs, one of Florida's largest springs. The water that bubbles up here comes from a 770-square-mile area and eventually flows into the Withlacoochee River.
> 
> The Rainbow River's transparent waters are perfect for swimming and snorkeling, and they maintain a constant temperature of 72°F year-round. The park's history dates to the late 1880s, when hard rock phosphate was discovered in the area, leading to a boomtown era. This period saw the rapid growth of a small community called Juliette near the springs, driven by the phosphate mining industry. During the 1960s, the park emerged as a popular tourist destination, featuring glass-bottom boat rides, a monorail system, and even a rodeo. Today, visitors can explore the ornamental gardens, waterfalls, and walking paths, and enjoy the diverse wildlife that calls Rainbow Springs home.

> The Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes, located near Stovepipe Wells Village in Death Valley National Park, are the most accessible and iconic dunes in the park. They are formed by a combination of eroding mountains to the north that supply sand, prevailing winds that move it, and surrounding mountains that trap it from the south—creating a stunning landscape of rippling sand hills. Named after the resilient mesquite trees that grow here, the dunes offer breathtaking views at sunrise and sunset, as well as exceptional stargazing opportunities.
> 
> Death Valley National Park, spanning more than 3.4 million acres, is the largest national park in the contiguous United States. It is known for its extreme temperatures, vast desert landscapes, and geological diversity. More than 93% of the park is designated wilderness, offering opportunities for backcountry exploration, though visitors must be cautious of hazards like extreme heat, flash floods, and wildlife. Despite its harsh environment, the park is rich in natural beauty and cultural history, including its deep ties to the Timbisha Shoshone people, who have lived in the region for generations.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Graceful, powerful, and impossible to miss—the northern gannet is the largest seabird on the waters of the North Atlantic. It spends most of its time gliding over open seas and returning to land only to breed. These seabirds, known for their vast and noisy breeding colonies, called gannetries, nest on steep cliffs, remote rocky islands, and sea stacks that rise from the ocean.
> 
> Few birds hunt as dramatically as the northern gannet, which dives straight into the sea, as seen in today's image. Spotting prey from heights of up to 100 feet, the bird folds its wings and hits the water at speeds of over 60 mph. Its streamlined body, reinforced skull, and built-in shock absorbers, such as spongy bone plates and air sacs beneath the skin, make these high-impact dives both powerful and safe. Once underwater, the gannet uses its wings and webbed feet to swim after fish, diving as deep as 70 feet and staying submerged for up to 30 seconds. Its forward-facing eyes provide excellent depth perception, while hidden nostrils prevent water from rushing in during those lightning-fast descents.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Italy's Dolomites don't just tower; they enchant, turning every trail into a story. Fondly known as the 'Pale Mountains,' the Dolomites derive their name from dolomite—a carbonate mineral. Set in the northern Italian Alps, the range spans over 345,000 acres and boasts 18 soaring peaks that rise above 9,500 feet. These mountains feature sheer cliffs, lofty walls, and a maze of narrow, winding valleys.
> 
> Amid the dramatic landscape of the Dolomites lies one of its most spectacular peaks, Seceda, featured in today's image. With a height of around 8,200 feet, it offers the highest panoramic viewpoint in Val Gardena, a scenic valley in the province of South Tyrol. A short cable car ride takes you to the summit, bypassing what would otherwise be a strenuous hike. Once at the top, you're greeted by a stunning sweep of the Dolomites' iconic jagged ridgelines. On a clear day, you might even spot Austria's tallest mountain, the Großglockner, located more than 90 miles away.

> Argentina, a nation of sweeping pampas, rich culture, and a bold identity, celebrates its Independence Day today. This pivotal date marks the moment in 1816 when delegates from across the region gathered in the city of San Miguel de Tucumán to declare freedom from Spanish colonial rule. The road to independence was not easy; it followed years of internal struggles and revolutions influenced by global movements, including the American and French revolutions. But the resolve of the Argentine people prevailed.
> 
> Since gaining independence, Argentina has taken important steps in shaping its national identity. The drafting of its first constitution in 1853 established a framework for democratic governance that continues to influence its political system. The country has also made notable contributions to global culture and sports. It has offered the world literary figures like Jorge Luis Borges, a rich culinary tradition centered on asado (a traditional barbecue), and legendary athletes such as Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi. Constitución railway station in Buenos Aires, pictured here, is a historic hub that reflects Argentina's drive for growth, connectivity, and the spirit of unity that emerged during a transformative era.

> The Bahamas comes alive with color, music, and pride today as the nation marks its Independence Day. First recorded by Europeans in 1492 when Christopher Columbus arrived, the islands were initially under Spanish rule. They later came briefly under American control before becoming a British colony. After decades of legal negotiations and a growing push for self-governance, the Bahamas transitioned to full independence on this day in 1973.
> 
> In the lead-up to July 10, Bahamians across the archipelago take part in spirited celebrations, including National Pride Day, ecumenical services, and community walks and runs. These events shine a spotlight on the nation's vibrant culture, heritage, and deep sense of patriotism. And what better backdrop for such festivities than the breathtaking turquoise waters that surround the islands? The shallow, white sandbanks reflect sunlight in a way that gives the ocean its signature electric-blue glow, pictured here. Whether you're snorkeling among coral reefs, watching fireworks from a beachfront, or cruising the Exuma Cays under the golden sun, it seems the ocean sparkles just a little brighter on Independence Day.

> We are living in a full house, and it is getting fuller. With 8.2 billion people and counting, World Population Day highlights how that growth affects cities, food, and the future. First observed in 1989, the day focuses on how unchecked population growth affects sustainability. The event was inspired by Five Billion Day in 1987, which marked the approximate date when the global population hit that milestone. As cities expand, green spaces shrink, and agriculture competes for limited land and water resources. But there is a way forward—investing in education, improving access to healthcare, and building smarter cities can balance growth with sustainability.
> 
> On a global scale, India remains the most populous country in 2025 with over 1.46 billion people, followed by China at 1.41 billion. The United States trails with around 339 million, though its growth is slowing and aging populations are becoming a new challenge. Tokyo, the world's largest city with around 37.2 million people, illustrates the realities of high-density urban life: overcrowded spaces, transport congestion, and rising demand for services. World Population Day is more than a head count—it's a call for better planning and long-term thinking to ensure future generations can thrive on a planet with finite resources.
