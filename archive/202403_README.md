> Every March, we celebrate Women's History Month, a tribute to the generations of women who have shaped our past and are inspiring our present. Today, let's take a moment to highlight a crucial step that was taken for a more representative democracy—the women's suffrage movement. This image shows a sea of determined faces in a 1915 Manhattan suffrage parade. Pioneers like Susan B. Anthony and Lucy Stone spearheaded this effort, which culminated in the historic 19th Amendment in 1920, which granted women the right to vote. Over a hundred years later, women now hold 28% of seats in Congress, a dramatic leap forward from the past and a reminder of progress still to be made.

> When Italy comes to mind, iconic cities like Milan, Rome, and Venice often steal the spotlight. However, on the island of Sicily lies a less famous gem—Modica. It's a city that rose from the rubble of an earthquake in 1693 to become an architectural wonderland of Baroque-style buildings. With fewer than 60,000 inhabitants, this UNESCO World Heritage Site boasts cobbled lanes, echoing with powerful footprints—from prehistoric tribes to the ancient Greeks and Romans to the medieval Arabs and Normans. Landmarks like the San Giorgio Cathedral and San Pietro Church awe visitors with their grandeur, and Modica's famous chocolate, crafted with Aztec-inspired techniques, tempts the palates of food enthusiasts. So, the next time Italy beckons, how about taking the road less traveled to Modica?

> It's time to step into the wild! This year's World Wildlife Day focuses on how advances in digital technology can help to preserve wildlife, for example through research, communication, and DNA analysis. Digital platforms can also be a way to get younger people involved in protecting our planet's animals and plants.
> 
> Today's image shows a leopard perched in the branches of Kruger National Park, South Africa. Leopards are one of the five living species of the genus Panthera, which also includes lions, tigers, jaguars, and snow leopards. Leopards are known for their solitary lifestyle, especially males, who roam their territories almost entirely in seclusion. They are considered vulnerable due to habitat loss, and their numbers are in decline globally. Through conservation efforts and events like World Wildlife Day, hopefully we can turn these trends around.

> Greetings from tropical Costa Rica! The conical Arenal Volcano rises to an impressive height of 5,437 feet, standing tall above the surrounding rainforest and Lake Arenal, the largest lake in the country. The sleepy mountain roared to life in a massive 1968 eruption that buried about 6 square miles under rocks, lava, and ash and devastated three villages. The last significant volcanic activity there took place in 2010, and the once lava-lit peak is currently dormant. With over 500 species of birds, Arenal Volcano National Park is a must-visit location for birdwatchers. The park is also home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including red brocket deer, pumas, white-faced monkeys, orchids, heliconias, and ferns. Arenal makes for an imposing and beautiful sight, towering over the tropical trees.

> In vibrant Thailand, the city of Bangkok pulses with life! Covering an area of more than 600 square miles, it is estimated that over 10 million people live there, roughly 15% of the country's population. The capital city is home to a bustling urban infrastructure, featuring a complex network of traffic circles and highways. In 1864, the completion of Charoen Krung Road marked a turn in the city's transit by serving as a pioneering construction project utilizing Western techniques. The introduction of a complex elevated expressway network in 1972 and the Don Mueang Tollway has made it easier to drive in and out of the city. Over the years, the road network has evolved to meet the demands of this sprawling urban expanse.

> Nestled in the Columbia River Gorge in Oregon, there's something special awaiting hikers: the Wahclella Falls. Fed by Tanner Creek, a tributary of the Columbia River, these waterfalls were named after a Native American village by members of the Mazama Mountaineering Club. At the end of a trail, visitors can see the spectacular two-tiered cascade that crashes down 350 feet into a pool below, which is the perfect place to take a dip and cool off. While you're swimming, keep an eye out for the water ouzel—also known as the American dipper—a species of bird that lives here. They can be spotted flying along the stream and occasionally diving into the water.

> Jutting into the sky above Els Ports Natural Park, the Roques de Benet are a cluster of rock formations in Catalonia, Spain, whose tallest peak stands about 3,330 feet above sea level. Overlooking the vast wetlands of the Ebro Delta, the peak offers views of streams and pine forests, with trails that lead into the mountains. The word 'Benet' comes from Arabic, hinting at the area's varied past, including both Arabic and Christian settlers. These days, the park is home to a variety of wildlife, from ibex and otters to vultures and eagles. Animals aren't the only inhabitants of the area. The villages nestled at the base of this massif still maintain their shared traditions, such as the age-old craft of using vegetable fibers to create baskets and kitchen utensils.

The color associated with IWD symbolizes dignity, justice, and loyalty to the cause. This event celebrates women's achievements in politics, culture, and society. Every year on March 8, educational and cultural activities, demonstrations, campaigns, and discussions highlight the importance of gender equality and women's rights.

> Time is the great transformer, changing the world and all of us. For instance, this New Mexico badland—the Bisti/De-Na-Zin Wilderness—was once a lush, tropical forest. Nearly 70 million years ago, instead of twisted terrains and towering spires, this place was home to an array of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs, including armored Ankylosaurs, duck-billed Hadrosaurs, and mighty Tyrannosaurs. Today, the area is filled with wonders of a different kind, rock formations that look more like sculptures than natural phenomena. Bisti/De-Na-Zin is named after Navajo words: Bisti means 'among the adobe formations,' and De-Na-Zin means 'standing crane,' a reference to nearby rock carvings of the bird. Visitors to the Four Corners region shouldn't miss out on this otherworldly landscape of shale and sandstone.

> Time is of the essence today: The second Sunday of March marks the start of daylight saving time. At 2 AM the clocks sprang forward one hour, meaning there will be an extra hour of daylight this evening. While Benjamin Franklin is often credited with inventing daylight saving, the first real proposal for changing the clocks came in 1895 from New Zealand entomologist George Hudson, who valued having more daylight so he could collect insects after work.
> 
> Daylight saving is now observed in about 70 countries around the world, with many places adjusting their clocks in March. The clock in today's image is in the San Jacinto Building in Beaumont, Texas, which was built in the 1920s. Each clock dial is 17 feet in diameter, so it must be quite a job to put the time forward for daylight saving!

This holiday, introduced in 1999 by Boston University professor William Anthony and his wife, Camille, promotes naps and their short-term benefits to mental alertness. Take a cue from today's image; this sleepy koala may inspire you to catch some Z's. These adorable Australian marsupials can sleep up to 20 hours a day, which helps them conserve the little energy they get from their eucalyptus-based diet. Koalas move slowly when awake, spend most of their time tucked into nooks in trees, and have a lower body temperature than other animals of their size. Let's find some time today to sneak off to a peaceful spot to experience the benefits of Napping Day.

> They say the only constant in life is change. In mathematics, however, there are many constants and today, we're celebrating perhaps the most famous of them all: pi. Represented by the symbol π, this tasty-sounding number is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, approximately 3.14159. Every March 14, mathematics fans across the world get baking to mark Pi Day with a pie. It began in 1988, when physicist Larry Shaw connected the date (3/14) with the first three digits of π. Today, mathematicians and enthusiasts celebrate Pi Day with pie eating and pi reciting. Did you know that when your clock strikes 1:59 today, you will be three decimal places closer to the real value of pi? Pi is everywhere, even in nature. Pictured here is a bodhi tree which has grown over an arch into the shape of the pi symbol at Wat Phra Ngam, a temple in Ayutthaya, Thailand.

These bamboo-munching creatures, with their distinctive black and white coats and playful demeanor, have captivated hearts for years. So much so that in 1961, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) adopted the animal as its iconic logo. National Panda Day, observed on March 16, helps to raise awareness about panda conservation and their fight for survival amid the destruction of their natural habitat. To curb the threat, the Chinese government built more than 50 reserves and by 2016, pandas were reclassified from an endangered to a vulnerable species. However, with fewer than 2,000 giant pandas remaining in the wild, the fight to protect them is far from over.

> Today, we're looking out to sea from the green pastures of St Finian's Bay in County Kerry, Ireland, to celebrate St Patrick's Day. The country's patron saint introduced Christianity to Ireland around the year 432, and his passing on March 17, 461, became a day of commemoration in his homeland.
> 
> The holiday holds cultural significance in the United States, where there are over 30 million people who claim Irish ancestry, specifically in cities like Boston, New York, and Chicago. The first festivity in America took place in Boston in 1737, organized by homesick Irish soldiers to honor their heritage. The modern celebration typically includes parades, traditional Irish music, and dance performances, wearing green clothes, and indulging in Irish cuisine and beverages. Have you pinned a shamrock to your jacket yet?

> Over millions of years, the dazzling sandstone formation known as Elephant Rock was carved by nature. Thanks to the wind and water erosion, this 170-foot-high rock near the city of Al-Ula in Saudi Arabia took on the shape of an elephant and has become a prominent landmark in the region. As the sun sets, it casts a warm glow upon the red-hued mammoth and the golden sand of the surrounding desert.

> About 7 miles from the Elephant Rock, the city of Al-Ula traces its roots back to ancient civilizations and has witnessed the passage of traders, pilgrims, and caravans crossing its arid landscapes. The surrounding area, including rock formations and Hegra's Nabataean tombs, boasts petroglyphs and inscriptions, some dating as far back as 644 CE.

> Goodbye winter! Today marks the spring or vernal equinox, the official beginning of springtime in the Northern Hemisphere. Starting today, regions north of the equator will have longer days than nights.
> 
> In some parts of the world, the arrival of spring is announced by the guttural chorus of tree frogs. They tend to be small and slender since their weight has to be supported by branches and twigs in their habitats. They can be recognized by the sticky discs on the tips of their fingers and toes, which help them cling to surfaces. The American green tree frog is the official state amphibian of both Louisiana and Georgia.

The festival commemorates the 3,000 cherry trees given to the city by the mayor of Tokyo in 1912. Twelve varieties were originally gifted but these days most of the trees are either Yoshino or Kwanzan cherries. Those circling the Tidal Basin, the location of the Jefferson Memorial featured in today's image, are Yoshino trees. The event has evolved to become a four-week celebration that attracts over 1.5 million people every year. The highlights of the festival include a lively parade filled with large, colorful helium balloons, stunning floats, and marching bands from all over the country.

Established by the UN 11 years ago, the day draws attention to the need to preserve these essential ecosystems, which supply food, water, medicines, and other resources. Covering over 30% of land on Earth, it is thought that woodlands around the world contain more than 60,000 tree species. Featured here is the Bwindi Impenetrable National Forest in Uganda, which is home to 160 species of trees and 100 species of ferns, as well as an extraordinary 50% of the world's mountain gorilla population. The forest has thickets of bamboo growing between the trees, making access on foot difficult, giving the Impenetrable Forest its name.

> It's World Water Day, a United Nations event that ripples across the globe, reminding us of the importance of this essential resource. Water quenches thirst and irrigates harvests, and its absence can derail prosperity and stability. The World Economic Forum lists the water crisis among the top global risks, with 2.2 billion people still lacking access to clean water. From educational forums to local cleanups, each action, big or small, contributes to the wave of change needed to address the crisis. This year's theme, 'Water for Peace,' invites us to reflect on water's power to foster unity. So, are you ready to dive into a current that flows deeper than New Zealand's Blue Spring at Te Waihou Walkway, pictured on our homepage? This clear spring is renowned for its purity, supplying about 70% of the country's bottled water. For those in regions without easy access to safe water, World Water Day is here to promote greater cooperation to help conserve this crucial resource, for everyone.

There's a whisper of truth to this old proverb for the storm clouds, also known as cumulonimbus or anvil clouds, which are pictured here. Today, on World Meteorological Day, we honor the marvel that is our atmosphere. This observance, first held in 1961, commemorates the establishment of the World Meteorological Organization and recognizes the vital role meteorology plays in our lives. Weather forecasts may not always appear reliable, but thanks to advances in technology like satellites and supercomputers, they have come a long way. Global weather models provide forecasts for up to 16 days and, the average lead time for tornado warnings is now around 15 minutes. Cheers for the progress made and much more to come!

Also called Rai Cave, this cavern is part of the Vinh Hy Bay—enclosed by Nui Chua National Park—in the South Central Coast region of Vietnam. The area's natural coral reefs are surrounded by rock formations that are stacked upon each other to form a group of caves. One origin of the name 'Hang Rai' or 'Rai Cave' comes from otters (rai) that were occasionally seen seeking shelter in the caves. Another explanation is attributed to the abundance of rai trees in the area, whose oil was used to waterproof boats. The landscape is an awe-inspiring sight both under and above water: corals for deep divers and colorful sunsets for those who like camping in the sea breeze.

Around the globe, from Japan to the United States, this spectacle captivates millions of hearts. In China, cherry blossoms, known as 'Yinghua,' bloom from late March to late April, adorning landscapes with delicate hues of pink and white. Revered for centuries by the Chinese, these fragile petals hold profound significance in their traditions, symbolizing renewal, hope, and the transient nature of life. Among popular places to see them are Wuhan's East Lake Cherry Blossom Park, Lu Xun Park in Shanghai, and Beijing's Yuyuantan Park. Cherry blossoms look similar to plum blossoms, but an easy way to distinguish between the two is to look at their petals. Cherry blossom petals have split ends, but plum blossoms don't.

The 91-foot-tall white tower has guided sailors since its completion in 1809; it provides safe passage for ships on the Dublin-Holyhead-Liverpool route. When it was built, sperm whale oil was used to light the lamps; however, over the years, the mechanism has been upgraded to more advanced technology like LED bulbs and Fresnel lenses. Automated in 1984, the lighthouse continues to serve as a vital navigational aid, with its powerful beam shining up to 28 miles. As the sun sets and the sky fills with colors, the silhouette of the South Stack Lighthouse in the dusk makes for a stunning sight.

> Costa Rica's forests are habitats for two sloth species: Hoffmann's two-toed sloth and the star of today's homepage, the brown-throated three-toed sloth. Despite being larger than many other tree-dwelling mammals, three-toed sloths have adapted by reducing their muscle mass and size to thrive on treetops. Their large stomachs have four chambers, which, when full, account for about 30% of their body weight. These shaggy critters are so sedentary that algae grow on their coats, which helps to camouflage them within the rainforest canopy. In 2021, these slow-moving creatures were declared national symbols in Costa Rica. Then-president Carlos Alvarado signed the initiative into law to emphasize the sloths' importance in the country's ecosystem.
