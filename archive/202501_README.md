> 元旦快乐！人类至少从公元前2000年开始庆祝新年，但不同的文化选择了与不同日期，通常与春分或是月相周期相关。公元前153年，罗马人将1月1日定为新年的开始，但在中世纪的欧洲，这一习俗逐渐被冷落。然而，自1582年起随着广泛采用格里高里历（公历），今天成为世界上大部分地区庆祝新年的日子。除了观看烟花、喝香槟和许下新年愿望外，其他全球性的传统还包括了品尝象征幸运的美食和互相赠送礼物。

> 如果你想知道今日图片中的北极熊与新年有什么关系，答案很简单，那就是“北极熊跳水”活动。世界各国都会举办冬季跳水活动，参与者跳入冰冷甚至结冰的水中，以独特的方式迎接新年。美国、加拿大、荷兰和英国等地通常都会在元旦这天举行。无论你是作为爱好者参加为慈善筹款，抑或是体验新年的传统习俗，如果打算冒险尝试“北极熊跳水”活动，请记得提前准备好一条温暖的毛巾。

> Happy New Year's Day! Humans have celebrated the new year since at least 2000 BCE, but various cultures have chosen different days coinciding with equinoxes or lunar cycles. The Romans established January 1 as the beginning of the year in 153 BCE, but this fell out of favor throughout Europe during the medieval era. Since 1582 and the widespread adoption of the Gregorian calendar, however, much of the world now celebrates the new year today. In addition to watching fireworks, drinking champagne, and making resolutions in the wee hours of the morning, other global traditions include making noise, eating lucky foods, and giving gifts.

> If you're wondering what polar bears like the ones in today's image have to do with the new year, the answer is simple: polar bear plunges. Countries around the world hold winter events where participants enter frigid, often icy bodies of water, and communities in the US, Canada, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom do this on New Year's Day. Whether doing so as an enthusiast, to raise money for charity, or as part of a new year's tradition, keep a warm towel handy if you plan to take the plunge.

> Perched on a terrace above the Inn Valley at 4,790 feet, Ardez is a hidden gem in eastern Switzerland renowned for its deep cultural roots and stunning preservation of history. This picturesque village, starring in today's image, showcases the rich traditions and unique language of Switzerland's Romansh-speaking communities. Its homes are adorned with sgraffiti—decorative designs etched into plaster—and colorful murals, both iconic art styles of the Engadin region. Dating back to 840 when it was first referred to as Ardezis, the village's history includes Steinsberg Castle, originally owned by the Bishop of Chur. Though destroyed during the Swabian War in 1499, the castle's tower has been restored multiple times and stands today as a proud reminder of its past. In 1975, Ardez was chosen as a Swiss model village for its exceptional preservation efforts, which have kept its historic charm intact.

> The nearby Chastè site is a treasure trove of history, recognized as a Swiss heritage site of national significance. This fascinating location encompasses layers of human settlement, from the late Bronze Age through the early Iron Age and even includes artifacts from the Roman Empire. Against this backdrop, the star trails in today's photo illuminate the timeless allure of Ardez, where history and natural beauty converge.
