> 元旦快乐！人类至少从公元前2000年开始庆祝新年，但不同的文化选择了与不同日期，通常与春分或是月相周期相关。公元前153年，罗马人将1月1日定为新年的开始，但在中世纪的欧洲，这一习俗逐渐被冷落。然而，自1582年起随着广泛采用格里高里历（公历），今天成为世界上大部分地区庆祝新年的日子。除了观看烟花、喝香槟和许下新年愿望外，其他全球性的传统还包括了品尝象征幸运的美食和互相赠送礼物。
> 
> 如果你想知道今日图片中的北极熊与新年有什么关系，答案很简单，那就是“北极熊跳水”活动。世界各国都会举办冬季跳水活动，参与者跳入冰冷甚至结冰的水中，以独特的方式迎接新年。美国、加拿大、荷兰和英国等地通常都会在元旦这天举行。无论你是作为爱好者参加为慈善筹款，抑或是体验新年的传统习俗，如果打算冒险尝试“北极熊跳水”活动，请记得提前准备好一条温暖的毛巾。

> Happy New Year's Day! Humans have celebrated the new year since at least 2000 BCE, but various cultures have chosen different days coinciding with equinoxes or lunar cycles. The Romans established January 1 as the beginning of the year in 153 BCE, but this fell out of favor throughout Europe during the medieval era. Since 1582 and the widespread adoption of the Gregorian calendar, however, much of the world now celebrates the new year today. In addition to watching fireworks, drinking champagne, and making resolutions in the wee hours of the morning, other global traditions include making noise, eating lucky foods, and giving gifts.
> 
> If you're wondering what polar bears like the ones in today's image have to do with the new year, the answer is simple: polar bear plunges. Countries around the world hold winter events where participants enter frigid, often icy bodies of water, and communities in the US, Canada, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom do this on New Year's Day. Whether doing so as an enthusiast, to raise money for charity, or as part of a new year's tradition, keep a warm towel handy if you plan to take the plunge.

> Perched on a terrace above the Inn Valley at 4,790 feet, Ardez is a hidden gem in eastern Switzerland renowned for its deep cultural roots and stunning preservation of history. This picturesque village, starring in today's image, showcases the rich traditions and unique language of Switzerland's Romansh-speaking communities. Its homes are adorned with sgraffiti—decorative designs etched into plaster—and colorful murals, both iconic art styles of the Engadin region. Dating back to 840 when it was first referred to as Ardezis, the village's history includes Steinsberg Castle, originally owned by the Bishop of Chur. Though destroyed during the Swabian War in 1499, the castle's tower has been restored multiple times and stands today as a proud reminder of its past. In 1975, Ardez was chosen as a Swiss model village for its exceptional preservation efforts, which have kept its historic charm intact.
> 
> The nearby Chastè site is a treasure trove of history, recognized as a Swiss heritage site of national significance. This fascinating location encompasses layers of human settlement, from the late Bronze Age through the early Iron Age and even includes artifacts from the Roman Empire. Against this backdrop, the star trails in today's photo illuminate the timeless allure of Ardez, where history and natural beauty converge.

> 'Don't adventures ever have an end? I suppose not. Someone else always has to carry on the story.' Today, on Tolkien Day, fans around the world honor the master storyteller who crafted the epic adventures of Middle-earth: J.R.R. Tolkien. While Tolkien may have started the tale, it's his readers who carry it forward, generation after generation, diving into the pages of 'The Hobbit,' 'The Lord of the Rings,' and beyond. Tolkienists are encouraged to celebrate the author's birthday with a toast at 9 PM local time—to participate, all you must do is stand and raise a glass of your choice, say 'The Professor,' and take a sip.
> 
> For today's featured image, it is only fitting to visit a place that might have inspired the literary legend: the Radcliffe Camera, or Rad Cam, at the University of Oxford in England. Originally a science library, the domed, circular building now serves as a reading room for the Bodleian Library. This 18th-century building is said to be an inspiration for Sauron's temple to Morgoth on Númenor in Tolkien's fiction. Though Tolkien himself didn't study there—he was a student at Exeter College—he would have passed by the Rad Cam countless times during his years as a professor of English Language and Literature at Oxford. This building, with its extraordinary exterior, continues to captivate visitors and Tolkien enthusiasts alike.

> Welcome to a spot where rivers meet borders in the most stunning way: Bản Giốc–Detian Falls, featured in today's image. Tucked between the karst hills of Daxin County in China and Trùng Khánh district in Vietnam, these falls tumble along the Quây Sơn River. Over 95 feet tall and 980 feet wide, it holds the distinction of being the widest waterfall in Vietnam. Located just 169 miles north of Hanoi, this waterfall have gradually worn away their crest over the years, inching upstream. For most of the year, they flow as two distinct cascades, but come summer, when the rains swell the river, they merge into one big fall.
> 
> Even with better roads, easier public transport, and drone videos showing off the jaw-dropping beauty of the falls, Bản Giốc remains refreshingly off the beaten path. Mass tourism hasn't caught up yet, and on most weekdays, you'll find only a handful of visitors—just you, the locals, and the sound of cascading water.

> Look up at the skies and experience the magic of birds—it's National Bird Day. Birds come in many shapes and colors, but few are as striking as the plum-headed parakeet, seen in today's image. Native to the Indian subcontinent, these birds are known for their swift, acrobatic flight and distinctive calls that echo through the air. There have been reports of plum-headed parakeets making their way to places like New York, Florida, and even parts of the Middle East.
> 
> Today's event was set up to help draw attention to the problems that the bird trade causes. When kept in captivity, birds are deprived of their ability to fly and socialize, which can be distressing to these animals. This activity also has an impact on wild bird populations, with thousands of parrots captured from the wild and sold as pets every year. National Bird Day also encourages the adoption of rescued birds and promotes habitat conservation efforts for wild birds, urging people not to buy wild-caught parrots. On this day, half a million bird lovers engage in activities like birdwatching, studying bird species, and, importantly, adopting birds.

> In the Italian province of Ravenna lies the Basilica of San Francesco, recognized for its beauty and historical significance. This Romanesque church, originally built in 450, features a sturdy square bell tower added in the 9th century, enhancing the basilica's exterior. Its design features three naves, divided by two rows of 12 columns each. Featured in today's image is the basilica's real showstopper: The basement crypt, or burial chamber, is a stunning model of early religious design. Complete with vaulted ceilings that slope down into rows of stone columns, its floor is a work of art itself. It's inlaid with beautifully intricate mosaic tiles that have withstood the test of time.
> 
> Built on soft marshland, Ravenna faces ongoing structural challenges because the entire city is gradually sinking. This is particularly evident in the crypt, which now remains perpetually submerged under about a foot of water. But instead of battling the slow flood, the basilica has embraced it, filling the pool with goldfish that glide between the ancient columns and above the submerged mosaics. Visitors often toss coins into the water, making the crypt more of a wishing well than a burial site.

> Are you ready to rock the new year? Today is Old Rock Day, a day for celebrating and learning about old rocks and fossils. Rocks are common and few of us take the time to consider how amazing they are. But forged in volcanoes or molded by millennia of pressure, these solid masses of minerals hold the key to understanding how our planet formed. Rocks can also contain fossils, the remnants of long-extinct organisms, which give scientists clues about what creatures and plants have lived on Earth during its 4.5-billion-year history.
> 
> One of the world's most curious rock displays can be found on Koekohe Beach in New Zealand. The Moeraki Boulders, some of which are 7 feet in diameter, have been shaped by nature over millions of years. Each boulder started as a pebble on the seabed around 65 million years ago. Over time, layers of mud and silt built up around them, cemented together by calcite. Thanks to erosion and the movement of the sea, the boulders eventually emerged. Today, new boulders are still appearing, while the elements are slowly breaking down existing ones.

> New year, new goals—so why not start by taking a step toward better health? On this National Take the Stairs Day, let's climb into the past. The Great Wall of China, one of the longest humanmade structures in the world, offers the perfect inspiration. Stretching more than 13,000 miles and dating back thousands of years, the ancient marvel in today's picture is a series of fortifications spanning rugged mountains, valleys, and deserts. Featuring steep trenches and watchtowers, parts of it were designed to keep invaders at bay. Hiking the Great Wall offers a unique glimpse into this historical landmark. The experience varies from well-preserved sections like Mutianyu to wild, unrestored parts such as Jiankou. Some steps are so high, they're more like steps on a ladder! Talk about a workout—taking these stairs could rival any modern fitness challenge.
> 
> The Great Wall of China isn't just a wall, but a symbol of perseverance and strength. Similarly, taking the stairs instead of the elevator is a small but empowering step toward better health. Millions of people live with chronic conditions like asthma, and by choosing the stairs, you're not just building strength, but also improving your overall health. So, the next time you face an elevator, think of the Great Wall and take the stairs. Your future self will thank you!

> Ever heard of frozen bubbles? Abraham Lake in Alberta, Canada, has them during the winter, and they're not just beautiful—they're science in action. Created in 1972, Abraham Lake is a human-made reservoir that spans more than 20 square miles along the North Saskatchewan River. Thanks to glacier-fed waters from the Rocky Mountains, the lake stays transparent even in the coldest months. Glacial meltwater carries fine sediment that scatters sunlight, while natural filtration through rocks keeps pollutants to a minimum.
> 
> The snowy season attracts photographers and visitors from around the world who are eager to capture a rare sight at Preacher's Point: bubbles. These frozen globes form when microorganisms break down dead plants and animals on the lake bed, releasing methane. As the gas rises, it gets trapped by the ice, creating layers of bubbles in various sizes and shapes. It's wild to think that they're flammable and chilling under your feet. The ice is thickest in January and February and the bubbles clearly visible. If you're planning to check it out, just remember to stick close to the shoreline for your safety.

> An imperial city in northern central Morocco, Meknes is steeped in history. Once the capital of Morocco under Sultan Ismail Ibn Sharif of the Alawi dynasty in the 17th century, it's known for its massive walls, grand gates, and structures built to last centuries. Meknes reflects the Moroccan style of architecture, with one of its most impressive landmarks being Heri es-Swani, seen in today's image.
> 
> Heri es-Swani was originally constructed as a stable and for storing vast amounts of grain to sustain the settlement and the sultan's armies. Its design was both practical and impressive—thick walls and an innovative cooling system helped maintain the food supply. Twenty-two rows of symmetrical arches divided the space into corridors that once had vaulted ceilings. Back then, mules climbed onto the roof terrace to deliver grain, which was dropped through specially designed holes to the floor below. The structure housed more than 12,000 horses. Today, it stands as an empty shell, acting as a scenic backdrop ready to be explored. This historical monument is a must-see for anyone curious about how empires were built and fed.

> Say hello to the crescent-tail bigeye, a fish as eye-catching as its name suggests. With large, wide eyes and a distinctive tail shaped like a crescent moon, it's hard to miss. Measuring about 20 inches long, it has a sleek body and a protruding lower jaw with small conical teeth. Its eyes are adapted to the low-light conditions of deep waters, helping it spot prey and avoid predators. This fish mainly feeds on smaller fish, crustaceans, and invertebrates, fueling its active lifestyle as it patrols the reefs and hunts for food.

> You can find these fish near Lizard Island, part of the Great Barrier Reef, and throughout the Indo-Pacific region. Named by English navigator Matthew Flinders when he mapped the Australian coastline, the the Great Barrier stretches more than 1,400 miles. This UNESCO World Heritage Site hosts more than 1,500 species of fish, 400 types of coral, and various other marine creatures such as sea turtles and dugongs. If you ever go snorkeling here, keep an eye out for the crescent-tail bigeye.

> Who says New Year's Day has to be on January 1? In Wales, the clocks turn back—figuratively—to celebrate Hen Galan, or the 'Old New Year,' on January 13. As part of this tradition, Calennig, meaning 'New Year's gift' in Welsh, plays a central role, linking the celebration to customs from the Julian calendar era. Even after most of the world switched to the Gregorian calendar in 1582, some Welsh communities clung to their old ways. Traditionally, the day involves children going door-to-door, singing songs, and offering good wishes in exchange for gifts like coins, food, or sweets. A unique feature is its clove-decorated apples. These aren't for snacking, though; they're miniature symbols of luck and prosperity.
> 
> While these old traditions have evolved in some parts of Wales, the spirit of Calennig thrives. Cities like Cardiff, the capital of Wales, have transformed the celebration into large-scale events, complete with fireworks, markets, and community gatherings. If your New Year's resolutions are already wobbling by January 13, Calennig offers a do-over. So why not embrace a little Welsh magic? Raise a toast to the joys of taking things slow or visit Ynys Llanddwyn for its lighthouse and cottages, featured in today's image. After all, in Wales, it's never too late to celebrate.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Zahara de la Sierra, a stunning whitewashed village in the hills of Cádiz province in Spain, offers a blend of history and nature in the south of the Iberian Peninsula. Perched on a rocky hilltop, the village seen in today's image overlooks the Zahara-El Gastor Reservoir and the Sierra de Grazalema Natural Park, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve since 1977. Its Moorish castle ruins and 15th-century tower reflect its history as a medieval fortress. Stroll through streets lined with flower-filled balconies, visit the church of Santa María de la Mesa, or simply relax and take in the views. Zahara is also a gateway to adventure—activities like hiking, cycling, and kayaking are only a little of what the village has to offer.
> 
> The name 'Zahara de la Sierra' was once thought to have come from 'azahar,' the Arabic word for 'citrus blossom.' However, studies suggest it comes from 'sahra,' which means 'wild' or 'barren land,' reflecting the rugged hill where the village is located. As part of Andalusia's Route of the White Villages, Zahara de la Sierra promises unforgettable experiences in a beautiful corner of Spain.

<summary>Description</summary>

> January 15, 1759, marked the opening of a place that would become the pride of London, a hub of global history, and a keeper of countless stories: the British Museum. For the first time, a national museum flung its doors wide open, offering free access to knowledge and culture for all. The story begins with Sir Hans Sloane, an Anglo-Irish physician and avid collector. His collection of more than 71,000 items, ranging from books and manuscripts to botanical samples and antiquities, formed the museum's foundation. Fast-forward 266 years, and the museum now houses more than 8 million objects, the largest collection of artifacts in the world, although only about 1% of the collection is currently on display. Its treasures span continents and millennia, from the Rosetta Stone—key to deciphering ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs—to the Parthenon Sculptures, the Benin Bronzes, and samurai armor.
> 
> Moreover, the museum has embraced modernity with virtual tours, interactive exhibits, and even TikTok moments, proving that history isn't stuck in the past. Fun fact: For more than 20 years, a cat named Mike roamed the museum grounds, charming staff and visitors alike. Mike even had an obituary published in The Times when he passed away in 1929.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Jagged pinnacles and spires, monoliths, and unusual caves—welcome to Pinnacles National Park in central California. President Theodore Roosevelt designated the area as a national monument in 1908, and Pinnacles would earn its status as a national park in 2013. As we celebrate the park's anniversary today, let's take a moment to appreciate this landscape. Pinnacles owes its formations to an ancient volcanic eruption that occurred 23 million years ago. The fiery beginnings made towering spires, cliffs, and talus caves, which are created by falling boulders wedged into narrow canyons. Over millennia, tectonic forces shifted the landmass northward, leaving the park far from its volcanic birthplace. Talk about a journey!
> 
> Pinnacles offers a variety of trails, from easy walks to challenging climbs. The High Peaks Trail, featured in today's image, tests your stamina with steep climbs and narrow passages, while Bear Gulch Reservoir provides a more relaxed stroll. Pinnacles is home to a range of wildlife including bobcats, jackrabbits, and black-tailed deer, and bird species like woodpeckers and bats, making it attractive for wildlife enthusiasts. Among the park's many treasures are once-endangered California condors, which were reintroduced here in a successful conservation effort.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Today's image features the brown pelican, a bird that doesn't just fly but soars, spots, and dives with unmatched precision. Although it's the smallest of the eight pelican species worldwide, it's still a large bird, measuring about 4 feet in length and having a wingspan of 6.5 feet. It's a marine-dwelling species and can be spotted along the Atlantic coast of the Americas, from New Jersey to the mouth of the Amazon River. On the Pacific coast, it can be spotted from British Columbia all the way to Peru, including a stop at the Galápagos Islands.
> 
> The brown pelican is a piscivore, meaning its diet mainly consists of fish. Dixon Lanier Merritt's limerick famously begins, 'A wonderful bird is the pelican; his bill can hold more than his belly can,' and it's spot on—its pouch can store up to three times the volume of its stomach. This versatile feature acts as a scoop, a tool for cooling off during hot weather, and a feeding trough for young pelicans. The brown pelican faced near extinction twice, first due to hunting and later from the impact of pesticides like DDT. Today, it's an Endangered Species Act and Environmental Protection Agency success story.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Down 654 steps, perched perilously over the sea in Sardinia, Italy, you'll find a surprise waiting for you. Neptune's Grotto is a stunning stalactite cave that sits just over 3 feet above sea level. First discovered by local fishermen in the 18th century, the grotto was named after the Roman god of the sea. The entire cave complex stretches on for around 2.5 miles, although visitors can only access about 1,000 feet of the total. Inside, there's a labyrinth of lit pathways winding past stalactite and stalagmite formations, leading to a 390-foot-long saltwater lake.
> 
> Neptune's Grotto is near the town of Alghero on the northwest coast of Sardinia, the second-largest island in the Mediterranean. It has been inhabited for at least 10,000 years, but its most important ancient civilization, the Nuragic peoples, lived there from around 1800 BCE until the 2nd century CE. At this time, villages were built around nuraghes, a kind of round tower fortress. Today, there are still around 7,000 of these nuraghes across the island, and they have become a symbol of Sardinia. Beyond its history, Sardinia is known for its beaches, mountains, and cuisine.

> Today we honor the life and legacy of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Prominent in the 1950s and 1960s, King was a Baptist minister who promoted nonviolent protest to effectuate social change. In 1963, he helped organize the March on Washington, DC, which 250,000 people attended to protest discrimination and support pending civil rights legislation. During this event, King delivered his famous "I Have a Dream" speech, imagining America free of racism and segregation. His speech is regarded as one of America's greatest, and his leadership was instrumental in ending racial segregation of African Americans throughout many parts of the United States. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, but his life was cut short by an assassin in 1968.

> What's that long, bushy tail scurrying across the branches? Chances are, it's a squirrel. These little rodents are found across most of the globe, and today is their special day: Squirrel Appreciation Day. This unofficial holiday was started by a North Carolina wildlife rehabilitator to encourage people to leave out seeds and nuts for these critters. From the tiny least pygmy squirrel—just 5.5 inches long—to the Bhutan giant flying squirrel at more than 4 feet, these mammals come in all shapes and sizes.
> 
> Today's image features a Eurasian red squirrel, photographed in the Netherlands. The red squirrel can be found across Europe and Russia, from western Spain and Portugal all the way to eastern Siberia. Their diet mainly consists of nuts, fungi, seeds, and berries, but they will occasionally eat birds' eggs. In addition to being the national mammal of Denmark, they also play a part in old Norse mythology. Ratatoskr is a red squirrel who scurries up and down Yggdrasil, the sacred tree, carrying messages and spreading gossip. So, next time you spot a red squirrel, it could just be a furry little messenger!

While geologists continue to debate parts of the formation story of the canyon, recent studies suggest the river carved its path through the region about 5 to 6 million years ago. Since then, the river has been deepening and widening the canyon while sculpting its dramatic geographic features.

> Today, the Grand Canyon is much more than just a massive chasm with exceptional vistas. It's home to some stunning geographic features, like Zoroaster Temple, featured in today's image. This towering 7,123-foot summit is in Coconino County, Arizona. The peak was named after the ancient Iranian prophet Zoroaster by George Wharton James, an American photographer and journalist, and Clarence Dutton, an American geologist. Rick Tidrick and Dave Ganci made the first summit ascent of Zoroaster Temple in September 1958. This triumph marked the Grand Canyon's first technical climb, turning it into a hotspot and igniting a wave of summit-chasing climbers.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The short-eared owl, featured in today's image, is a grassland-dwelling member of the owl family. Found on all continents except Antarctica and Australia, it's one of the most widely distributed bird species. This raptor belongs to the genus Asio, whose members are characterized by feather tufts ('ears') on their head. The short-eared owl only reveals its tufts when feeling defensive.
> 
> Irregular wingbeats cause its flight to be on the floppy side, like a moth or bat. It likes to glide a few feet above the ground in open fields and grasslands, swooping down feet first to grab its prey. Owls primarily hunt at night, but this silent hunter is also active during the day and at dusk. Its daylight hunts often line up with the peak activity of small rodents called voles—its favorite meal. Known to relocate to areas with higher rodent populations, the short-eared owl even wanders nomadically in search of better food supplies during years when vole populations are low.

> The streets come alive today with a symphony of firecrackers, red lanterns, and cheerful chatter—it's Chinese New Year. Steeped in thousands of years of tradition, this holiday marks the start of the lunisolar Chinese calendar. One of the most captivating images associated with this festival is the dragon dance, pictured here. Skilled dancers manipulate a long, flexible dragon puppet, bringing it to life with sinuous, undulating movements. The dragon, a symbol of power, dignity, and good fortune, is believed to bring luck to the community, with longer dragons bringing even more prosperity.
> 
> The festivities of the Chinese New Year aren't confined to China alone; they resonate across the globe, from the streets of Singapore to the Chinatowns of New York, San Francisco, and London. Each place adds its unique twist, but the core traditions remain the same: family reunions, sumptuous feasts, and the exchange of hongbao—red envelopes filled with money. This blend of ancient customs and modern practices unites people in joy and hope for the year ahead.

> High up in the Pyrenees, there is a gap in the mountains. More than 300 feet tall and 131 feet across, La Brecha de Rolando (Roland's Breach), featured here today, is a sight to behold. But who was Roland? Count Roland was a Frankish military leader during Charlemagne's reign in the 8th century. Legend has it that, after being defeated in battle, Roland cut a gap in the mountains—either to destroy his sword or to catch one last glimpse of France.
> 
> Roland's Breach lies within the Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park in Spain, right on the border with France. Covering more than 38,000 acres, the park is home to some spectacular limestone formations. It's made up of four different valleys and one peak—Monte Perdido—which towers more than 11,000 feet above sea level. It even has its own glacier, Monte Perdido, which is the fourth largest in the Pyrenees. A wide range of animals live in this mountainous landscape, including wild boars, Pyrenean chamois, and brown bears.

> Celebrate the beauty of zebras on International Zebra Day! These striking animals, known for their unique black and white patterns, are mostly found in the African savanna, stretching from Kenya to South Africa. Of the three zebra species, Grévy's zebra, plains zebra, and mountain zebra, the Grévy's zebra is the most endangered, with more than half its population lost in only three decades. While plains zebras are thriving, mountain zebras face significant threats, such as poaching and habitat encroachment. Zebras play an essential role in the ecosystems they live in, coexisting with predators like lions and hyenas while shaping the grasslands they call home.
> 
> In today's picture, we see two plains zebras—which are anything but plain—at sunrise in Mokala National Park, South Africa. International Zebra Day raises awareness about the challenges these animals face and encourages conservation efforts to ensure their survival. Whether by learning more or supporting wildlife initiatives, we can all play a role in protecting these fascinating creatures.
