> 元旦快乐！人类至少从公元前2000年开始庆祝新年，但不同的文化选择了与不同日期，通常与春分或是月相周期相关。公元前153年，罗马人将1月1日定为新年的开始，但在中世纪的欧洲，这一习俗逐渐被冷落。然而，自1582年起随着广泛采用格里高里历（公历），今天成为世界上大部分地区庆祝新年的日子。除了观看烟花、喝香槟和许下新年愿望外，其他全球性的传统还包括了品尝象征幸运的美食和互相赠送礼物。
> 
> 如果你想知道今日图片中的北极熊与新年有什么关系，答案很简单，那就是“北极熊跳水”活动。世界各国都会举办冬季跳水活动，参与者跳入冰冷甚至结冰的水中，以独特的方式迎接新年。美国、加拿大、荷兰和英国等地通常都会在元旦这天举行。无论你是作为爱好者参加为慈善筹款，抑或是体验新年的传统习俗，如果打算冒险尝试“北极熊跳水”活动，请记得提前准备好一条温暖的毛巾。

> Happy New Year's Day! Humans have celebrated the new year since at least 2000 BCE, but various cultures have chosen different days coinciding with equinoxes or lunar cycles. The Romans established January 1 as the beginning of the year in 153 BCE, but this fell out of favor throughout Europe during the medieval era. Since 1582 and the widespread adoption of the Gregorian calendar, however, much of the world now celebrates the new year today. In addition to watching fireworks, drinking champagne, and making resolutions in the wee hours of the morning, other global traditions include making noise, eating lucky foods, and giving gifts.
> 
> If you're wondering what polar bears like the ones in today's image have to do with the new year, the answer is simple: polar bear plunges. Countries around the world hold winter events where participants enter frigid, often icy bodies of water, and communities in the US, Canada, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom do this on New Year's Day. Whether doing so as an enthusiast, to raise money for charity, or as part of a new year's tradition, keep a warm towel handy if you plan to take the plunge.

> Perched on a terrace above the Inn Valley at 4,790 feet, Ardez is a hidden gem in eastern Switzerland renowned for its deep cultural roots and stunning preservation of history. This picturesque village, starring in today's image, showcases the rich traditions and unique language of Switzerland's Romansh-speaking communities. Its homes are adorned with sgraffiti—decorative designs etched into plaster—and colorful murals, both iconic art styles of the Engadin region. Dating back to 840 when it was first referred to as Ardezis, the village's history includes Steinsberg Castle, originally owned by the Bishop of Chur. Though destroyed during the Swabian War in 1499, the castle's tower has been restored multiple times and stands today as a proud reminder of its past. In 1975, Ardez was chosen as a Swiss model village for its exceptional preservation efforts, which have kept its historic charm intact.
> 
> The nearby Chastè site is a treasure trove of history, recognized as a Swiss heritage site of national significance. This fascinating location encompasses layers of human settlement, from the late Bronze Age through the early Iron Age and even includes artifacts from the Roman Empire. Against this backdrop, the star trails in today's photo illuminate the timeless allure of Ardez, where history and natural beauty converge.

> 'Don't adventures ever have an end? I suppose not. Someone else always has to carry on the story.' Today, on Tolkien Day, fans around the world honor the master storyteller who crafted the epic adventures of Middle-earth: J.R.R. Tolkien. While Tolkien may have started the tale, it's his readers who carry it forward, generation after generation, diving into the pages of 'The Hobbit,' 'The Lord of the Rings,' and beyond. Tolkienists are encouraged to celebrate the author's birthday with a toast at 9 PM local time—to participate, all you must do is stand and raise a glass of your choice, say 'The Professor,' and take a sip.
> 
> For today's featured image, it is only fitting to visit a place that might have inspired the literary legend: the Radcliffe Camera, or Rad Cam, at the University of Oxford in England. Originally a science library, the domed, circular building now serves as a reading room for the Bodleian Library. This 18th-century building is said to be an inspiration for Sauron's temple to Morgoth on Númenor in Tolkien's fiction. Though Tolkien himself didn't study there—he was a student at Exeter College—he would have passed by the Rad Cam countless times during his years as a professor of English Language and Literature at Oxford. This building, with its extraordinary exterior, continues to captivate visitors and Tolkien enthusiasts alike.

> Welcome to a spot where rivers meet borders in the most stunning way: Bản Giốc–Detian Falls, featured in today's image. Tucked between the karst hills of Daxin County in China and Trùng Khánh district in Vietnam, these falls tumble along the Quây Sơn River. Over 95 feet tall and 980 feet wide, it holds the distinction of being the widest waterfall in Vietnam. Located just 169 miles north of Hanoi, this waterfall have gradually worn away their crest over the years, inching upstream. For most of the year, they flow as two distinct cascades, but come summer, when the rains swell the river, they merge into one big fall.
> 
> Even with better roads, easier public transport, and drone videos showing off the jaw-dropping beauty of the falls, Bản Giốc remains refreshingly off the beaten path. Mass tourism hasn't caught up yet, and on most weekdays, you'll find only a handful of visitors—just you, the locals, and the sound of cascading water.

> Look up at the skies and experience the magic of birds—it's National Bird Day. Birds come in many shapes and colors, but few are as striking as the plum-headed parakeet, seen in today's image. Native to the Indian subcontinent, these birds are known for their swift, acrobatic flight and distinctive calls that echo through the air. There have been reports of plum-headed parakeets making their way to places like New York, Florida, and even parts of the Middle East.
> 
> Today's event was set up to help draw attention to the problems that the bird trade causes. When kept in captivity, birds are deprived of their ability to fly and socialize, which can be distressing to these animals. This activity also has an impact on wild bird populations, with thousands of parrots captured from the wild and sold as pets every year. National Bird Day also encourages the adoption of rescued birds and promotes habitat conservation efforts for wild birds, urging people not to buy wild-caught parrots. On this day, half a million bird lovers engage in activities like birdwatching, studying bird species, and, importantly, adopting birds.

> In the Italian province of Ravenna lies the Basilica of San Francesco, recognized for its beauty and historical significance. This Romanesque church, originally built in 450, features a sturdy square bell tower added in the 9th century, enhancing the basilica's exterior. Its design features three naves, divided by two rows of 12 columns each. Featured in today's image is the basilica's real showstopper: The basement crypt, or burial chamber, is a stunning model of early religious design. Complete with vaulted ceilings that slope down into rows of stone columns, its floor is a work of art itself. It's inlaid with beautifully intricate mosaic tiles that have withstood the test of time.
> 
> Built on soft marshland, Ravenna faces ongoing structural challenges because the entire city is gradually sinking. This is particularly evident in the crypt, which now remains perpetually submerged under about a foot of water. But instead of battling the slow flood, the basilica has embraced it, filling the pool with goldfish that glide between the ancient columns and above the submerged mosaics. Visitors often toss coins into the water, making the crypt more of a wishing well than a burial site.

> Are you ready to rock the new year? Today is Old Rock Day, a day for celebrating and learning about old rocks and fossils. Rocks are common and few of us take the time to consider how amazing they are. But forged in volcanoes or molded by millennia of pressure, these solid masses of minerals hold the key to understanding how our planet formed. Rocks can also contain fossils, the remnants of long-extinct organisms, which give scientists clues about what creatures and plants have lived on Earth during its 4.5-billion-year history.
> 
> One of the world's most curious rock displays can be found on Koekohe Beach in New Zealand. The Moeraki Boulders, some of which are 7 feet in diameter, have been shaped by nature over millions of years. Each boulder started as a pebble on the seabed around 65 million years ago. Over time, layers of mud and silt built up around them, cemented together by calcite. Thanks to erosion and the movement of the sea, the boulders eventually emerged. Today, new boulders are still appearing, while the elements are slowly breaking down existing ones.
