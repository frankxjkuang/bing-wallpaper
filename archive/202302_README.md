> They were just high school kids, named Ernest, Elizabeth, Jefferson, Terrence, Carlotta, Minnijean, Gloria, Thelma, and Melba, who made history in 1957 when they became the first Black pupils at their school, in the face of fierce opposition. We start Black History Month here in Little Rock, the state capital of Arkansas, at the Little Rock Nine Monument, named for that group of kids who played an important role in desegregating public schools. Their contributions to the civil rights movement are a moving reminder of how far we've come as a nation, and of how very different life was for Black Americans not so long ago.

> Groundhog Day is a North American tradition with roots in the February 2 Candlemas observance practiced by German immigrants. The most well-known Groundhog Day celebration, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, was first promoted by a local newspaper editor in 1886. Thousands of people gather in Punxsutawney each year to witness the groundhog emerge from its burrow, and more importantly, to see if the critter spots its shadow. If it does, winter will go on for six weeks, according to tradition. If it does not, spring-like conditions are said to be coming. Studies have yet to prove any link between the two events, but that hasn’t cast a shadow over this unusual tradition, which remains as popular as ever in the 21st century.

> Among all the pre-Lenten celebrations that take place around the world in February, the most famous are associated with warm-weather cities like Rio and New Orleans, where revelers party in elaborate costumes during the run-up to Ash Wednesday. It's a different affair in Quebec City, Canada, pictured here, where participants in the Quebec Winter Carnival enjoy all things winter, from snow sculptures to sleigh races. This former frontier outpost, and little sister to Montreal, is known for its spirited embrace of the coldest, darkest season. So, it's no surprise that its winter festival is the biggest in the Western Hemisphere. Our homepage image shows the grandiose Château Frontenac hotel, which opened in 1893, towering over the city's historic Old Quebec neighborhood, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

<summary>Description</summary>

> On Dec 1, 1955, Alabama native Rosa Parks took a stand when she refused to stand. Parks rejected bus driver James F. Blake's order to vacate a seat on a Mongomery bus in favor of a white passenger and was arrested and fined for this act of civil disobedience. Parks then helped lead a boycott of Montgomery buses that lasted for over a year. The year-long protest finally ended when the US Supreme Court ruled that Alabama’s laws enforcing segregation on city buses and other modes of transportation were unconstitutional.
> 
> We're remembering Parks on the anniversary of her birth on Feb 4, 1913. Her act of defiance was a pivotal moment in the civil rights struggle. Though some tried to paint the seamstress as an accidental martyr, Parks was already involved in the movement at the time of her arrest. She later said of the incident, 'People always say that I didn't give up my seat because I was tired, but that isn't true. I was not tired physically, or no more tired than I usually was at the end of a working day. I was not old, although some people have an image of me as being old then. I was forty-two. No, the only tired I was, was tired of giving in.'

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we're in Pismo Beach, California, to celebrate one of the best-known species of butterflies—the monarch. Western Monarch Day marks their seasonal migration to California's Central Coast from cold northern locations west of the Rocky Mountains.
> 
> A grove of eucalyptus trees at Pismo State Beach creates an optimal microclimate for the butterflies. Thousands arrive in the fall and roost through the winter until March, when they begin to fly north. After traveling a relatively short distance inland, the monarchs stop to mate and lay eggs on milkweed plants. The eggs will hatch after just a few days, eventually transforming into the next generation of adult butterflies to continue the trek. The annual cycle takes four or five generations of monarchs to complete, so the butterflies are following in the path most recently traveled by their great-grandparents (or so).
> 
> In recent years, Western monarch butterfly populations have suffered significant declines, due to climate change and loss of overwintering habitats. We can help protect and restore monarch butterflies by planting native milkweed (their primary food source) and other pollinator-friendly plants in our gardens and yards.

Waitangi Day is New Zealand's national day, established to commemorate the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi on February 6, 1840. The document was signed by representatives of the British Crown and some 500 Māori chiefs to establish British law on the islands. The treaty also created the framework for political relations between New Zealand's government and the Indigenous Māori people. It's considered New Zealand's founding document and a cornerstone in the country's history.

> The Great Backyard Bird Count has begun! Time to pay more attention to our feathered friends and help scientists learn about wild bird populations. The event runs over four days and will see people using apps and websites to identify local birds and share their sightings from their backyards, or other favorite spots, for as little as 15 minutes a day.
> 
> Last year, the US had the highest number of participants, followed by India and Canada, with more than 7,000 bird species identified overall from 192 countries. The event, which began in the US in 1998, is sponsored by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, the National Audubon Society, and Birds Canada.
> 
> So, whether you spot an Allen's hummingbird, like the one pictured on our homepage in southern central Mexico, a Northern cardinal, an American crow, or one of thousands of other bird species, your snapshot of local birdlife will be part of something much bigger, helping to track the movements of winter birds worldwide.

> The Eben Ice Caves only exist during the freezing winters of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. For the rest of the year, there are only sandstone cliffs and cedar trees here. But when temperatures drop, water flows over the canyon cliffs and turns into these beautiful, colorful ice formations.
> 
> Visitors can walk through the space created between the cliffs and the walls of ice that stretch up to 50 feet high. Make sure to bring your crampons or hiking boots and look out for the local wildlife! Only 3% of Michigan's human population lives in the Upper Peninsula, but the area is teeming with bears, moose, wolves and other animals.

> If you ever want to feel insignificant, just think about the sheer size of a humpback whale. With adults growing up to 56 feet long, humpback whales are one of the biggest mammals on Earth. In February, Hawaii celebrates the return of these migrating giants with its Maui Whale Festival. This month-long event encourages people to get involved in conservation efforts and includes whale-watching tours, allowing closer views of these beautiful creatures.
> 
> A species of baleen whale, humpback whales are known for their haunting, elaborate songs, which travel vast distances through the ocean. It is only the males that sing and each whale population has its own song. Although the exact purpose is still a mystery, it is thought the songs might allow them to communicate with other whales over vast distances and help navigate new areas. These great leviathans of the deep also share a common ancestor with one of the world's biggest land mammals—they are distant relatives of the hippopotamus.

> Celebrated on the third Monday of February each year, Presidents Day honors and commemorates US presidents past and present.
> 
> While the holiday originally celebrated George Washington's birthday on February 22, the date was changed so that it always fell on a Monday, allowing the average working American to enjoy more long weekends during the year (and we surely aren't complaining).
> 
> Presidents Day, much like the Fourth of July, is a great opportunity to remember the country's history and revisit its past and heritage. Also, if you can't wait for July to flaunt your patriotism, this is the perfect day to bring out your favorite red, white, and blue adornments.

> As Black History Month winds down, we're remembering the Freedom Sunday rally at Chicago's Soldier Field, which took place on July 10, 1966. More than 30,000 people listened to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. speak powerfully about racial injustices in the housing industry. The Chicago Freedom Movement had begun a year earlier when local civil rights groups invited Dr. King to lead demonstrations against segregation in education and housing as well as employment discrimination. The movement lasted from mid-1965 to early 1967 and is credited with inspiring the Fair Housing Act, passed by Congress in 1968.

> As twilight turns to night, the city of Paris lights up. Streets and buildings are bathed in light, alongside grand monuments such as the Hôtel National des Invalides, whose famous dome shines out in our homepage image. It was built during the 17th century under Louis XIV, as a hospital and home for army veterans. It was also Louis XIV, known as the Sun King, who ordered streetlights to be erected throughout the city to light up dark alleys where lawbreakers might lurk. Parisians were also asked to put up lanterns and oil lamps, and place lit candles in their windows.
> 
> Today, the City of Light is a dream destination for travelers in search of museums, renowned cuisine, and a touch of romance. This beautiful city is brimming with history as well, serving up stunning gardens, world-famous monuments, and a labyrinth of catacombs beneath the city streets for those who seek to dine out on its cultural offerings.

> 
> Closely related to the North American wood duck, the mandarin duck is native to East Asia, but populations have been introduced to a variety of European countries as well as the British Isles. This drake is hunkering down in Richmond Park, London, a national nature reserve about three times the size of New York's Central Park, so hopefully he won't have too much trouble finding a mate come spring.

> As the sun rises on Bryce Canyon, its snow-capped red rock formations start to glow. These slender towers are called hoodoos, and Bryce Canyon National Park has the highest concentration of them anywhere on Earth.
> 
> The hoodoos here have a soft base of sedimentary rock with a cap of more solid stone. The snow and frost of the Utah winter will eventually wear away the base, causing the cap to fall and leaving the remaining rock exposed to further erosion. Thankfully, these formations are still standing for now, allowing us to take in their natural majesty as the park celebrates its 100th anniversary.

> Those brave enough to step out over this suspension bridge will be treated to a macaw's-eye view of the Amazon rainforest, on which the survival of life on Earth depends. The vast Amazon biome, which spans 2.6 million square miles—an area twice the size of India—stores enormous amounts of carbon and supports approximately 10% of all known animal and plant species on Earth.
> 
> The Amazon River discharges more water than any other river on Earth, and almost 20% of all water that flows into the ocean first travels through the Amazon River basin. While almost two-thirds of the Amazon River basin lies in Brazil, it stretches across seven other countries, from the Andes Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean. This section of canopy is in Peru's Tambopata National Reserve, home to giant harpy eagles, macaws, jaguars, capybaras, sloths, and giant otters.
