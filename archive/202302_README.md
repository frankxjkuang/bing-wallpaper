> They were just high school kids, named Ernest, Elizabeth, Jefferson, Terrence, Carlotta, Minnijean, Gloria, Thelma, and Melba, who made history in 1957 when they became the first Black pupils at their school, in the face of fierce opposition. We start Black History Month here in Little Rock, the state capital of Arkansas, at the Little Rock Nine Monument, named for that group of kids who played an important role in desegregating public schools. Their contributions to the civil rights movement are a moving reminder of how far we've come as a nation, and of how very different life was for Black Americans not so long ago.

> Groundhog Day is a North American tradition with roots in the February 2 Candlemas observance practiced by German immigrants. The most well-known Groundhog Day celebration, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, was first promoted by a local newspaper editor in 1886. Thousands of people gather in Punxsutawney each year to witness the groundhog emerge from its burrow, and more importantly, to see if the critter spots its shadow. If it does, winter will go on for six weeks, according to tradition. If it does not, spring-like conditions are said to be coming. Studies have yet to prove any link between the two events, but that hasn’t cast a shadow over this unusual tradition, which remains as popular as ever in the 21st century.

> Among all the pre-Lenten celebrations that take place around the world in February, the most famous are associated with warm-weather cities like Rio and New Orleans, where revelers party in elaborate costumes during the run-up to Ash Wednesday. It's a different affair in Quebec City, Canada, pictured here, where participants in the Quebec Winter Carnival enjoy all things winter, from snow sculptures to sleigh races. This former frontier outpost, and little sister to Montreal, is known for its spirited embrace of the coldest, darkest season. So, it's no surprise that its winter festival is the biggest in the Western Hemisphere. Our homepage image shows the grandiose Château Frontenac hotel, which opened in 1893, towering over the city's historic Old Quebec neighborhood, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

<summary>Description</summary>

> On Dec 1, 1955, Alabama native Rosa Parks took a stand when she refused to stand. Parks rejected bus driver James F. Blake's order to vacate a seat on a Mongomery bus in favor of a white passenger and was arrested and fined for this act of civil disobedience. Parks then helped lead a boycott of Montgomery buses that lasted for over a year. The year-long protest finally ended when the US Supreme Court ruled that Alabama’s laws enforcing segregation on city buses and other modes of transportation were unconstitutional.
> 
> We're remembering Parks on the anniversary of her birth on Feb 4, 1913. Her act of defiance was a pivotal moment in the civil rights struggle. Though some tried to paint the seamstress as an accidental martyr, Parks was already involved in the movement at the time of her arrest. She later said of the incident, 'People always say that I didn't give up my seat because I was tired, but that isn't true. I was not tired physically, or no more tired than I usually was at the end of a working day. I was not old, although some people have an image of me as being old then. I was forty-two. No, the only tired I was, was tired of giving in.'

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we're in Pismo Beach, California, to celebrate one of the best-known species of butterflies—the monarch. Western Monarch Day marks their seasonal migration to California's Central Coast from cold northern locations west of the Rocky Mountains.
> 
> A grove of eucalyptus trees at Pismo State Beach creates an optimal microclimate for the butterflies. Thousands arrive in the fall and roost through the winter until March, when they begin to fly north. After traveling a relatively short distance inland, the monarchs stop to mate and lay eggs on milkweed plants. The eggs will hatch after just a few days, eventually transforming into the next generation of adult butterflies to continue the trek. The annual cycle takes four or five generations of monarchs to complete, so the butterflies are following in the path most recently traveled by their great-grandparents (or so).
> 
> In recent years, Western monarch butterfly populations have suffered significant declines, due to climate change and loss of overwintering habitats. We can help protect and restore monarch butterflies by planting native milkweed (their primary food source) and other pollinator-friendly plants in our gardens and yards.

> For Waitangi Day, we're visiting the spectacular landscape of Fiordland National Park on New Zealand's South Island. Waitangi Day is New Zealand's national day, established to commemorate the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi on February 6, 1840. The document was signed by representatives of the British Crown and some 500 Māori chiefs to establish British law on the islands. The treaty also created the framework for political relations between New Zealand's government and the Indigenous Māori people. It's considered New Zealand's founding document and a cornerstone in the country's history.

> 艾琳多南堡坐落在苏格兰三个湖泊的交汇处，其宁静的表面下，是数个世纪的风云动荡。维京人、封建贵族和起义军来来去去，在这个苏格兰西部高地的湖滨城堡里留下了他们的足迹。
> 
> 艾琳多南城堡始建于13世纪，用来防御维京人。后来，艾琳多南城堡经历了至少四次重建。中世纪时，这座城堡大部分时间都处于麦肯齐家族及其盟友马克雷家族的掌控下。1719年詹姆斯党人叛乱期间，艾琳多南城堡被英国皇家海军的炮弹摧毁，荒废了200年。
> 
> 艾琳多南城堡位于杜伊奇湖、朗湖和阿尔什湖的交汇处。1911年，陆军中校约翰·麦克雷-吉尔斯特拉普买下它，用了20多年的时间重建城堡，并于1932年对外开放。重建时，城堡还新增了一座石桥，跨湖连接陆地，让城堡变得更加实用、美观和现代。现在，艾琳多南堡已成为苏格兰高地最受欢迎的景点之一，它的形象经常出现在包装和广告上。

> With sweeping views of fjords, mountains, and the sea, this is possibly one of the most beautiful places in the world to rest when you are on the road. Ureddplassen, also known as Uredd Rest Area, provides a place for respite to travelers on a section of the Helgelandskysten national scenic route in Norway. It also serves as a WWII memorial, sharing its name with a Norwegian submarine which was lost when it hit a German mine in February 1943.
> 
> With its minimalist architecture and breath-taking scenery, Ureddplassen offers a visual experience like no other. It has marble benches and steps leading out to the open sea, and a wave-shaped public restroom with frosted glass that lights up beautifully in the dark.
> 
> Since its unveiling, the rest area has quickly become a popular tourist destination. Here, visitors and locals can witness the midnight sun in summer and feast their eyes on the northern lights in winter.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we're peering up from the depths of Lower Antelope Canyon, located in Lake Powell Navajo Tribal Park near Page, Arizona. This tall, narrow channel is an entry point into Antelope Canyon, a slot canyon that was created over millions of years by flash floods carving away at the soft Navajo sandstone.
> 
> The Navajo name for Lower Antelope Canyon is Hazdistazí (spiral rock arches), but hikers have nicknamed it the Corkscrew for its twists and turns. Visitors shimmy through tight passages and climb up and down ladders to reach the bottom of the chamber. There they find themselves in an almost otherworldly environment, where sunbeams break through to the canyon floor, making the stone walls glow.
> 
> Tour guides, managed by the Navajo Nation, are mandatory for visitors to the canyon.
