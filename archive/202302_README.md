> They were just high school kids, named Ernest, Elizabeth, Jefferson, Terrence, Carlotta, Minnijean, Gloria, Thelma, and Melba, who made history in 1957 when they became the first Black pupils at their school, in the face of fierce opposition. We start Black History Month here in Little Rock, the state capital of Arkansas, at the Little Rock Nine Monument, named for that group of kids who played an important role in desegregating public schools. Their contributions to the civil rights movement are a moving reminder of how far we've come as a nation, and of how very different life was for Black Americans not so long ago.

> Groundhog Day is a North American tradition with roots in the February 2 Candlemas observance practiced by German immigrants. The most well-known Groundhog Day celebration, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, was first promoted by a local newspaper editor in 1886. Thousands of people gather in Punxsutawney each year to witness the groundhog emerge from its burrow, and more importantly, to see if the critter spots its shadow. If it does, winter will go on for six weeks, according to tradition. If it does not, spring-like conditions are said to be coming. Studies have yet to prove any link between the two events, but that hasn’t cast a shadow over this unusual tradition, which remains as popular as ever in the 21st century.

> Among all the pre-Lenten celebrations that take place around the world in February, the most famous are associated with warm-weather cities like Rio and New Orleans, where revelers party in elaborate costumes during the run-up to Ash Wednesday. It's a different affair in Quebec City, Canada, pictured here, where participants in the Quebec Winter Carnival enjoy all things winter, from snow sculptures to sleigh races. This former frontier outpost, and little sister to Montreal, is known for its spirited embrace of the coldest, darkest season. So, it's no surprise that its winter festival is the biggest in the Western Hemisphere. Our homepage image shows the grandiose Château Frontenac hotel, which opened in 1893, towering over the city's historic Old Quebec neighborhood, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
