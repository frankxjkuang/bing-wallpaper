> Nestled amidst the Julian Alps, Slovenia's Lake Bled invites you to step into a storybook setting. The star of the show? The tiny Bled Island, which beckons with the promise of legends and 'rowmance.' Make your way there on a traditional, flat-bottomed pletna boat, piloted by oarsmen whose skills have been handed down through generations since 1740. The island is home to the 17th-century Assumption of Mary Church, with its special bell that, legend says, will make wishes come true. If you look to the shore directly above the island in our image, you can spot Bled Castle overlooking the lake's expanse. The castle—one of the oldest in Slovenia—is positioned on a precipice above the town of Bled on the northwestern shore of the lake.

> Did you know that the name Louis Vuitton is linked with more than just fashion? The eye-catching structure in today's image is the Louis Vuitton Foundation, an art museum and cultural center in Paris, France. The extravagant building opened in 2014, the result of a collaboration between the luxury goods company's CEO, Bernard Arnault, and renowned architect Frank Gehry. Gehry drew inspiration from iconic Parisian buildings, including the glass-roofed 19th-century Grand Palais exhibition hall, and applied concepts from 19th-century English landscape gardens.

> But architecture isn't just about stunning grand structures like this one. World Architecture Day was established in 1985 by the International Union of Architects to align with UN World Habitat Day. On the first Monday of October, both reflect on the basic rights of everyone to housing and shelter, and the responsibilities of those who shape towns and cities.

> It's World Space Week, an opportunity to celebrate humanity's extraterrestrial achievements, as well as the benefits that come from space exploration and technology. The star of our homepage is actually a star-forming region known as the Tarantula Nebula, found in the same group of galaxies as our Milky Way. This detailed image was captured by the powerful James Webb Space Telescope and shows thousands of never-before-seen stars, previously obscured by cosmic dust. The nebula's colossal size and dynamic energy offer plenty of compelling material for astronomers and stargazers of all stripes.

> It's World Teachers' Day, time to celebrate those who dedicate their lives to transmitting knowledge, skills, and experience. Just as teachers shape minds and futures, nature too offers its own ways of passing knowledge. Nestled in the rocky landscapes of the Antarctic Peninsula and Antarctic islands, gentoo penguin hatchlings, born in pairs, benefit from dedicated parental support. The father and mother raise them in a bonded, monogamous pair, bringing food back to the stony nest they have built together. After being fed and raised for 30 days, the chicks join a larger flock known as a crèche or nursery for safety and to learn social behavior. Penguin parents and their community pass on their wisdom through the language of survival.

> Taughannock Falls State Park, in New York's scenic Finger Lakes area, is home to this magnificent waterfall of the same name, which plunges 215 feet over the cliffs into the gorge below. The park also boasts stunning pathways, unique rock formations, and numerous wild animals. It's not certain where the name Taughannock came from, though a leading theory says it is a combination of Iroquois and Algonquin terms, roughly translating to 'great fall in the woods.' The park, which was founded in 1924, guarantees visitors memorable adventures, whether you hike the rim paths for panoramic views of the falls and rock formations, take a plunge in Cayuga Lake, or bring a pair of binoculars for birding. A keen eye can spot winged locals such as turkey vultures, common loons, and great horned owls.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Are you ready for winter? These brown bears of Katmai National Park sure are, and their efforts won't go unrewarded. Each year, park rangers organize a bracketed tournament to crown one ravenous contender as the fattest bear. Webcams are set up so anyone can join the crowds watching these bears chow down on sockeye salmon, as the fish return to the park to spawn. Once you've witnessed the feast, you can vote for which bear you think should win the title. New generations will bring new competitors, but they have big paw prints to fill. Bears such as Beadnose and 747—each animal has an ID number and several have names—are repeat champions but fat bear Otis reigns supreme, with four titles to his name. This year's Fat Bear Week finishes on Tuesday, October 10.

> What exactly are we looking at here? The veined octopus, also known as the coconut octopus, is one of the smartest animals on Earth, building shelters from seashells and coconut shells. If you peek inside, you may spot those telltale suction cups that cover the creature's eight limbs. These arms contain clusters of neurons, which make them particularly sensitive, and each arm can be used separately to perform complex tasks. Octopuses can also match the color—sometimes even the texture—of their environment, making them even more difficult to spot. There's lots more to learn about these fascinating animals, and World Octopus Day is a great day to do it. You could always start with the Academy Award-winning documentary 'My Octopus Teacher.'
