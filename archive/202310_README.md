> Nestled amidst the Julian Alps, Slovenia's Lake Bled invites you to step into a storybook setting. The star of the show? The tiny Bled Island, which beckons with the promise of legends and 'rowmance.' Make your way there on a traditional, flat-bottomed pletna boat, piloted by oarsmen whose skills have been handed down through generations since 1740. The island is home to the 17th-century Assumption of Mary Church, with its special bell that, legend says, will make wishes come true. If you look to the shore directly above the island in our image, you can spot Bled Castle overlooking the lake's expanse. The castle—one of the oldest in Slovenia—is positioned on a precipice above the town of Bled on the northwestern shore of the lake.

> Did you know that the name Louis Vuitton is linked with more than just fashion? The eye-catching structure in today's image is the Louis Vuitton Foundation, an art museum and cultural center in Paris, France. The extravagant building opened in 2014, the result of a collaboration between the luxury goods company's CEO, Bernard Arnault, and renowned architect Frank Gehry. Gehry drew inspiration from iconic Parisian buildings, including the glass-roofed 19th-century Grand Palais exhibition hall, and applied concepts from 19th-century English landscape gardens.

> But architecture isn't just about stunning grand structures like this one. World Architecture Day was established in 1985 by the International Union of Architects to align with UN World Habitat Day. On the first Monday of October, both reflect on the basic rights of everyone to housing and shelter, and the responsibilities of those who shape towns and cities.

> It's World Space Week, an opportunity to celebrate humanity's extraterrestrial achievements, as well as the benefits that come from space exploration and technology. The star of our homepage is actually a star-forming region known as the Tarantula Nebula, found in the same group of galaxies as our Milky Way. This detailed image was captured by the powerful James Webb Space Telescope and shows thousands of never-before-seen stars, previously obscured by cosmic dust. The nebula's colossal size and dynamic energy offer plenty of compelling material for astronomers and stargazers of all stripes.
