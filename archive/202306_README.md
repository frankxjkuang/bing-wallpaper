<summary>Description</summary>

> The Great Barrier Reef runs for 1,430 miles along Australia's northeastern coast, providing a home for thousands of species, including more than 1,500 types of fish. Here, you'll find whales, dolphins, turtles, sharks, dugongs, and algae, all living together in a delicate ecosystem that relies on the coral reef. Sadly, climate change and pollution threaten this iconic site, the largest reef in the world. On June 1, we observe World Reef Awareness Day to remind people of the importance of safeguarding coral reefs, which provide food and shelter for about 25% of all marine life, to maintain the balance of nature.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> To quote Jurassic Park's Dr. Malcolm: 'Life, uh, finds a way.' Animals and plants are found in some of Earth's most inhospitable places, from penguins and polar bears in the freezing Arctic to camels in scalding deserts. This lonely gemsbok, seen here in sand dunes in Namibia, is used to living in an inhospitable environment. Also known as the oryx, it is native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, especially around the Namib and Kalahari deserts. The gemsbok does not need to drink much water, instead finding hydration in the vegetation it grazes upon—including wild tsamma melons and cucumbers. When vegetation is sparse, they can dig deep to find roots and tubers to supplement their diet.

> Today is a great day to take a hike! Each year, National Trails Day brings together nature lovers, government agencies, and businesses to preserve hiking trails for everyone to enjoy. Looking for a stunning spot to stretch your legs? We suggest South Kaibab Trail in the Grand Canyon, seen here. The trail starts with a series of switchbacks known as 'The Chimney,' which leads to a steep, narrow descent—prepare for an invigorating workout! All that hard work will pay off though—fresh air and exertion can boost your mood, improve sleep, and reduce the risk of heart disease. Not to mention the panoramic views you can enjoy from the trail's scenic viewpoints.

> Brooding black sand beaches are popular with photographers looking for something a little different, and Hawaii has plenty of them on offer. This famous beach at Wai'ānapanapa State Park on Maui was created when basalt, a dark volcanic rock, was eroded by waves into fine grains, creating a stunning shoreline. You'll find it on Maui's east side, toward the end of the legendary Road to Hana, a scenic 64-mile highway. You can also find black sand shores around the world, from Alaska to Greece, Costa Rica, Italy, Iceland, Indonesia, and New Zealand.

> 'To damage the Earth is to damage your children,' as the writer and environmentalist Wendell Berry put it. Today is World Environment Day, which marks its 50th year of raising awareness and encouraging action to protect the natural world. This year's theme is about finding solutions to plastic pollution, which brings us to our homepage image.
> 
> The colorful collection of assembled objects in this picture is just a small section of an art installation named 'Priscilla the Parrotfish.' Like other sculptures by the Washed Ashore environmental project, Priscilla was constructed from plastic litter found on Oregon's beaches. While striking to look at, the sculpture reminds us that more than 8 million tons of plastic are estimated to be dumped in the ocean each year, harming marine life. This year's World Environment Day urges an end to the flow of waste, by changing the way we produce, use, and dispose of plastic.

<summary>Description</summary>

> On June 6, 1944, after months of planning, Allied forces descended on the beaches of Normandy, France, for the start of one of the most ambitious military attacks in history. Codenamed Operation Overlord, the Battle of Normandy was an operation to free Western Europe from Nazi occupation during World War II. This military action would play a pivotal role in the Allies' win against the Axis powers.
> 
> Today's Normandy is a far cry from the battlefields of war. This beautiful region draws travelers from around the world, who feast their eyes on landscapes that inspired the great Impressionist painters, while sampling the famous local cheese, Camembert. However, blunt physical reminders of the past remain scattered about the region, a lasting reminder of the thousands of lives lost during the D-Day operation.

<summary>Description</summary>

> These circular walls belong to Pueblo Bonito, one of the biggest great homes in Chaco Culture National Historical Park, New Mexico. Between around 850 CE and 1250 CE, Chaco Canyon became a major cultural center for the Ancestral Puebloans, who lived in what is now known as the Four Corners region.
> 
> With long winters, little rain, and short growing seasons, the high desert wasn't the easiest place to live but the Pueblo people found ways to thrive here. Today, the park offers a glimpse into an ancient culture's traditions and way of life. The site is home to remnants of prehistoric ceremonial and massive stone buildings, called great houses. Pueblo Bonito, pictured on our homepage, took decades to build and stood four or five stories tall with more than 600 rooms. It would have been used for ceremonies, commerce, astronomy, hospitality, and more. Eventually, Chaco's influence declined, and the people moved on. These ruins are a window onto its glorious past, at the heart of an ancient civilization.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Oceans cover more than 70% of the Earth's surface, so it's no surprise they play a crucial role in our planet's climate and ecosystem, supporting a huge amount of marine life. Humpback whales, like the one in our homepage image, can be found in all oceans and have among the world’s longest migrations, traveling thousands of miles from tropical breeding grounds to colder waters in search of food. They are also known for their haunting 'songs.' There are many theories about why they sing, but some research suggests it might be a sign of loneliness. The good news is, that a global ban on commercial whaling has seen their numbers increase, so there is less need for whales to feel lonely.
> 
> However, whales' aquatic environment is still at risk from climate change and human action. World Oceans Day is held on June 8 to remind us that the oceans are crucial for the survival of all life on Earth, producing at least half of all the planet's oxygen and home to most of its biodiversity, upon which we all depend.

> Welcome to Cappadocia, a historical region in Türkiye known for its fantastical landscape. A magical moment to enjoy here is watching dozens of hot air balloons rising into the dawn sky. Every sunrise and sunset gives life to the 'fairy chimneys' of this striking region, mysterious towering rock formations reaching up to 130 feet high. The unusual landscape was formed over millions of years by volcanic eruptions. Another attraction here that you won't see from the air is Derinkuyu, a city dating from 1400 BCE that is completely underground.

This wading bird is often referred to as the giant heron due to its enormous size—reaching as tall as 5 feet in height with up to a 7-foot wingspan. The goliath heron is a solitary creature, known for its slow, hunting-style movements and lives around lakes, swamps, and wetlands. They forage in deep waters and feast on large fish, like mullet and tilapia, as well as small animals including frogs, snakes, and lizards. They are often found in sub-Saharan Africa, with smaller numbers in western and southern regions of Asia.

Its slow-moving blackwaters are stained by tannins from decaying organic matter and this vast ecosystem, covering 700 square miles, is packed with wildlife. Herons, cranes, bitterns, American alligators, turtles, snakes, frogs, and Florida black bears are among creatures who roam the swamp, which is largely protected by the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge. In the early years of the 20th century, part of the swamp was logged, and its peat deposits were mined for use as fuel.

The first version had 13 stripes and 13 stars to symbolize the original colonies that eventually formed the United States of America. On June 14, we commemorate the flag’s adoption at the Second Continental Congress in 1777. Initially, it was rarely seen beyond military and government buildings and ships, but it became an icon of American identity during the Civil War. Today, the Stars and Stripes will fly at Flag Day parades and ceremonies, as the country celebrates its symbolism and history.

> International Surfing Day promotes the protection of the ocean alongside celebrating the sport itself, every year on the third Saturday in June. People gather for surfing contests, barbeques, beach cleanups, and other activities to help restore the ocean environment. Coming together for a cause is a hallmark of the global surfing community, whether campaigning for cleaner waters or standing together against injustice, as they did at the Paddle Out for Unity gathering in 2020 in Encinitas, California, pictured on our homepage.
> 
> Surfing traces back to 12th-century Polynesia, whose people carried the tradition to Hawaii. The sport made its US debut in 1885 near Santa Cruz, California, when four Hawaiian princes surfed the San Lorenzo River on redwood boards. Today, surfing has expanded around the world.

> Father's Day may appear to go hand in hand with Mother's Day, but this wasn't always the case. It was proposed by Sonora Smart Dodd, who believed fathers should have their own celebration, perhaps motivated by the inaugural Mother's Day of 1908. Father's Day was first celebrated in 1910 and was recognized by President Woodrow Wilson six years later. It fell out of popular practice in the 1920s but eventually regained popularity—partly due to marketing—and was set as a permanent national observance by President Richard Nixon in 1972. Our homepage image today shows a common tern papa, doing his bit for the family—with this species, both parents build the nest and incubate the eggs.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Juneteenth is here, a day celebrating the freedom of enslaved African Americans shortly after the end of the Civil War. While Abraham Lincoln's final Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863 freed slaves in Confederate states, certain areas did not abolish slavery until months after Confederate forces surrendered. Texas issued an order on June 19, 1865, that 'all slaves are free.' This act was the origin of Juneteenth, which combines the words June and nineteenth. However, slavery did not fully end in the US until the 13th Amendment was ratified on December 6, 1865.
> 
> The holiday has been recognized in every state since 1979. Modern celebrations and jubilees include concerts, marches, fairs, and buildings lit up with red, black, and green like we see in our photo. Juneteenth offers us the opportunity to celebrate progress while also challenging ourselves to identify the ongoing work that needs to be done.

> Bald eagles are a symbol of strength, determination, and courage. The powerful bird is celebrated every year on June 20, the day it was made the national symbol of the United States in 1782. President Bill Clinton commemorated this date by declaring it American Eagle Day in 1995. The bald eagle, named for its white-feathered head, was once an endangered bird, but conservation efforts and the Endangered Species Act have helped boost its numbers.
> 
> Today's image was taken in the Tongass National Forest in southeast Alaska, which has the highest nesting density of bald eagles in the world. Eagles are picky when it comes to selecting a tree in which to nest. They like tall ones that offer a good view of their surroundings. This majestic bird stands as a proud reminder of the principles of liberty and independence that the nation was founded upon.

> The ancient monument of Stonehenge has fascinated people for centuries. Estimated to have been built between 3000 and 2000 BCE in the English county of Wiltshire, its large standing stones remain an enigma. Exactly why and how this massive stone circle was built are still debated. What we do know, is that it was done without metal tools or the use of wheels—and some of those stones were moved more than 150 miles.
> 
> On the summer solstice, the longest day of the year, the sun rises directly over the largest stone, the Heel Stone, creating a captivating spectacle. On the winter solstice, the shortest day, the sunset aligns with the stones, casting an enchanting glow upon the ancient site. Stonehenge's precise alignment with astronomical events suggests its importance in ancient ceremonial practices, making it an iconic symbol of human ingenuity and our connection to the cosmos.

> Welcome to the largest tropical rainforest on Earth. Our homepage image was taken in Peru, home to about 13% of the Amazon rainforest. Most of it, about 60%, is in Brazil, while 10% is in Colombia. Bolivia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela also have sections within their borders. Covering nearly 40% of South America, the rainforest is teeming with life, including endangered species like jaguars and giant otters, more than 40,000 plants, and thousands of birds and butterflies. Millions of people also live in the Amazon.
> 
> As well as sheltering thousands of species, rainforests absorb a substantial amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping to combat global warming. But they are threatened by climate change and deforestation. World Rainforest Day was created in 2017 to celebrate these critical natural resources and to raise awareness of their plight. Its founders, the Rainforest Partnership, also hosts a summit to hear from experts and discuss how individuals and communities can help protect rainforests.

> It's lunch time for these beautiful monarch butterflies, which like to feed on clusters of colorful wildflowers. While they dine out on nectar, they get a light dusting of pollen, which is then spread to other flowers they land on. This process is pollination, transferring pollen from the male part of a flower to the female part, and is crucial for growing many of our fruits and vegetables. It improves the quality and quantity of crops and increases harvest yields. Nearly $20 billion of goods are produced in the US alone each year, because of pollination.
> 
> Pollinators are a critical part of food systems and ecosystems, but their numbers have declined due to various threats including loss of habitats, pesticides, and climate change. Pollinator Week, held in June each year, aims to raise awareness of pollinators and what we can do to protect them. You can mark the week by avoiding using pesticides and creating a pollinator-friendly habitat for butterflies, bees, and other pollinators, helping them continue to play their essential role in plant reproduction.

> Welcome to the ancient temple of Al-Khazneh in the desert city of Petra, Jordan. Carved out of a single sandstone rock about 2,000 years ago by the Nabataean people, it is believed to have been a mausoleum for King Aretas IV. Standing 141 feet tall, its massive doorway is framed with towering columns and intricate carvings. It is the most recognizable structure of this 'rose city' of temples and tombs carved from pink sandstone.
> 
> The Nabataeans, the original inhabitants of Petra, were skilled architects who built an impressive network of cisterns and water channels here. Once a thriving center, Petra is thought to have been largely abandoned around the 8th century and was 'lost' to the Western world until the 19th century. Only the Bedouin people, who lived in the surrounding desert, knew of it, and it is they who are thought to have named it Al-Khazneh, believing it contained treasures.

> The Château de Villandry in France is renowned for its exquisite gardens that are considered a masterpiece of Renaissance horticulture. The gardens, which are divided into sections, feature geometric patterns, vibrant flowerbeds, serene water elements, and meticulously trimmed hedges. Each section has its own theme, ranging from ornamental to practical, and is bursting with a stunning blend of colors and textures. The château's gardens showcase the harmonious relationship between architecture and nature. Stunning gardens have surrounded the château since it was built in 1532, but their appearance changed drastically over the centuries. After Joachim Carvallo acquired the estate, he spent 10 years from 1918 reinventing and restoring the Renaissance formal gardens. Other elements have been added in the decades since and the gardens continue to captivate visitors to this day.
