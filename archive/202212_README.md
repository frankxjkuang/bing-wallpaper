<summary>Description</summary>

> The most isolated continent in the world is hands down the polar desert that is Antarctica, the coldest, driest, and windiest continent on Earth. Inhospitable as it sounds, Antarctica, which lies almost completely below the Antarctic Circle, is also a place of stunning beauty as evidenced by this image of Paradise Harbour, aka Paradise Bay, near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. Antarctica is also extraordinarily vulnerable to the effects of climate change, worth remembering today on Antarctica Day, which marks the anniversary of the signing of the 1959 Antarctic Treaty. The international agreement protects Antarctica as a scientific preserve.
> 
> The Antarctic Peninsula is the northernmost part of Antarctica and the closest to South America, making it relatively accessible. Paradise Harbour is one of the most-visited places on the continent, and a regular stop for cruise ships. The area is home to a thriving colony of penguins and is an excellent place to see glacial calving. While the loss of glacial ice is normal, the process has accelerated at an alarming rate due to global warming. The mile-thick ice sheet that covers Antarctica accounts for 70% of the planet's supply of fresh water. To put that in perspective, if it all melted, sea levels would rise by 200 feet. Without this land of ice, the world would look a lot different.

<summary>Description</summary>

> On this day in 1980, the single largest expansion of protected lands in history doubled the size of the US National Park System. As a result, Alaska now has eight national parks, plus numerous monuments and preserves that protect more than 157 million total acres. When President Jimmy Carter signed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, the public was granted the right to appreciate stunning locations like the one in today's photo: the braided river delta of the 51-mile-long Tlikakila River in Lake Clark National Park.
> 
> In the native Athabaskan language, Tlikakila literally means 'salmon are there river.' The park is known for its salmon-laden waterways and the fish are of major importance to the local economy and ecosystem. Local bear populations benefit from the excess salmon, and bear watching is very popular at Lake Clark. The abundance of salmon has also benefited a wolf pack within the park—the only one in the world known to be solely dependent on salmon.

Art Basel Miami Beach, which wraps up its three-day run today, is the American leg of an international art fair also staged in Basel, Switzerland (where the festival started in 1970), Hong Kong, and Paris. The event, now 20 years old, is the most comprehensive contemporary art fair in North America, attracting thousands of artists, dealers, collectors, appreciators, and just fun-seeking tourists for this annual burst of creativity steps from the sand.

Tanzania's Mount Kilimanjaro, known as the Great White Mountain to local tribes, stands sentinel as these African bush elephants cross the vast savannahs of Amboseli National Park in Kenya.

<summary>Description</summary>

> We're used to Santa Claus sliding down chimneys, but who knew he could ski? Thousands of Santa Clauses make a stunning downhill display to open the ski season in Verbier, Switzerland, each year. Why the costumes? Their annual descent also celebrates the feast day of Saint Nicholas, observed in Europe on December 5 and in the US on December 6.
> 
> Little is known historically of Saint Nicholas, but he's thought to have grown up under the Roman Empire, in a wealthy Greek family in what's now southern Turkey. When his parents died, he used his inheritance to help those in need, the sick, and the suffering—even tossing gifts through strangers' open windows (not chimneys) now and then. Nicholas   joined the early Christian clergy as a bishop, dedicating his life to serving others generously. It's said he loved and helped children especially, and that, of course, is at the root of the legend of Santa Claus.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> We're heading down to Florida today to celebrate the 75th year of Everglades National Park, the largest tropical wilderness in the United States. The park was established in 1947 to defend a fragile ecosystem and covers about 20% of the entire Everglades wetland. But even with the park service's protection, the Everglades' features, primarily shallow freshwater pools, have suffered significantly due to human activity.
> 
> For example, the park is the most important North American breeding ground for wading birds, like the great egret seen in today's photo. Though great egrets are a robust and widespread species, breeding pairs in the park have declined to a tenth of what they once were. And great egrets are just one of 40 species native to Florida listed as endangered or threatened in the Everglades—so one can see why this unique corner of the country demands protection.

American botanist and government representative Joel Roberts Poinsett introduced the scarlet foliage to the US in 1828. Flash forward to the 1960s, when a breeding program resulted in hardier, fuller plants and many variations. The booming poinsettia wholesale trade in the US brings in a whopping $250 million a year. The House of Representatives designated December 12 as Poinsettia Day in 2002. Poinsettias are the top-selling potted plant in the US and Canada, brightening holiday tables every December.

That's thanks to a special split hoof that allows them to grip rocky slopes.
