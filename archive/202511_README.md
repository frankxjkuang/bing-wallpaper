> The bison embodies a paradox: immense strength paired with quiet calm. Weighing up to 2,000 pounds and standing 6 feet tall, these giants roam North America's grasslands and river valleys in mobile herds. Photographed here in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, they once numbered in the tens of millions but were nearly eradicated in the 19th century—a loss that reshaped ecosystems and disrupted lifeways.
> 
> Today, on National Bison Day, observed each year in early November, we honor this iconic species' persistence and profound significance. It's only fitting that this celebration falls at the start of Native American Heritage Month: for countless Native Nations, these animals have been revered as teachers, providers, and spiritual relatives, with every part used thoughtfully for sustenance, clothing, tools, and fuel. That's why tribal communities lead efforts to help them reclaim prairie, wetland, and forest habitats, forming social herds led by matriarchs, sparring males, and curious calves.

> Today, we travel to the Arashiyama district in Kyoto, renowned for its captivating seasonal landscapes. Here, vibrant Japanese maple trees and serene bamboo forests create a harmonious blend of color and tranquility. These maples, known for their delicate, deeply lobed leaves, turn fiery shades of red, orange, and gold during fall, attracting visitors from around the world. They are celebrated not only for their beauty but also for their cultural symbolism—representing elegance, peace, and the fleeting nature of life.
> 
> The Sagano Bamboo Forest is equally iconic, where towering stalks of madake and mosochiku varieties of bamboo sway gently in the breeze. Bamboo has been integral to Japanese life for centuries, used in everything from architecture and crafts to traditional ceremonies. Its rapid growth and resilience symbolize strength and flexibility, and bamboo groves were historically planted to protect against natural disasters.

> They don't have brains, bones, or even hearts, yet jellyfish have pulsed through Earth's oceans for half a billion years. Today, on World Jellyfish Day, these wobbly wonders get their moment in the sun—or at least under the sea. The day promotes efforts to protect jellyfish habitats from threats like pollution, nutrient-rich runoff, and ocean acidification.
> 
> Don't be fooled by the 'fish' in their name: they belong to the invertebrate club called Cnidaria, and they're made up of about 95% water. With their bell-shaped bodies and trailing tentacles, they're more like ocean drifters than deep-sea athletes. Some glow like the one pictured here in the Pacific Ocean off Guerrero, Mexico, others pack stings, and a select few, like the 'immortal jellyfish,' can reset their life cycle and start again.
> 
> Jellyfish are vital links in the food chain, feeding turtles, sunfish, and seabirds. Their sudden population booms also act as alarms, signaling changes in the ocean caused by warming waters and overfishing. So today, let's give credit where credit is due—to the brainless blobs that have outlived dinosaurs, mastered the art of drifting, and proved that sometimes being spineless is actually a strength.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Some bridges connect two sides. Tower Bridge connects history, engineering, and a flair for drama. Standing next to the Tower of London and rising over the River Thames since 1894, this London icon literally knows how to lift spirits—and traffic. With its twin towers, blue-and-white paintwork, and bascules that open like a giant's drawbridge, Tower Bridge is less a traffic solution and more a stage performer.
> 
> When it was first built, London needed a crossing that wouldn't block river trade. The answer? A bridge that could split in half and rise high enough for sailing ships to pass through. Victorian ingenuity powered the hydraulics with steam engines; today, oil and electricity do the heavy lifting. Visitors can step inside to explore its engine rooms and stroll across the high-level glass walkways for a bird's-eye view of the Thames. From its Gothic-style towers to its lifting bascules, the structure continues to bridge the gap between past and present, proving that sometimes, the best way forward is to raise the road.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Spain's Aragon region isn't exactly famous for its forests—it's more 'sun and scrub' than 'shade and shuffle.' And yet, climb the slopes of Moncayo and you'll walk straight into a twist ending: a dense, whispering beech forest. The mountain is a climate roller coaster. At the bottom? Mediterranean shrubs. Midway up? Oaks and pines. Push further? Suddenly you're in Peña Roya, a beech wonderland that seems to say, 'Surprise, leaf it to me!'
> 
> Fall is their show-off season. The forest becomes a patchwork quilt of red, gold, and orange, while hikers crunch happily through the leaves. Deer tiptoe through the trees, wild boar snuffle in the undergrowth, and birds like Eurasian goshawks and golden eagles supply the soundtrack. And just when you think it's all about trees, Moncayo reminds you of its human side: monasteries tucked into the mountainside, hermitages clinging to rocks, and villages that once treated the forest as their pantry. Today, people come not for timber, but for trails, photos, and that sweet mountain air.

> 北极熊是一种大型熊类，原产于北极及其附近地区。加拿大曼尼托巴省的丘吉尔是一个北极熊出没的地方。每年秋天，数百只北极熊聚集在这里，等待海湾结冰，以便再次捕猎海豹——它们的主要食物来源。有没有想过它们是如何保暖的？厚厚的脂肪层和浓密的底毛可以锁住热量。它们游过后，不易缠结的毛发会被甩干，天然油脂可以防止皮毛结冻。遗憾的是，气温升高会延缓结冰过程，迫使北极熊禁食更长时间。为了应对延迟，它们会休息、保存能量，有时还会在附近游荡。科学家们追踪它们的行踪，以了解迁徙模式每年的变化。北极熊周在纪念这些哺乳动物的同时，也提醒我们，它们的未来取决于我们如何应对全球变暖。

> 驶出101号公路，俄勒冈州的班登便迎来了来访者，这里弥漫着咸咸的空气和轻柔的港口钟声。这座小镇始建于19世纪50年代，最初只是个小聚居地，后来发展成为木材和鲑鱼捕捞中心。蔓越莓成为当地的主要作物，至今仍是每年九月蔓越莓节的庆祝活动。老城区的木板路咖啡馆和画廊反映了那段历史，而科基尔河灯塔则矗立在布拉兹海滩，经过修复，依然屹立在那里，提醒着人们当年它曾指引船只的航向。
> 
> 从灯塔步行一小段路即可到达海滩，那里展现着令人回味的海岸景观：班登的海蚀柱，正如今天图片中所展现的那样。这些地貌经过数千年的海浪、风蚀和缓慢崩塌的侵蚀，讲述着一段地质故事。面岩（Face Rock）形似当地传说中少女翘起的下巴。附近的巫师帽（Wizard's Hat）像一顶尖顶的帽子，直冲云霄；大象岩（Elephant Rock）拱起，如同一条伸向潮水的象鼻。其他值得注意的景观包括贝壳角（Coquille Point）、桌岩（Table Rock）以及猫和小猫（Cat and Kittens）海蚀柱。作为俄勒冈群岛国家野生动物保护区的一部分，这些海蚀柱为海鸟提供了庇护，并展现了海洋和时间的坚韧力量。

<summary>Description</summary>

> Pull off of Highway 101, and Bandon, Oregon, greets you with salty air and the clang of harbor bells. The town began as a small settlement in the 1850s and grew into a center for timber and salmon fishing. Cranberries became a key crop and are still celebrated each September during the Cranberry Festival. Old Town reflects that past with boardwalk cafés and galleries, while the Coquille River Lighthouse stands restored at Bullards Beach as a reminder of the days when its beacon guided ships.
> 
> A short walk from the lighthouse leads to the beach where an evocative coastal landscape unfolds: Bandon's sea stacks, featured in today's image. Sculpted over millennia by waves, wind, and the slow collapse of arches, these formations tell a geologic story. Face Rock resembles the tilted chin of a maiden from local legend. Nearby, Wizard's Hat rises like a pointed cap against the sky, and Elephant Rock arches like a trunk reaching for the tide. Other notable shapes include Coquille Point, Table Rock, and the Cat and Kittens stacks. Protected as part of the Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge, these stones shelter seabirds and reveal the patient force of ocean and time.

> The universe hums with creation. Featured here, in the Lagoon Nebula, a cluster called NGC 6530 is kindling newborn stars, a glowing reminder that beginnings are woven into the fabric of the cosmos. About 4,350 light-years away and a few million years old, it is a stellar formation still in its earliest chapter.
> 
> The world celebrates Carl Sagan Day every November 9 to honor the astronomer who shared distant wonders through stories people could understand. Founded in 2009, the day is observed worldwide, marked by lectures, planetarium shows, and stargazing nights that carry Sagan's call for scientific curiosity.
> 
> Carl Sagan's legacy stretches from NASA's Voyager missions and the Golden Record to his Cosmos television series, inspiring millions to see science as both reason and a source of endless possibilities. At Cornell University, home to the Carl Sagan Institute, his vision continues through the search for habitable worlds and the celebration of cosmic discovery. In the night sky, NGC 6530 offers a fitting tribute: a nursery of suns forming within clouds of gas and dust, echoing Sagan's reminder that 'We are made of star stuff.'
