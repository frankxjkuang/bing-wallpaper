> The bison embodies a paradox: immense strength paired with quiet calm. Weighing up to 2,000 pounds and standing 6 feet tall, these giants roam North America's grasslands and river valleys in mobile herds. Photographed here in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, they once numbered in the tens of millions but were nearly eradicated in the 19th century—a loss that reshaped ecosystems and disrupted lifeways.
> 
> Today, on National Bison Day, observed each year in early November, we honor this iconic species' persistence and profound significance. It's only fitting that this celebration falls at the start of Native American Heritage Month: for countless Native Nations, these animals have been revered as teachers, providers, and spiritual relatives, with every part used thoughtfully for sustenance, clothing, tools, and fuel. That's why tribal communities lead efforts to help them reclaim prairie, wetland, and forest habitats, forming social herds led by matriarchs, sparring males, and curious calves.

> Today, we travel to the Arashiyama district in Kyoto, renowned for its captivating seasonal landscapes. Here, vibrant Japanese maple trees and serene bamboo forests create a harmonious blend of color and tranquility. These maples, known for their delicate, deeply lobed leaves, turn fiery shades of red, orange, and gold during fall, attracting visitors from around the world. They are celebrated not only for their beauty but also for their cultural symbolism—representing elegance, peace, and the fleeting nature of life.
> 
> The Sagano Bamboo Forest is equally iconic, where towering stalks of madake and mosochiku varieties of bamboo sway gently in the breeze. Bamboo has been integral to Japanese life for centuries, used in everything from architecture and crafts to traditional ceremonies. Its rapid growth and resilience symbolize strength and flexibility, and bamboo groves were historically planted to protect against natural disasters.

> They don't have brains, bones, or even hearts, yet jellyfish have pulsed through Earth's oceans for half a billion years. Today, on World Jellyfish Day, these wobbly wonders get their moment in the sun—or at least under the sea. The day promotes efforts to protect jellyfish habitats from threats like pollution, nutrient-rich runoff, and ocean acidification.
> 
> Don't be fooled by the 'fish' in their name: they belong to the invertebrate club called Cnidaria, and they're made up of about 95% water. With their bell-shaped bodies and trailing tentacles, they're more like ocean drifters than deep-sea athletes. Some glow like the one pictured here in the Pacific Ocean off Guerrero, Mexico, others pack stings, and a select few, like the 'immortal jellyfish,' can reset their life cycle and start again.
> 
> Jellyfish are vital links in the food chain, feeding turtles, sunfish, and seabirds. Their sudden population booms also act as alarms, signaling changes in the ocean caused by warming waters and overfishing. So today, let's give credit where credit is due—to the brainless blobs that have outlived dinosaurs, mastered the art of drifting, and proved that sometimes being spineless is actually a strength.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Some bridges connect two sides. Tower Bridge connects history, engineering, and a flair for drama. Standing next to the Tower of London and rising over the River Thames since 1894, this London icon literally knows how to lift spirits—and traffic. With its twin towers, blue-and-white paintwork, and bascules that open like a giant's drawbridge, Tower Bridge is less a traffic solution and more a stage performer.
> 
> When it was first built, London needed a crossing that wouldn't block river trade. The answer? A bridge that could split in half and rise high enough for sailing ships to pass through. Victorian ingenuity powered the hydraulics with steam engines; today, oil and electricity do the heavy lifting. Visitors can step inside to explore its engine rooms and stroll across the high-level glass walkways for a bird's-eye view of the Thames. From its Gothic-style towers to its lifting bascules, the structure continues to bridge the gap between past and present, proving that sometimes, the best way forward is to raise the road.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Spain's Aragon region isn't exactly famous for its forests—it's more 'sun and scrub' than 'shade and shuffle.' And yet, climb the slopes of Moncayo and you'll walk straight into a twist ending: a dense, whispering beech forest. The mountain is a climate roller coaster. At the bottom? Mediterranean shrubs. Midway up? Oaks and pines. Push further? Suddenly you're in Peña Roya, a beech wonderland that seems to say, 'Surprise, leaf it to me!'
> 
> Fall is their show-off season. The forest becomes a patchwork quilt of red, gold, and orange, while hikers crunch happily through the leaves. Deer tiptoe through the trees, wild boar snuffle in the undergrowth, and birds like Eurasian goshawks and golden eagles supply the soundtrack. And just when you think it's all about trees, Moncayo reminds you of its human side: monasteries tucked into the mountainside, hermitages clinging to rocks, and villages that once treated the forest as their pantry. Today, people come not for timber, but for trails, photos, and that sweet mountain air.

> 北极熊是一种大型熊类，原产于北极及其附近地区。加拿大曼尼托巴省的丘吉尔是一个北极熊出没的地方。每年秋天，数百只北极熊聚集在这里，等待海湾结冰，以便再次捕猎海豹——它们的主要食物来源。有没有想过它们是如何保暖的？厚厚的脂肪层和浓密的底毛可以锁住热量。它们游过后，不易缠结的毛发会被甩干，天然油脂可以防止皮毛结冻。遗憾的是，气温升高会延缓结冰过程，迫使北极熊禁食更长时间。为了应对延迟，它们会休息、保存能量，有时还会在附近游荡。科学家们追踪它们的行踪，以了解迁徙模式每年的变化。北极熊周在纪念这些哺乳动物的同时，也提醒我们，它们的未来取决于我们如何应对全球变暖。

> Pull off of Highway 101, and Bandon, Oregon, greets you with salty air and the clang of harbor bells. The town began as a small settlement in the 1850s and grew into a center for timber and salmon fishing. Cranberries became a key crop and are still celebrated each September during the Cranberry Festival. Old Town reflects that past with boardwalk cafés and galleries, while the Coquille River Lighthouse stands restored at Bullards Beach as a reminder of the days when its beacon guided ships.
> 
> A short walk from the lighthouse leads to the beach where an evocative coastal landscape unfolds: Bandon's sea stacks, featured in today's image. Sculpted over millennia by waves, wind, and the slow collapse of arches, these formations tell a geologic story. Face Rock resembles the tilted chin of a maiden from local legend. Nearby, Wizard's Hat rises like a pointed cap against the sky, and Elephant Rock arches like a trunk reaching for the tide. Other notable shapes include Coquille Point, Table Rock, and the Cat and Kittens stacks. Protected as part of the Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge, these stones shelter seabirds and reveal the patient force of ocean and time.

<summary>Description</summary>

> On November 10, 47 years ago, a stark stretch of South Dakota prairie gained recognition as one of America's natural treasures. Badlands National Park, carved by wind and water, was redesignated from national monument to national park status in 1978, securing stronger protection within the National Park System. Its cliffs and spires rise above fossil beds that reveal ancient rhinoceroses, camels, and subtropical seas. Yet the park is not only a window into the past; it also safeguards one of the largest remaining tracts of mixed-grass prairie in the US.
> 
> The prairie hums with life. Bison roam the open range, bighorn sheep climb steep bluffs, and prairie dogs build underground colonies, known as 'towns,' that can stretch for miles. Roberts Prairie Dog Town, where today's image was captured, is the park's largest accessible colony, supporting nearly 200 plant and animal species. Once labeled pests, prairie dogs are now recognized as keystone species, as they give rise to soil aeration and plant diversity. The park's anniversary marks its redesignation, but also reminds us that the Badlands endures not just as a rugged formation, but as a living and breathing prairie.

> Think modern sports are dramatic? Ancient Romans had front-row seats to spectacles far more intense inside the Colosseum. Commissioned by the Flavian emperor Vespasian in 72 CE and finished by his son Titus in 80 CE, this amphitheater broke tradition with its predecessors that were built into hillsides for natural support. Instead, the Colosseum was a fully free-standing architectural giant. Crafted from stone and concrete, its arches and vaults supported an arena that could host up to 50,000 spectators. Gladiators, exotic animals, and even staged sea battles thrilled the crowds, while hidden elevators and trapdoors created sudden, dramatic appearances.
> 
> During the Middle Ages, the Colosseum found new purposes: first as a church, later as a fortress. Over the centuries, it endured damage from lightning strikes, earthquakes, and pollution. Much of its marble and travertine was also reused in palaces, fortifications, and even churches—a practice known as 'spolia,' which quite literally wove pieces of the structure into the evolving city of Rome. It wasn't until the 19th century that serious preservation began. Today, recognized as a protected monument and welcoming nearly 7 million visitors annually, the Colosseum remains one of Italy's most iconic landmarks.

> Of all the plants on Earth, the quiver tree looks the most like a vision from the future. Found in Southern Africa, including parts of Namibia, these striking giants are not true trees but a species of aloe adapted to life under the desert's scorching sun. Their thick trunks store water, while their branches reflect heat, helping them endure harsh conditions. Reaching up to 23 feet in height, with some living for more than 100 years, quiver trees are also vital to their ecosystem. They offer rare perches and nesting sites for birds in landscapes where few other trees exist.
> 
> The name 'quiver' comes from the Indigenous San people, who once hollowed out the branches to craft lightweight arrow holders, or quivers. The Quiver Tree Forest near Keetmanshoop is a national monument and one of Namibia's most photographed sites. With some of the clearest skies on Earth, the desert provides a perfect backdrop for stargazing. In today's image, quiver trees stand silhouetted against the Milky Way. Though climate shifts are altering their natural range, these trees remain a symbol of Namibia's rugged beauty—and a reminder of how nature adapts in the most imaginative ways.

<summary>Description</summary>

> If you think the alphabet is straightforward, Japan's Irohazaka Road in Nikko will twist that belief right out of you. Named after the old Japanese syllabary 'Iroha,' this mountain pass once had 48 hairpin bends—each curve matched to a character of the alphabet. Today, it's a pair of separate one-way roads—one goes up, the other comes down, and both make drivers feel as if they're spelling out a story with every turn.
> 
> Fall is when Irohazaka truly shows off, as captured in today's image. From late October to early November, maple reds, ginkgo golds, and larch yellows spill down the slopes. The winding route also leads to some of Nikko's greatest hits. Climb up, and you'll reach the Akechidaira Plateau. Here, a ropeway gives you sweeping views of Lake Chuzenji and the powerful Kegon Falls. At the top, Lake Chuzenji offers a calm contrast to the dizzying drive, while the waterfall roars below. Centuries ago, pilgrims took this same route to reach sacred shrines and temples. Today, travelers follow in their tracks, though probably with more camera clicks than chants.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In Lyon, France, you don't just walk through the city—you glide through it. The traboules, a network of hidden passageways threading between courtyards and buildings, turn a simple stroll into a treasure hunt. They were the original shortcuts, allowing residents to dodge rain, carry goods, or move discreetly through the medieval quarters. Today, they're less about practicality and more about discovery. These passages date back to the fourth century but became essential during the Renaissance, when silk traders used them to shuttle delicate fabrics safely from workshops to the river without braving the weather. Later, during World War II, Resistance fighters used the traboules as escape routes.
> 
> Most of Lyon's traboules are tucked away in the Vieux Lyon and Croix-Rousse districts. Push open what looks like an ordinary wooden door, and you might step into a courtyard with spiral staircases, arched galleries, and stone corridors that snake between buildings. Some passages are public, some private, and all of them blur the line between indoors and outdoors. Walking a traboule is like flipping through the city's footnotes. You're right in the heart of a living neighborhood, yet moving through centuries of history.

> National Take a Hike Day is more than a date—it's an invitation to step away from screens and into the rhythm of nature. Created by the American Hiking Society, this day celebrates the simple act of walking under open skies and reminds us that health and happiness often begin with a single stride. Across 60,000 miles of US trails, hikers rediscover the quiet magic of forests, the strength in their own breath, and the promise of unspoiled landscapes.
> 
> And then there's Shenandoah National Park, Virginia's mountain jewel. Here, the Blue Ridge Mountains wear their finest colors—golden hickories, crimson maples, and oaks brushed in bronze. By November, the air turns crisp, and the last embers of fall cling to the hillsides like whispered secrets. Skyline Drive winds for 105 miles, offering vistas where clouds drift like thoughts across endless valleys. Trails—more than 500 miles of them—lead to places where waterfalls tumble and summits greet the horizon. Stony Man, Hawksbill, Dark Hollow Falls—each a poem written in stone and leaf, waiting for footsteps to rhyme with the wind.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Step closer, and the details begin to speak—every stone, spire, and statue seems to hold a story of its own. Conceived in the late 19th century, the Hungarian Parliament Building was designed to reflect a nation's ambition, blending Gothic Revival elegance with distinctly Hungarian motifs. Architect Imre Steindl's vision took shape over two decades through the work of more than 1,000 craftsmen. Even the central dome, rising 315 feet (96 meters) high, carries meaning: the height honors the year of Hungary's millennium anniversary in 1896. Completed in 1904, the building still dominates Budapest's skyline as a powerful national symbol.
> 
> Step inside, and the richness deepens. Gold leaf shimmers across staircases and halls, while statues of rulers and national figures line the corridors, turning history into spectacle. Beyond its political role, the Parliament has become a cultural emblem—hosting state ceremonies, welcoming millions of visitors annually, and earning UNESCO World Heritage status. More than a landmark, it continues to tell Hungary's story through the details that first inspired its creation.

This scene unfolds in 'World in Progress II,' a monumental land art painting created by Swiss-French artist Saype in 2020.

What began in 1954 as a UN initiative grew into a landmark observance anchored by two historic milestones: the 1959 Declaration and the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child. These commitments have carved a global promise—one that speaks of education, equality, safety, and the simple right to be heard.

> This harbor seal, photographed at Robert Moses State Park on Long Island, New York, seems to be onto something—spreading good vibes, one wave at a time. That's exactly the spirit of World Hello Day, celebrated every November 21. This cheerful observance began in 1973 when two American brothers, Brian and Michael McCormack, launched it as a peaceful response to global tensions. They mailed 1,360 letters in seven languages to world leaders, inviting them to join the first celebration. Their message was simple yet powerful: personal communication can help preserve peace. Today, people in more than 180 countries participate.

> There are big statues—and then there's the Leshan Giant Buddha. Carved into a riverside cliff at the confluence of the Min, Qingyi, and Dadu Rivers in Sichuan, China, this statue is an ancient engineering marvel. Construction began in 713 CE under a monk named Hai Tong, who hoped that the Buddha's presence would calm dangerous river currents that threatened passing boats. He was so devoted that when funding ran out, he reportedly gouged out his own eyes to prove his sincerity. Construction took roughly 90 years and was completed long after Hai Tong's death. At 233 feet tall, it is the largest stone Buddha in the world. Its shoulders stretch about 92 feet wide, its ears measure nearly 23 feet long, and each foot extends over 28 feet. Drainage channels built inside the statue protect it from erosion, helping explain its remarkable preservation for more than 12 centuries.

> Together with the Mount Emei Scenic Area, the Leshan Giant Buddha became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Although time, weather, and pollution have taken their toll, continuous conservation work ensures it remains one of China's most treasured cultural landmarks.

> Look closely at this ammonite fossil. Its swirling shell, once home to a prehistoric sea creature, holds a mathematical secret—a spiral pattern. Each new chamber is proportionally larger than the previous one, maintaining a consistent growth ratio, often associated with the Fibonacci sequence.
> 
> Each November 23, we celebrate Fibonacci Day, named after the 13th-century Italian mathematician Leonardo Bonacci (Fibonacci), who introduced the concept to Europe. The pattern 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8…—where each number is the sum of the two before it—was, however, first described in India as early as 200 BCE by the ancient poet-mathematician Pingala. The Fibonacci sequence appears widely in nature, including pineapples, artichokes, pinecones, and the arrangement of leaves on a stem.
> 
> Ammonites were mollusks that lived between 400 and 66 million years ago, gliding through ancient seas inside coiled shells that protected their soft bodies. When ammonites perished, sediment buried their shells, and minerals slowly turned them to stone, preserving this natural geometry for millions of years. Today, the ammonite fossil is a striking reminder that math and nature speak the same language.

Towering over the skyline, Gwalior Fort is a 6th-century hill fort shaped by generations of rulers and wrapped in legend. Nicknamed 'the Gibraltar of India,' this fort was praised by Mughal emperor Babur as the 'pearl among the fortresses of Hind' for its strength and grandeur. The fort has seen rulers from the Tomars to the Mughals and is linked to battles, royal intrigue, and hidden treasures.
> 
> The fort has six palaces, two of which were built by Raja Man Singh Tomar, who reigned from 1486 to 1516. The architecture reflects a blend of Hindu and Mughal styles. Key landmarks include the Man Mandir Palace, with its turquoise-tiled exterior, and the Sas-Bahu Temples, dedicated to Lord Aniruddha and Lord Shiva. Teli Temple, a rectangular shrine without pillared pavilions, stands out among other such structures. Secret passages and hidden vaults hint at treasures long rumored to be stored inside.

Completed in 1762, it marks the endpoint of one of ancient Rome's earliest aqueducts, the Aqua Virgo, which still supplies water today. The name 'Trevi' comes from Tre Vie—'three roads'—signifying the junction where it stands. Designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi and finished by Giuseppe Pannini, this 86-foot marvel is the largest Baroque fountain in the city and one of the most famous in the world. Its sculptures show Oceanus, the god of the sea, surrounded by Tritons and horses.

Legend says one coin guarantees a return to Rome, two bring love, and three lead to marriage. Around $3,000 to $4,000 worth of coins are thrown daily—roughly $1.5 million a year—all donated to charity. From the iconic 1960 film 'La Dolce Vita' to LEGO's Trevi Fountain set, and even a replica near Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, this masterpiece still inspires. So, what would you wish for?

Today is Thanksgiving, when many Americans gather around the table, enjoying roast turkey stuffed with savory bread dressing, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, and pumpkin pie. Football games hum in the background, parades march down city streets, and kitchens buzz with the familiar aromas of holiday cooking.

> Accounts trace Thanksgiving back to 1621, when the Wampanoag people, the Indigenous stewards of the region, shared a meal with English settlers in Plymouth, Massachusetts and helped them survive their first harsh year. Yet the practice of giving thanks through feasting stretches much further back. Across North America, Indigenous communities held seasonal gatherings to honor the land, harvest, and social bonds—often including wild turkeys on the menu, long before the Pilgrims arrived.

Established in 2009, it celebrates the voices, art, and achievements of Indigenous peoples across the United States. This day is a reminder to look beyond parades and sales and learn from the experiences of those who first shaped this land. Communities host cultural events, storytelling sessions, and feasts featuring dishes like Three Sisters soup, wild rice, pemmican, beans, squash, and buffalo stew—each carrying centuries of legacy.

> Among the many traditions that shine today is the concho belt. Developed by Navajo artisans in the late 1860s, these belts combine skill and style. Originally made from Mexican silver pesos melted down and formed into ingots, they are now also crafted from nickel silver or German silver. The oval discs are stamped with designs that often represent natural elements like water, the sun, or butterflies, and some are adorned with turquoise stones. More than a fashion accessory, they are symbols of identity—stories worn proudly and passed down through generations like treasured heirlooms.

> Picture 21 square miles of open land, wildlife on the move, and a stag flaunting its crown of antlers. In 1909, husband and wife Anton Kröller and Helene Kröller-Müller began building a private estate in Gelderland, Netherlands—what we now know as De Hoge Veluwe National Park. Their vision? To merge art and nature. They brought it to life by placing artwork within the landscape, like 'Three Upright Motives' by English sculptor Henry Moore in the Pampelse Zand and the President Steyn stone bench by Belgian architect Henry van de Velde, among others.
> 
> Today, the park's forests, woodlands, sand dunes, and heathlands shelter wild boar, roe deer, mouflon, wolves, and countless birds. Yet red deer stags steal the show. Adult males weigh 350 to 530 pounds and stand about 40 to 50 inches at the shoulder. They graze on grass, leaves, and shoots, but also won't say no to fruit or acorns. During the rut, stags display their antlers and bellow to claim territory. They may not travel far, but their search for food and mates keeps the park alive with movement.

> Do you know what people bought at Christmas markets 567 years ago? Not costly ornaments or fancy souvenirs but candles, spices, local goods, knitted items, and toys. Leipzig's Christmas market began in 1458 and quickly became a favorite stop for merchants and locals alike. Today, with its cultural and culinary offerings spread across the historic old town and about 300 stalls, it is one of the largest Christmas markets in Germany. Imagine streets buzzing with the chatter of traders and children following the scent of 'Lebkuchen'—honey-sweetened cakes. This is where townsfolk gather to celebrate winter and catch up on news while sipping mulled wine. These markets have always symbolized more than shopping—they offer an escape from the everyday routine.
> 
> And what is a Christmas market without Santa Claus? In Leipzig, his grand arrival is a tradition. On the Saturday before Advent Sunday, families welcome Santa and his entourage, who arrive on a special train at the main station. Every corner of this city tells a story, from the historic St. Thomas Church to the merry-go-rounds that have delighted children for generations. As you walk through it, the festive spirit feels like a living story, blending centuries of customs with modern celebrations.
