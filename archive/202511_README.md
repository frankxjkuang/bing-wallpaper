> The bison embodies a paradox: immense strength paired with quiet calm. Weighing up to 2,000 pounds and standing 6 feet tall, these giants roam North America's grasslands and river valleys in mobile herds. Photographed here in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, they once numbered in the tens of millions but were nearly eradicated in the 19th century—a loss that reshaped ecosystems and disrupted lifeways.
> 
> Today, on National Bison Day, observed each year in early November, we honor this iconic species' persistence and profound significance. It's only fitting that this celebration falls at the start of Native American Heritage Month: for countless Native Nations, these animals have been revered as teachers, providers, and spiritual relatives, with every part used thoughtfully for sustenance, clothing, tools, and fuel. That's why tribal communities lead efforts to help them reclaim prairie, wetland, and forest habitats, forming social herds led by matriarchs, sparring males, and curious calves.

> Today, we travel to the Arashiyama district in Kyoto, renowned for its captivating seasonal landscapes. Here, vibrant Japanese maple trees and serene bamboo forests create a harmonious blend of color and tranquility. These maples, known for their delicate, deeply lobed leaves, turn fiery shades of red, orange, and gold during fall, attracting visitors from around the world. They are celebrated not only for their beauty but also for their cultural symbolism—representing elegance, peace, and the fleeting nature of life.
> 
> The Sagano Bamboo Forest is equally iconic, where towering stalks of madake and mosochiku varieties of bamboo sway gently in the breeze. Bamboo has been integral to Japanese life for centuries, used in everything from architecture and crafts to traditional ceremonies. Its rapid growth and resilience symbolize strength and flexibility, and bamboo groves were historically planted to protect against natural disasters.
