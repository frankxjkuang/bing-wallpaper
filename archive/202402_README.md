<summary>Description</summary>

> Born in New Orleans around the turn of the 20th century, with a sound that came from the blues, ragtime, and call-and-response vocals, jazz music is a notable chapter in Black history. You can almost hear John 'Dizzy' Gillespie playing his signature bent trumpet, featured on our homepage today. Gillespie made his name in bebop, often called the first modern form of jazz, playing alongside other greats including Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, and Thelonious Monk. Black musicians created genres like rock and roll, funk, hip-hop, and soul, the soundtrack to American culture and Black history.

> How long will winter last? Much depends on whether a certain groundhog sees his shadow today in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. On February 2, Punxsutawney Phil emerges from his tree stump, helped by members of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club's 'inner circle.' According to local legend, the same stocky groundhog has been predicting the weather since at least 1886 and if he sees his shadow, we can expect six more weeks of winter. If he does not, an early spring awaits.
> 
> Phil is said to make his prediction by choosing one of two scrolls, which top-hatted men then read out to the crowd, who cheer Phil on either way. Our homepage star today is a relative of Phil's, an alpine marmot, which has its own winter tradition of stocking up on food to prepare for a long hibernation. Let's hope that Phil doesn't see his shadow so we can exit our own.

> Don your tricorn hat and gilded disguise, it's time to visit the Carnival of Venice. This centuries-old festival combines revelry with anonymity, thanks to the masks traditionally worn by attendees, from the classic square-jawed Bauta mask to the Colombina eye mask, with roots in Italian theater. Costumed rowers take part in a parade of traditional boats on Venice's famous Grand Canal while thousands of people wearing elaborate costumes enjoy the carnival atmosphere. Parades, parties, concerts, and performances will fill the streets until festivities end on Shrove Tuesday, which falls on February 13 this year. Visitors might pass by the Santa Maria della Salute, seen toward the back of today's image, a baroque basilica dedicated to the Virgin Mary, who is considered to be the protector of the city.

> Step through time and into the cavernous depths of Devetashka Cave in Bulgaria, a sprawling prehistoric complex which humans called home for tens of thousands of years. These days, it is home to bats, about 30,000 of them, as well as rare birds and reptiles. This karst cave was formed by erosion and is now part of a public park. Humans are thought to have sought shelter here as far back as the Early Stone Age, about 70,000 years ago, and many Neolithic artefacts from 6000-4000 BCE have been discovered. Several large openings in the cave cast natural light into the chambers, offering better illumination for photographers and nature lovers alike.

> Western Monarch Day celebrates a stunning natural phenomenon, the annual migration of thousands of flame-colored butterflies to California. Traveling south to escape the winter weather, they use air currents to help them make journeys of hundreds of miles. They descend to gather in large numbers on eucalyptus trees, like the ones pictured on our homepage today in Goleta, Santa Barbara County. Those gathered to see clusters of butterflies in 100-foot-tall trees might confuse them for clumps of leaves at first. However, as the sun's rays gently fall upon them, their wings will begin to flutter. Bring your binoculars and take the opportunity to witness these winged wonders huddled together.

> This serene scene shows Lake Tahoe, the largest alpine lake in North America and the second-deepest lake in the US. Peeking out of those misty waters is Bonsai Rock, the unlikely home of four small trees that have taken root in its cracks. Its name was inspired by the Japanese art of growing miniature trees, which are kept in small containers and pruned to control their size. The trees on Bonsai Rock are naturally restricted by the lack of space and nutrients, so no pruning is required. Part of the purpose of bonsai is to provide an opportunity for contemplation, and this tranquil spot high in the Sierra Nevada is the perfect place to relax and explore your thoughts. It is also popular with photographers, especially at sunset.

> When British naturalist Charles Darwin arrived in the Galápagos Islands in 1835, he was already four years into a round-the-world voyage aboard the survey ship HMS Beagle. His observations on the remote volcanic islands in the eastern Pacific Ocean would help him to develop his famous theory of evolution through natural selection. While studying the creatures here, he concluded that many South American species, mainly reptiles and birds that could cross the vast expanse of water, had migrated to the Galápagos and gradually adapted to their surroundings.
> 
> Among animals Darwin encountered were Galápagos giant tortoises, like those featured on our homepage. They grow up to 5 feet in length but have different shaped shells, depending on which island they inhabit. The islands are named after these magnificent creatures, 'galápago' meaning freshwater tortoise in Spanish. Today, on International Darwin Day, let's celebrate these gentle giants, which contributed to one of the great scientific discoveries of the 19th century.

> 这些色彩斑斓的街道之间发生了什么？想象下有这样一个地方，大西洋轻抚着色彩斑斓的海岸，泰德峰从3715米的高度俯瞰着它。这个地方就是特内里费岛，西班牙加那利群岛上一个风景秀美四季如春的天堂。但当二月来临时，这座岛屿就会焕然一新：这是独属于圣克鲁斯-德特内里费的狂欢节时间，其视觉效果和节日盛况可与著名的巴西里约热内卢狂欢节相媲美，也被认为是世界上第二热门和知名的狂欢节。
> 
> 在这些日子里，整座城市充满着音乐、舞蹈和服饰，它们是真正的动态艺术品。当地人和游客欢聚一堂，跳起充满兄弟情谊和欢乐的舞蹈，每个剧团、每张面具都在讲述着一个独特的故事。特内里费狂欢节于1980年被视为国际兴趣的旅游节，此外，狂欢节还充满了奇趣，比如传统的“沙丁鱼的葬礼”，它标志着狂欢节庆典的结束和“大斋节”的到来。庆祝活动弘扬了岛屿文化，让每一位参加者都承诺在加那利的阳光下翩翩起舞。
> 
> 如果你不喜欢派对，特内里费岛还有更多值得一游的地方。特内里费岛的泰德国家公园被联合国教科文组织列为世界遗产，是世界上游客最多的公园之一，岛上还有丰富的建筑群、文化活动、广阔海滩和峭壁悬崖，当然也有让你流连忘返的天然海滨浴场。

> 在英国峰区国家公园那片广阔的土地上，坐落着金德·斯科特自然保护区，它是英国历史上一次重要的人民运动的发生地。金德·斯科特海拔约2087英尺，是峰区的最高点，崎岖的荒野和狂风呼啸的高原吸引着世世代代的冒险家和自然爱好者前来探险。1932年，这里发生了历史性的大规模非法闯入事件，数百名民众徒步抗议要求公众可以自由进入这片领域，这一公民抗命运动促使了英国国家公园立法的通过。峰区国家公园的建立使得这里的丘陵和山谷得到保护，成为生态资源，供后人享受，同时也标志着对大众通行权以及自然资源的保护工作取得了重大胜利。

<summary>Description</summary>

> Within the vast expanse of England's Peak District National Park lies Kinder Scout Nature Reserve, the site of an historic people's protest. At around 2,087 feet, Kinder Scout is the park's highest point and its rugged moorlands and windswept plateaus have drawn walkers and nature enthusiasts for generations. In 1932, it was the stage for a 'mass trespass,' in which hundreds of people on foot protested for public access to these lands. At the time, many areas of open countryside were closed to the British public. This act of civil disobedience prompted much public sympathy, which eventually led to the establishment of the UK's first national parks. The Peak District National Park was the first, designated in April 1951, ensuring that these hills and valleys would be preserved for future generations to enjoy.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Fancy witnessing a fiery waterfall? The seemingly impossible can be found at this time of year on the eastern side of El Capitan, Yosemite National Park's famous rock face. Horsetail Fall is a seasonal waterfall that flows only when there has been plenty of snowfall, and when temperatures have been warm enough to melt it. For a couple of weeks in February, if skies are clear, water is flowing, and the sun shines at just the right angle, the long, slender waterfall takes on a glowing, flame-hued appearance. Hundreds gather in Yosemite Valley to see this mesmerizing natural spectacle. The phenomenon has earned the moniker 'firefall,' an homage to the historic Yosemite Firefall, a manmade event from the top of the park's Glacier Point that took place between 1872 to 1968. Eventually, park rangers decided that dumping embers over a cliff onto the land below wasn't the brightest idea.

> The 'bathing boxes' on Brighton Beach, Melbourne, beam with a rainbow of colors against golden sands, the ocean, and the city skyline. A popular tourist attraction, they first popped up on Brighton's coastline in 1860, providing somewhere for swimmers to change into their bathing suits. They have been moved, repaired, and added to since then, and while they each have their own distinctive coat of paint, the bathing boxes are built in the same traditional style. Despite facing the threat of removal over the years, these vibrant coast guards remain, adding a splash of color to the beach, and providing their owners with somewhere to sit and enjoy the view.
