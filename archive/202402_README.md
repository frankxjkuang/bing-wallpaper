<summary>Description</summary>

> Born in New Orleans around the turn of the 20th century, with a sound that came from the blues, ragtime, and call-and-response vocals, jazz music is a notable chapter in Black history. You can almost hear John 'Dizzy' Gillespie playing his signature bent trumpet, featured on our homepage today. Gillespie made his name in bebop, often called the first modern form of jazz, playing alongside other greats including Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, and Thelonious Monk. Black musicians created genres like rock and roll, funk, hip-hop, and soul, the soundtrack to American culture and Black history.

> How long will winter last? Much depends on whether a certain groundhog sees his shadow today in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. On February 2, Punxsutawney Phil emerges from his tree stump, helped by members of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club's 'inner circle.' According to local legend, the same stocky groundhog has been predicting the weather since at least 1886 and if he sees his shadow, we can expect six more weeks of winter. If he does not, an early spring awaits.
> 
> Phil is said to make his prediction by choosing one of two scrolls, which top-hatted men then read out to the crowd, who cheer Phil on either way. Our homepage star today is a relative of Phil's, an alpine marmot, which has its own winter tradition of stocking up on food to prepare for a long hibernation. Let's hope that Phil doesn't see his shadow so we can exit our own.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Don your tricorn hat and gilded disguise, it's time to visit the Carnival of Venice. This centuries-old festival combines revelry with anonymity, thanks to the masks traditionally worn by attendees, from the classic square-jawed Bauta mask to the Colombina eye mask, with roots in Italian theater. Costumed rowers take part in a parade of traditional boats on Venice's famous Grand Canal while thousands of people wearing elaborate costumes enjoy the carnival atmosphere. Parades, parties, concerts, and performances will fill the streets until festivities end on Shrove Tuesday, which falls on February 13 this year. Visitors might pass by the Santa Maria della Salute, seen toward the back of today's image, a baroque basilica dedicated to the Virgin Mary, who is considered to be the protector of the city.

> Step through time and into the cavernous depths of Devetashka Cave in Bulgaria, a sprawling prehistoric complex which humans called home for tens of thousands of years. These days, it is home to bats, about 30,000 of them, as well as rare birds and reptiles. This karst cave was formed by erosion and is now part of a public park. Humans are thought to have sought shelter here as far back as the Early Stone Age, about 70,000 years ago, and many Neolithic artefacts from 6000-4000 BCE have been discovered. Several large openings in the cave cast natural light into the chambers, offering better illumination for photographers and nature lovers alike.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Western Monarch Day celebrates a stunning natural phenomenon, the annual migration of thousands of flame-colored butterflies to California. Traveling south to escape the winter weather, they use air currents to help them make journeys of hundreds of miles. They descend to gather in large numbers on eucalyptus trees, like the ones pictured on our homepage today in Goleta, Santa Barbara County. Those gathered to see clusters of butterflies in 100-foot-tall trees might confuse them for clumps of leaves at first. However, as the sun's rays gently fall upon them, their wings will begin to flutter. Bring your binoculars and take the opportunity to witness these winged wonders huddled together. It's truly a sight to behold!

> This serene scene shows Lake Tahoe, the largest alpine lake in North America and the second-deepest lake in the US. Peeking out of those misty waters is Bonsai Rock, the unlikely home of four small trees that have taken root in its cracks. Its name was inspired by the Japanese art of growing miniature trees, which are kept in small containers and pruned to control their size. The trees on Bonsai Rock are naturally restricted by the lack of space and nutrients, so no pruning is required. Part of the purpose of bonsai is to provide an opportunity for contemplation, and this tranquil spot high in the Sierra Nevada is the perfect place to relax and explore your thoughts. It is also popular with photographers, especially at sunset.

> St. James Beach is a small, sheltered beach on Cape Town's coastline, where vibrant Victorian bathing boxes sit side by side against an azure ocean backdrop. However, it's the St. James Tidal Pool, pictured on our homepage, that steals the spotlight. This protected bathing area, built between rugged rocks, offers crystal-clear waters for a tranquil swimming experience. The pool is warm compared with the ocean, teems with small marine life, and is perfect for floating around without worrying about strong currents. For those who like to stay dry, the beach is perfect for leisurely strolls, soaking up the sun, and observing the rhythmic ebb and flow of the tides.

> Mount Hood graces Oregon's skyline with a pointed, snow-capped peak. At nearly 11,250 feet high, this dormant stratovolcano is the tallest mountain in the state, drawing adventurers and nature aficionados alike. With 12 named glaciers and numerous snow fields, Mount Hood offers a wintry playground all year round. It also nurtures ancient forests and provides a haven for wildlife, including cougars and wolves. Over the past 1,800 years, the volcano has erupted three times. While considered dormant, there is still a chance that it could erupt one day.

This remote beach boasts turquoise waters, but it is the striking rocks that steal the show, standing tall against the might of the Indian Ocean. The rock formations, some of which are 33 feet tall, have given rise to various nicknames, among them Gigi Hiu (shark teeth) and Batu Layar (rock screen) Beach. While this beach has no tourist accommodation, the nearby village of Kiluan presents a haven for visitors. For those ready to trade lounging for exploring, this Sumatran treasure awaits.

> Celebrating the first new moon of the lunar calendar, an estimated 2 billion people gather worldwide to usher in the Lunar New Year with vibrant celebrations and family reunions. The festivities, also known as the Spring Festival or Chinese New Year, last for 15 days, ending with the Lantern Festival. From envelopes to lanterns, red is the dominant color, symbolizing luck and prosperity. Streets come alive with the rhythm of drums as the dragon dance takes center stage. Our homepage today shows a bird's-eye view of the dragons—elongated puppets with shimmering scales, animated by a team of dancers. Lunar New Year is a popular time for families to reunite and is said to be responsible for the world's largest annual human migration. Each year is linked to one of the 12 zodiac animals and 2024 heralds the Year of the Dragon, a symbol of nobility, power, and success.

> Welcome to Folegandros, one of the Greek Cyclades Islands in the Aegean Sea. This picturesque island has changed hands several times during its long history. It is thought it was once home to the Dorians, one of the four major ethnic groups of classical Greece, but it was also ruled for centuries by the Republic of Venice and later the Ottoman Empire. Greece reclaimed it in 1828.

> Chora, the island's modern capital, can be seen on our homepage, perched on the edge of a 656-foot cliff with sweeping views of the ocean and surrounding islands. Built by the Venetians in 1212, the town is now a popular tourist destination, with its charming squares and traditional whitewashed churches.
