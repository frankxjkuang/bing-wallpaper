> 蜿蜒起伏的砂岩脊绵延于犹他州凯恩维尔荒地，宛如大自然在石头上绘制的笔触。这些地貌由细粒沉积物构成，最初沉积在古代河流三角洲和内陆海洋中，随后逐渐硬化为岩石。随着时间的推移，侵蚀作用穿透了这些地层，露出流动般的波纹状图案。沉积岩层记录着气候变迁和古老地貌的演变。今日图片中，这片荒凉的土地看似毫无生机，但在早春时节，降雨会让大地铺满紫色和黄色的小花。一天的不同时刻，光影不断变化，展现出不同的角度与风貌，为摄影师和游客提供了丰富的观赏体验。尽管这片崎岖不平的地形大部分仍然保持原始状态，但部分区域地势较为平缓，允许游客在无需剧烈攀爬的情况下轻松探索。
> 
> 荒地广布于除南极洲以外的所有大陆。早期探险者在穿越这些艰难地形时遭遇重重困难，因此赋予它们“荒地”之名。古生物学家经常能在这里发现史前生物的化石遗骸。尽管环境极端，这些土地依然孕育着丰富的生命，包括沙漠植物、蜥蜴和鸟类。

<summary>Description</summary>

> Wavy sandstone ridges stretch across the Caineville Badlands, Utah, resembling nature's brushstrokes on stone. These formations are made of fine-grained sediment that settled in ancient river deltas and inland seas and later hardened into stone. Over time, erosion carved through the layers, exposing flowing, ripple-like patterns. The sedimentary layers tell a story of shifting climates and ancient landscapes. The barren land, seen in today's image, may appear lifeless, but during early spring, rainfall blankets the terrain with tiny purple and yellow flowers. Light and shadow shift throughout the day, offering photographers and visitors various angles. While much of the terrain remains rugged, some areas offer easy access, allowing visitors to explore without strenuous hiking.
> 
> Badlands exist on every continent except Antarctica. Early explorers named them after struggling to navigate harsh terrains. Fossil hunters frequently uncover remnants of prehistoric creatures in the eroded hills. Despite the extreme conditions, these lands support a wide range of life, including desert plants, lizards, and birds.

> Have you ever spotted a rainbow and felt a little lucky? National Find a Rainbow Day, celebrated today, is all about looking to the sky for that magical mix of sun and rain. Nature's color wheel has long been linked to myths and legends, from Norse gods to the Irish leprechaun's pot of gold. But beyond folklore, the science behind rainbows is just as compelling. The first real explanation came from Theodoric of Freiberg, a German physicist, in 1304. He discovered that rainbows form when sunlight enters a raindrop, bends, reflects inside, and then bends again as it exits. This process splits light into its colors, creating the spectrum we see. The classic 'ROYGBIV' (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet) doesn't tell the whole story—rainbows contain millions of colors blended together.

> Not all rainbows look the same. Double rainbows occur when a fainter, reversed arc appears above the main one. Moonbows happen at night when moonlight refracts through water droplets. The rare supernumerary rainbow features extra pastel bands inside the primary arc. Today's image features a rainbow over Wasson Peak in Saguaro National Park, Arizona. Against a backdrop of desert cacti and rocky slopes, the vibrant arc stands out in a place where rain is scarce, proving that even the driest landscapes can surprise you.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Every spring, Washington, DC, transforms into a sea of pink and white as the cherry trees bloom, marking the return of the National Cherry Blossom Festival. This beloved event commemorates the 1912 gift of 3,000 cherry trees from Tokyo's Mayor Yukio Ozaki to the US, symbolizing the friendship between the two nations.
> 
> This year's festival runs through April 13, with the peak bloom period expected to last four to seven days, depending on the weather. The Tidal Basin is the most popular spot for viewing, offering breathtaking scenes near landmarks like the Jefferson Memorial and the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial. If you prefer a quieter experience, check out Dumbarton Oaks or the National Arboretum for off-the-beaten-path beauty. Will you be visiting this year? If so, we recommend you arrive early in the morning or in the evening for the best views and fewer crowds. And remember—look, but don't touch! Picking the blossoms is against the law and harms the trees.
