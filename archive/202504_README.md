> 蜿蜒起伏的砂岩脊绵延于犹他州凯恩维尔荒地，宛如大自然在石头上绘制的笔触。这些地貌由细粒沉积物构成，最初沉积在古代河流三角洲和内陆海洋中，随后逐渐硬化为岩石。随着时间的推移，侵蚀作用穿透了这些地层，露出流动般的波纹状图案。沉积岩层记录着气候变迁和古老地貌的演变。今日图片中，这片荒凉的土地看似毫无生机，但在早春时节，降雨会让大地铺满紫色和黄色的小花。一天的不同时刻，光影不断变化，展现出不同的角度与风貌，为摄影师和游客提供了丰富的观赏体验。尽管这片崎岖不平的地形大部分仍然保持原始状态，但部分区域地势较为平缓，允许游客在无需剧烈攀爬的情况下轻松探索。
> 
> 荒地广布于除南极洲以外的所有大陆。早期探险者在穿越这些艰难地形时遭遇重重困难，因此赋予它们“荒地”之名。古生物学家经常能在这里发现史前生物的化石遗骸。尽管环境极端，这些土地依然孕育着丰富的生命，包括沙漠植物、蜥蜴和鸟类。

<summary>Description</summary>

> Wavy sandstone ridges stretch across the Caineville Badlands, Utah, resembling nature's brushstrokes on stone. These formations are made of fine-grained sediment that settled in ancient river deltas and inland seas and later hardened into stone. Over time, erosion carved through the layers, exposing flowing, ripple-like patterns. The sedimentary layers tell a story of shifting climates and ancient landscapes. The barren land, seen in today's image, may appear lifeless, but during early spring, rainfall blankets the terrain with tiny purple and yellow flowers. Light and shadow shift throughout the day, offering photographers and visitors various angles. While much of the terrain remains rugged, some areas offer easy access, allowing visitors to explore without strenuous hiking.
> 
> Badlands exist on every continent except Antarctica. Early explorers named them after struggling to navigate harsh terrains. Fossil hunters frequently uncover remnants of prehistoric creatures in the eroded hills. Despite the extreme conditions, these lands support a wide range of life, including desert plants, lizards, and birds.

> Have you ever spotted a rainbow and felt a little lucky? National Find a Rainbow Day, celebrated today, is all about looking to the sky for that magical mix of sun and rain. Nature's color wheel has long been linked to myths and legends, from Norse gods to the Irish leprechaun's pot of gold. But beyond folklore, the science behind rainbows is just as compelling. The first real explanation came from Theodoric of Freiberg, a German physicist, in 1304. He discovered that rainbows form when sunlight enters a raindrop, bends, reflects inside, and then bends again as it exits. This process splits light into its colors, creating the spectrum we see. The classic 'ROYGBIV' (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet) doesn't tell the whole story—rainbows contain millions of colors blended together.
> 
> Not all rainbows look the same. Double rainbows occur when a fainter, reversed arc appears above the main one. Moonbows happen at night when moonlight refracts through water droplets. The rare supernumerary rainbow features extra pastel bands inside the primary arc. Today's image features a rainbow over Wasson Peak in Saguaro National Park, Arizona. Against a backdrop of desert cacti and rocky slopes, the vibrant arc stands out in a place where rain is scarce, proving that even the driest landscapes can surprise you.

> Every spring, Washington, DC, transforms into a sea of pink and white as the cherry trees bloom, marking the return of the National Cherry Blossom Festival. This beloved event commemorates the 1912 gift of 3,000 cherry trees from Tokyo's Mayor Yukio Ozaki to the US, symbolizing the friendship between the two nations.
> 
> This year's festival runs through April 13, with the peak bloom period expected to last four to seven days, depending on the weather. The Tidal Basin is the most popular spot for viewing, offering breathtaking scenes near landmarks like the Jefferson Memorial and the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial. If you prefer a quieter experience, check out Dumbarton Oaks or the National Arboretum for off-the-beaten-path beauty. Will you be visiting this year? If so, we recommend you arrive early in the morning or in the evening for the best views and fewer crowds. And remember—look, but don't touch! Picking the blossoms is against the law and harms the trees.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Libraries are magical places. They are home to books full of stories and knowledge, provide easy access to resources that might not be affordable for all, and offer spaces for book clubs, author talks, and other social gatherings. Without a doubt, our society benefits from libraries in several ways. To motivate people to read and take advantage of these institutions, the National Book Committee initiated an event series. The first National Library Week was celebrated in 1958 with the action slogan, 'Wake Up and Read!' This year, the annual National Library Week starts on April 6, which coincides with National Library Day. Some libraries will amaze us not only with their collection of books but also with their architecture. The George Peabody Library at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore has earned the prestigious nickname, 'the cathedral of books.' Take today's image as inspiration for the theme of the 2025 National Library Week: 'Drawn to the Library.'

> Today, we celebrate International Beaver Day! Established in 2009 by Beavers Wetlands & Wildlife, this day highlights the vital role beavers play in our ecosystems. Beavers are remarkable creatures known for their dam-building skills, which create wetlands, benefiting numerous species. As North America's largest rodents, they can grow up to 3 feet long, not including their distinctive flat tails. Their continuously growing teeth, with thick enamel giving them an orange hue, are essential tools for gnawing on trees—a behavior that maintains both their dental health and their environment. No wonder their strong choppers make them one of nature's best engineers. Who knew a furry little architect could have such a big impact on nature?

> Tucked along the Algarve coast in Portugal is the Benagil Cave, carved by the relentless power of the sea. Called Algar de Benagil in Portuguese, this sea cave, seen in today's image, draws adventurers, photographers, and nature enthusiasts from across the world. With its limestone walls, circular skylight, and turquoise waters, its interior looks like a natural cathedral.
> 
> Benagil Cave wasn't sculpted overnight—it was formed over millions of years by coastal erosion, shaped mostly by waves, currents, and tides. The cave's most distinctive feature is its 'eye,' a natural opening in the ceiling that bathes the interior in sunlight, creating a stunning interplay of light and shadow. The cave is located near Benagil, a village on the Atlantic coast in the municipality of Lagoa. Until the late 20th century, Benagil was a traditional fishing village, with its economy deeply rooted in ocean fishing. Over the years, it has transformed into a thriving tourist destination, thanks in part to its beach, Praia de Benagil. The region, including the Benagil Cave, showcases a perfect harmony of nature's wonders and the charms of Portugal's coastline.

> From the famous tulip fields to the world's largest flower auction, the Netherlands and tulips go a long way back. Tulips didn't originate here. These beauties arrived in the country in the late 16th century, brought from the Ottoman Empire. By the 17th century, they became so valuable that a single bulb could cost more than a house. This period, known as 'tulip mania,' is considered one of the first recorded financial bubbles. When prices crashed in 1637, fortunes were lost, but the love for tulips remained.
> 
> The most famous tulip fields, like the ones pictured here, are found in regions such as the Bollenstreek (Bulb Region), just outside Amsterdam. Rows of red, yellow, pink, and purple stretch as far as the eye can see. Then there's Keukenhof, in Lisse, the world's most famous flower park, open only for a few weeks each spring. It showcases over 7 million flowering bulbs, including rare and exotic tulip varieties. The designs change every year, so no two visits are ever the same. If you miss the bloom, don't worry—the Netherlands keeps its tulip industry thriving year-round. The Dutch take their tulips seriously, and nowhere is this more evident than at the Aalsmeer Flower Auction, the largest flower market in the world. Here, millions of flowers, including tulips, are bought and sold daily, making their way to homes across the globe.

> Not so long ago, humanity took its first step beyond Earth. For thousands of years, we gazed at the stars, dreaming of what lay beyond. Then, on April 12, 1961, one man left the planet and changed history forever. That morning, Soviet pilot Yuri Gagarin climbed into a small, spherical spacecraft named Vostok 1. The countdown began. The engines ignited. As the rocket roared toward the sky, he called out, 'Poyekhali!'—'Let's go!' And just like that, Earth had its first space traveler.
> 
> For 108 minutes, Gagarin orbited the planet, watching the world from a view no human had ever seen before. When he landed safely back on Earth, everything had changed. Humanity had entered the Space Age. His flight sparked the race to the Moon, the dream of living on Mars, and much more. Decades later, in honor of his achievement, the United Nations declared April 12 as the International Day of Human Space Flight. Pictured here is the view from the cupola of the International Space Station, showing the vast South Pacific Ocean. It is a reminder of how small Earth is in the grand cosmos—and how far human spaceflight has taken us.

> New Year celebrations don't always come with fireworks—sometimes, they come with buckets and a nationwide water splash fest! Thailand's Songkran festival is a unique mix of spiritual traditions and all-out water fights. Held from April 13 to 15 this year, the holiday is deeply rooted in Buddhist customs and focuses on cleansing and starting afresh. During this time, people visit temples, offer food to monks, and pour scented water over Buddha statues and elders' hands as a sign of respect. Meanwhile, the streets turn into water battlegrounds, with locals and tourists alike getting soaked in the spirit of renewal. Traditional parades roll through the lanes, and in some places, the 'Lady Songkran' or 'Miss Songkran' contest steals the show, with contestants dressed in stunning Thai outfits.

> Those seeking a calmer way to celebrate might consider visiting Wat Tang Sai Temple in the village of Ban Krut, seen in today's image. Perched on Thong Chai Mountain, this temple complex is home to a 43-foot-tall Buddha statue and Thai-style pagodas. Built in 1996 to honor King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) on his 50th year of reign, it remains an important spiritual site. With stunning coastline views, Wat Tang Sai offers a peaceful setting to meditate and feel the vibrations of Buddhist chants.

> Dolphins don't need a calendar to celebrate—but we do! National Dolphin Day, on April 14, reminds us to appreciate these smart and downright fascinating marine mammals. From leaping through waves to chatting in clicks and whistles, dolphins are all about social life. They often travel in pods and love to check out passing boats whenever they get the chance. But pollution and overfishing threaten their survival, and they need our help. National Dolphin Day is a chance to learn, take action, and—if you're lucky—see these creatures in their natural habitat.
> 
> Take the Atlantic spotted dolphin—the star of today's image—known for the spots on its body, which multiply and become denser with age. You'll find them in the warm temperate and tropical waters of the Atlantic, hunting fish in coordinated groups. Their speed and agility make them efficient hunters—and a thrill to watch. The United States is home to several species, including the bottlenose, common, Risso's, and spinner dolphins. Each species helps maintain the ocean's balance, highlighting the need to conserve their habitat.

<summary>Description</summary>

> What if we celebrated World Art Day with our feet in the sand? Created by the International Association of Art in honor of Leonardo da Vinci's birthday, this day promotes creativity in all its forms. This is exactly what artist Zarpõ did on the beach at Sauveterre, in Vendée, France. He sculpted a gigantic work, playing with natural curves and patterns to create an unforgettable spectacle.
> 
> Zarpõ, aka 'Le Jardinier de la Plage,' creates his art with just the wind, the sand, and a huge dose of talent. Here, each line drawn tells a story, each motif interacts with the environment. But this art has one golden rule: It is ephemeral. In a few hours, the tide will have erased everything.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Within the remote canyons of southeastern Utah, Natural Bridges National Monument highlights the power of erosion and the passage of time. Shaped by the relentless forces of wind and water, this monument features three magnificent natural bridges—Sipapu, Kachina, and Owachomo. These bridges were named to honor the Ancestral Puebloans who once lived here. Sipapu is the largest bridge, with a massive opening that could almost fit the dome of the United States Capitol. Kachina, pictured here, is equidistant from Sipapu and Owachomo. It was named after the petroglyphs and pictographs found at its base. Owachomo is believed to be the oldest of the three. Its thin, arching structure suggests it may eventually collapse.
> 
> Recognizing the significance of these natural wonders, President Theodore Roosevelt designated Natural Bridges as Utah's first national monument on this day in 1908. Today, it remains a place of awe and solitude, where visitors can hike beneath the soaring bridges, gaze at some of the darkest night skies in the country, and step back into a landscape sculpted over millions of years.

<summary>Description</summary>

> If fashion had a bird ambassador, the cock-of-the-rock would steal the spotlight. The males look like they're wearing a bright orange-red costume, complete with a huge crest that almost covers their beak. With its bold colors, this native South American bird isn't just about looks—it's got the moves too. The Andean and Guianan cock-of-the-rock are renowned for their theatrical courtship dances, making them true head-turners of the feathered kingdom. Females are far less flashy, with brownish feathers that help them stay hidden. During the mating season, males gather in leks—noisy display arenas—where they hop, squawk, and shake their heads in an effort to impress a female. She watches, picks the best dancer, mates, and then flies off to build a concave, cup-shaped mud nest on a rocky surface.
> 
> The female typically lays two white eggs and incubates them for 25 to 28 days, raising the chicks on her own. The Andean cock-of-the-rock thrives in the cloud forests of the Andes, favoring dense, fruit-rich areas in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. As a frugivore, it primarily eats fruit and helps spread seeds throughout its habitat. It occasionally consumes insects and small vertebrates.

> A remarkable example is Göreme Historical National Park in Cappadocia, Türkiye. It's famous for its 'fairy chimneys'—towering rock formations shaped by volcanic ash and erosion over thousands of years. People carved homes, churches, and entire underground cities into these soft rock formations, some dating back to the 4th century. Today, it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting visitors from around the world. Whether it's ancient castles, temples, or hidden underground cities, this day reminds us to appreciate and protect the landmarks that tell the story of humanity.

> Today is a special day for billions of Christians worldwide—a time of renewal, celebration, and traditions. Easter, also called Pascha or Resurrection Sunday, commemorates the resurrection of Jesus Christ as described in the New Testament. It's also a time for festive traditions, from sunrise services to Easter egg hunts and, of course, the beloved Easter Bunny.

> The origins of the Easter Bunny are unclear, but historians believe German settlers introduced the tradition to America in the 1700s. In German folklore, an egg-laying hare called 'Osterhase' visited children and left behind decorated eggs representing good fortune and new beginnings. Over time, this tradition evolved into Easter baskets filled with chocolates, jellybeans, and marshmallows. Whether you're enjoying a festive feast, decorating eggs, or simply soaking in the beauty of spring, may your Easter be filled with joy and love!

> Imagine standing under a sky so dark that the Milky Way stretches across it like a luminous ribbon. This is the experience that International Dark Sky Week aims to bring back. Every April, during the week of the new moon (this year from April 21 to 27), we are invited to turn off our lights and gaze at the stars. The event was initiated by Jennifer Barlow, a high school student in 2003, to combat light pollution. One of the best places to experience the night sky's beauty is Joshua Tree National Park in southeastern California, an International Dark Sky Park. Here, the absence of artificial light allows visitors to see the stars as our ancestors once did. Did you know that light pollution prevents us from seeing most of the stars in the Milky Way? By reducing it, we can reconnect with the universe's beauty and wonder.

> On Earth Day, let's journey to one of nature's most stunning displays of geothermal power—Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. The largest hot spring in the US, it spans 370 feet across and reaches temperatures of 160°F. This geothermal marvel is fueled by the immense heat of the massive Yellowstone volcano beneath the surface. Its vivid rings of blue, green, yellow, and orange are created by heat-loving microorganisms—called thermophiles—that thrive in the mineral-rich waters.
> 
> Yellowstone's geothermal activity not only fuels its geysers and hot springs, but also demonstrates a model for sustainable energy. Unlike fossil fuels, geothermal energy provides a continuous and renewable energy source. As we celebrate Earth Day, the theme 'Our Power, Our Planet' highlights the need for cleaner energy solutions. Yellowstone National Park's geothermal forces showcase Earth's untapped potential—one that could help reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change. The Grand Prismatic Spring serves as a reminder that our planet holds immense power. The challenge is using it wisely for a sustainable future.

> 'All the world's a stage ...' and only a few have shaped that stage like William Shakespeare. Every April 23, we celebrate Shakespeare Day, honoring one of England's greatest playwrights and poets. This date is special as it marks both his birth and death. Born in 1564, Shakespeare revolutionized English literature with unforgettable works like 'Hamlet,' 'Macbeth,' and 'Romeo and Juliet.' Four centuries after his death, his influence remains undeniable—his stories continue to captivate, challenge, and inspire.

> With today's image, we can step inside Shakespeare's Globe in London, a faithful reconstruction of the original 1599 theater where the Bard's plays once thrilled Elizabethan audiences. The original Globe, built by Shakespeare's acting company, the Lord Chamberlain's Men, was destroyed by fire in 1613 when a cannon misfired during a performance of 'Henry VIII.' With an open-air stage, wooden benches, and a standing 'groundlings' area, the modern Globe is as close as one can get to experiencing Shakespeare's plays as his audience did.

> As National Park Week rolls on, let's turn our attention to Kenai Fjords National Park, a gem on Alaska's Kenai Peninsula. Stretching over 1,000 square miles, this landscape features fjords, river valleys, and alpine landscapes. More than half of the terrain is blanketed in ice. Throughout the 20th century, the park's glaciers have receded, uncovering new land for plant and animal life to take root. From ancient Sitka spruces to delicate fireweed shoots and moss carpeting the forest floor, plant life in Kenai Fjords flourishes. The park is also home to diverse terrestrial and marine mammals, including timber wolves, porcupines, Canadian lynxes, and cetaceans like orcas and fin whales. It also hosts a variety of birds, such as bald eagles and Peale's peregrine falcons.

> Kenai Fjords isn't just about stunning landscapes and flourishing wilderness—it's also a place rich with human history. For thousands of years, Alaska Natives have called this region home, leaving behind traces of their lives in the land. Within the national park, the past still lingers—from the camps left by Alaska Native Sugpiaq people once scattered along the coastline to the remnants of old mining camps in Nuka Bay.

> Cute, clumsy, and completely captivating, penguins steal the show today. World Penguin Day is all about celebrating these flightless birds while raising awareness about their habitats. This day originated at McMurdo Station, an American research center on Ross Island in Antarctica, where scientists observed Adélie penguins starting their yearly migration around this time. Inspired by this natural event, the observance was created to shed light on penguins' role in the ecosystem, the threats they face, and the urgency of protecting their habitats.
> 
> Among the many remarkable species of penguins are Magellanic penguins, featured in today's image. A species native to South America's coastal regions, these birds breed along Patagonia's shores in Argentina, Chile, and the Falkland Islands. Named after Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, these medium-sized penguins were first documented in 1520. They can grow up to 30 inches tall and weigh around 15 pounds. Skilled hunters, they thrive on a diet of small fish, squid, and krill, efficiently filtering seawater with their specialized salt-excreting glands. With the abundant marine life along South America's Atlantic coast, they have a reliable food source. While these flightless creatures may not soar in the skies, they certainly capture hearts.

The combined RNSP contain Redwood National Park, Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park, Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, and Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park. Some of these redwoods were alive when the Mayans built their temples, and the Great Wall of China was under construction. Protected since 1968, the park preserves nearly half of the world's remaining old-growth redwoods.

You can also hike the Tall Trees Trail, a permit-only path where you can closely witness the tallest trees. The RNSP ecosystem is home to many animals, including Roosevelt elk, black bears, banana slugs, and the endangered marbled murrelets. Ferns and moss thrive beneath the leafy canopy, while coastal fog provides essential moisture to the trees. Whether hiking beneath these towering giants or simply standing in their shadows, the experience is humbling.

The Halema'uma'u Crater is an intermittent lava lake in Kīlauea, one of Earth's most active volcanoes. Since it was first documented in 1823, volcanic activity has caused the crater to fill with lava, partially collapse, erupt in fountains of lava, expand to twice its size on two occasions, and at times fill with groundwater. All this activity demonstrates the unpredictable raw power that lies below the surface of the Earth. The natural and cultural importance of this site led to the establishment of Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park in 1916, and to it being named a UNESCO International Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site in the 1980s.

> Here's a place where the wild rules and nature moves at its own pace. Moremi Game Reserve stretches across the eastern side of Botswana's Okavango Delta, covering 1,900 square miles. Established in 1963, it became Africa's first reserve created by local people—the Batawana, a Bantu ethnic group native to Southern Africa—to protect the region's wildlife from uncontrolled hunting. The combination of permanent water and dry land makes it one of the best places in Africa to observe wildlife in its natural habitat.
> 
> One animal you're almost certain to spot is the impala. These medium-sized antelopes are active mainly during the day. Males fight fiercely for dominance during the breeding season, or rut, locking horns in dramatic battles. After a six-month gestation period, females give birth to a single fawn. Outside the mating season, they stick together in herds—the territorial males, bachelor herds, and female herds—always on the lookout for predators. When danger strikes, they freeze, only to explode into a sprint when the moment demands. They can leap up to 10 feet high, cover nearly 30 feet in a single bound, and change direction mid-sprint. Whether grazing quietly or launching into a sudden dash, impalas are among Moremi's most adaptable residents.

> The grass truly is greener on the other side—especially when that side is Château de Villandry. While the Loire Valley in France is packed with stunning châteaux (French for castles), Villandry stands apart, not for its towering turrets or medieval might, but for its gardens. Built in the 16th century by Jean le Breton, a minister to King Francis I, Villandry was always meant to impress. Unlike fortified castles built for war, it was designed for comfort, featuring large windows and an open, welcoming layout. Its gardens are arranged across terraces with distinct themes. The ornamental garden showcases geometric patterns like the one pictured here. The water garden offers a serene retreat, and the vegetable garden turns everyday crops into artistic displays.
> 
> After a challenging period, the dilapidated Château de Villandry was purchased in 1906 by Spanish doctor Joachim Carvallo and his wife, Ann Coleman, an heiress to an American steel empire. Their passion for history and horticulture led to a full restoration, and their descendants continue to maintain the estate today. These gardens change with the seasons, ensuring that no two visits are exactly alike. Whether you have a green thumb or not, it's hard not to admire the precision at play.

> It's time to jazz up—literally. From the smoky clubs of New Orleans to the bustling streets of Tokyo, jazz has crossed borders, blended cultures, and turned improvisation into an art form. Every April 30, International Jazz Day—established by UNESCO in 2011—celebrates this genre's role in promoting peace, dialogue, and unity. This music form emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in New Orleans, a city alive with musical traditions from Africa, Europe, and the Caribbean. Rooted in blues and ragtime, jazz quickly evolved, with pioneers like Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald giving it a voice. What started as an American sound soon found a global audience. Swing and bebop took over dance halls, Latin jazz brought a new rhythm, and cool jazz mellowed the mood.
> 
> Today, jazz is everywhere—from Brazilian bossa nova to Ethiopian Ethio-jazz, proving that a good groove knows no borders. This photo of jazz legend John Coltrane and his band performing in London, England, is a perfect example of jazz's worldwide impact. Trends change, technology evolves, and debates continue over what defines jazz, but this music lives on. So, today, tune in, tap your feet, and let the rhythm take over—because this celebration has truly struck the right chord.
