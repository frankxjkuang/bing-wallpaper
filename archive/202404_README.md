> Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, well, it must be April Fools' Day! Although no one is quite sure of the origins of this day, it has been celebrated for centuries in many different countries. Humor really does transcend borders! Over the years, there have been some truly memorable April Fools' Day jokes: in 1957, a BBC program convinced its viewers that spaghetti was harvested from trees, while in 1985, Sports Illustrated readers were amazed to read about a pitcher who could throw a ball at 168 miles per hour.

> 正如青蛙科米特（《布偶电影》中的主角）曾在歌曲《彩虹般的连接》中所唱的那样：“彩虹是幻象，但只是幻象，彩虹没有什么可以隐藏的……”每年4月3日是美国的 “全国寻找彩虹日”，这一天旨在庆祝这一多彩的自然现象，它让世界各地的人们都欣喜不已。当阳光通过大气中的雨滴，光线被反射和散射时，彩虹就会出现。在“寻找彩虹日”这天，人们会参加相关的活动，例如在雨后寻找彩虹或者是创作以彩虹为主题的艺术。在今天的图片中，我们看到一道彩虹挂在吉尔吉斯斯坦雄伟的Kakshaal Too 山脉上，崎岖的山峰和纯净原始的山谷构成了一副绝美的背景图，与稍纵即逝的彩虹美景相得益彰。

> As Kermit the Frog once sang, 'Rainbows are visions, but only illusions, and rainbows have nothing to hide.' Every year on April 3, National Find a Rainbow Day celebrates this colorful natural phenomenon that delights people all around the world. Rainbows occur when sunlight reflects and disperses through raindrops in the atmosphere. On Find a Rainbow Day, people take part in activities like searching for rainbows after rainfall or creating rainbow-themed art. In today's image, we see a rainbow splashed across the majestic Kakshaal Too Mountains in Kyrgyzstan. The Kakshaal Too range, with its rugged peaks and pristine valleys, is a fitting backdrop for the fleeting beauty of rainbows.

> From Strawberry Day to Cat Day and even Vegetable Day, Japan has a list of faux holidays, which are the clever results of 'dajare' or word plays. Today's date, April 6, makes up the Japanese word for castle, 'shiro' from 'shi' (4) and 'ro' (6). Hence, the celebration of castles. What better opportunity than Castle Day, to learn about the country's largest and most-visited castle, Himeji Castle? Dating back to 1333, this UNESCO World Heritage Site boasts an advanced defensive design and five National Treasure structures. The castle has also withstood time and nature's fury, surviving the bombings of World War II and the Great Hanshin earthquake in 1995. Nearly 700 years of glory, local legends, and ghost stories reverberate through the 83 rooms of this hilltop fortress. Would you care to explore?

> Known as nature's engineers, beavers have been shaping the world for millions of years. Historically, North American beavers faced challenges from humans. They were hunted for their fur, and their 'nuisance' freshwater abodes were destroyed. However, these buck-toothed, paddle-tailed dam builders have been gaining new respect in recent years. These animals have beneficial effects not only on water quality but also on land. With their iron-coated orange incisors, beavers fell trees, diligently constructing not just homes but habitats. Their dams create life-sustaining wetlands for countless species. Meanwhile, their lodges are masterpieces of security and comfort, the entrance strategically submerged to deter predators and provide privacy. The rodents have no trouble getting in, as they can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes. So, 'woodn't' it be nice to give a shout-out to these creatures on International Beaver Day?

<summary>Description</summary>

> Put on your solar glasses and turn your eyes skyward. Today, you can witness a rare celestial event—a total solar eclipse! As the moon perfectly aligns between the Earth and the sun, daylight will shift eerily to twilight. The total solar eclipse will be visible across North America, from Mazatlán, Mexico, to eastern Canada's Newfoundland Island, for up to four and a half minutes between 10:57 AM PST and 4:47 PM ADT. It will be the first total solar eclipse visible in the continental United States since August 21, 2017, although one occurs somewhere on Earth approximately every 18 months. Astronomers study the sun's corona, which is the outermost part of its atmosphere, its magnetic fields, and the behavior of Earth's atmosphere during the eclipse. Keep an eye on the time today and find a good spot to put on eclipse-safe solar glasses and see the golden ring emerge.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to nature's bowling alley. Bowling Ball Beach on the Mendocino Coast in California is named after the striking rock formations strewn across the shore. These sandstone balls—a phenomenon known as concretions—formed over millions of years as sedimentary layers built up around a central core of sand and stone held together by mineral cements. Erosion gradually wore away the outer layers to expose the spherical shapes we see today. This created a fascinating spectacle that only appears at low tide. Concretions are rare, and there has been plenty of wild speculation about where they come from, with some believing them to be extraterrestrial debris while others wondering if they are dinosaur fossils. The answer, however, is quite simple: it is the forces of nature at play.

In 1997, Union Square was recognized as a National Historic Landmark due to its importance in US labor history.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to the world, bear cub! After spending the first months of its life inside the den, this little American black bear may be puzzled by the outside world. The cubs are born between January and February and emerge from their dens in the spring, weighing around 5 pounds. By their first birthday, they can grow to about 80 pounds. However, their weight—which ranges between 100 and 600 pounds for adults—depends on their age, sex, the season, and food available in their area. Black bears are the only bears found in Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, which provides the setting for today's image.
