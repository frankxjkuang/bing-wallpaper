> Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, well, it must be April Fools' Day! Although no one is quite sure of the origins of this day, it has been celebrated for centuries in many different countries. Humor really does transcend borders! Over the years, there have been some truly memorable April Fools' Day jokes: in 1957, a BBC program convinced its viewers that spaghetti was harvested from trees, while in 1985, Sports Illustrated readers were amazed to read about a pitcher who could throw a ball at 168 miles per hour.

> As Kermit the Frog once sang, 'Rainbows are visions, but only illusions, and rainbows have nothing to hide.' Every year on April 3, National Find a Rainbow Day celebrates this colorful natural phenomenon that delights people all around the world. Rainbows occur when sunlight reflects and disperses through raindrops in the atmosphere. On Find a Rainbow Day, people take part in activities like searching for rainbows after rainfall or creating rainbow-themed art. In today's image, we see a rainbow splashed across the majestic Kakshaal Too Mountains in Kyrgyzstan. The Kakshaal Too range, with its rugged peaks and pristine valleys, is a fitting backdrop for the fleeting beauty of rainbows.

> From Strawberry Day to Cat Day and even Vegetable Day, Japan has a list of faux holidays, which are the clever results of 'dajare' or word plays. Today's date, April 6, makes up the Japanese word for castle, 'shiro' from 'shi' (4) and 'ro' (6). Hence, the celebration of castles. What better opportunity than Castle Day, to learn about the country's largest and most-visited castle, Himeji Castle? Dating back to 1333, this UNESCO World Heritage Site boasts an advanced defensive design and five National Treasure structures. The castle has also withstood time and nature's fury, surviving the bombings of World War II and the Great Hanshin earthquake in 1995. Nearly 700 years of glory, local legends, and ghost stories reverberate through the 83 rooms of this hilltop fortress. Would you care to explore?

> Known as nature's engineers, beavers have been shaping the world for millions of years. Historically, North American beavers faced challenges from humans. They were hunted for their fur, and their 'nuisance' freshwater abodes were destroyed. However, these buck-toothed, paddle-tailed dam builders have been gaining new respect in recent years. These animals have beneficial effects not only on water quality but also on land. With their iron-coated orange incisors, beavers fell trees, diligently constructing not just homes but habitats. Their dams create life-sustaining wetlands for countless species. Meanwhile, their lodges are masterpieces of security and comfort, the entrance strategically submerged to deter predators and provide privacy. The rodents have no trouble getting in, as they can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes. So, 'woodn't' it be nice to give a shout-out to these creatures on International Beaver Day?

<summary>Description</summary>

> Put on your solar glasses and turn your eyes skyward. Today, you can witness a rare celestial event—a total solar eclipse! As the moon perfectly aligns between the Earth and the sun, daylight will shift eerily to twilight. The total solar eclipse will be visible across North America, from Mazatlán, Mexico, to eastern Canada's Newfoundland Island, for up to four and a half minutes between 10:57 AM PST and 4:47 PM ADT. It will be the first total solar eclipse visible in the continental United States since August 21, 2017, although one occurs somewhere on Earth approximately every 18 months. Astronomers study the sun's corona, which is the outermost part of its atmosphere, its magnetic fields, and the behavior of Earth's atmosphere during the eclipse. Keep an eye on the time today and find a good spot to put on eclipse-safe solar glasses and see the golden ring emerge.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to nature's bowling alley. Bowling Ball Beach on the Mendocino Coast in California is named after the striking rock formations strewn across the shore. These sandstone balls—a phenomenon known as concretions—formed over millions of years as sedimentary layers built up around a central core of sand and stone held together by mineral cements. Erosion gradually wore away the outer layers to expose the spherical shapes we see today. This created a fascinating spectacle that only appears at low tide. Concretions are rare, and there has been plenty of wild speculation about where they come from, with some believing them to be extraterrestrial debris while others wondering if they are dinosaur fossils. The answer, however, is quite simple: it is the forces of nature at play.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to the world, bear cub! After spending the first months of its life inside the den, this little American black bear may be puzzled by the outside world. The cubs are born between January and February and emerge from their dens in the spring, weighing around 5 pounds. By their first birthday, they can grow to about 80 pounds. However, their weight—which ranges between 100 and 600 pounds for adults—depends on their age, sex, the season, and food available in their area. Black bears are the only bears found in Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, which provides the setting for today's image.

> Happy International Day for Monuments and Sites! Also called World Heritage Day, the event highlights efforts to conserve our cultural heritage. Some of the amazing heritage sites around the world include Machu Picchu in Peru and the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt. The stone structure in today's image is part of the medieval city walls of Ávila in Spain. Built between the 11th and 14th centuries to defend the city against attack, these fortifications stretch for 1.5 miles around Ávila. Nowadays, visitors can walk around sections of the walls, enjoying views of the city and the surrounding countryside.

<summary>Description</summary>

> At the heart of the Orkney Islands, an archipelago in northern Scotland, lies an ancient riddle: the Ring of Brodgar. Dating back to sometime between 2500 and 2000 BCE, this Neolithic henge—a type of ancient circular earthwork—and stone circle measure about 340 feet across. Lying on a narrow strip of land between two lochs, the site initially comprised 60 stones, although today only 36 remain. The exact purpose of the structure is still unknown, despite an excavation project at the site in 2008. In 1999, the Heart of Neolithic Orkney group of monuments, which includes the Ring of Brodgar, was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. If you are planning a trip to Scotland, consider walking amid the echoes of history at the Ring of Brodgar while the crisp Scottish air embraces you.

> Get ready to lace up your hiking boots, because National Park Week is upon us! Across the country, America's most stunning landscapes throw their gates wide open, inviting everyone to embrace the great outdoors for free. Throughout the celebration, various programs will be organized by the National Park Service, including ranger-led tours, volunteer opportunities, and educational workshops.
> 
> If you are in Wyoming, you might want to visit Yellowstone National Park, which was the world's first national park. Established in 1872 after the Protection Act was signed by President Ulysses S. Grant, the park is known for its flora, fauna—including Rocky Mountain wolves, and grizzly and black bears—super volcano, and many geothermal features, including the one we see in today's image. The Grand Prismatic Spring is in the Midway Geyser Basin. Its display of colors is caused by microbial mats, multi-layered sheets of microorganisms, ranging from deep blues and greens to fiery oranges and reds. There is so much waiting to be explored out there, so gather your friends, and get out into the wild.

> 在爱尔兰中心，在都柏林圣三一学院图书馆历史悠久的大厅里，卷轴和古籍低声诉说着久远的故事。今天，这些沉默的故事讲述者将大放异彩。世界图书日由联合国教科文组织于1995年设立，旨在提醒人们阅读、出版和版权的重要性。但为什么是4月23日呢？因为这一天是威廉·莎士比亚、米格尔·德·塞万提斯和其他几位文学巨匠共同的忌日！从每年在马里兰州肯辛顿举办的汇集众多作家、诗人和文学组织的街头庆祝活动，到世界各地许多国家向孩子们分发图书券，这一天在书页翻动的沙沙声中变得生机勃勃。有趣的是，联合国教科文组织每年都会推选一个城市为“世界图书之都”，被选中的城市将在被授予的一年中开展促进阅读的活动，今年当选是法国斯特拉斯堡。那么，你选好要读的书了吗？

> 三片花瓣、三片叶子和三个柱头——这就是白延龄草，它的名字源自拉丁语中的“三”，原产于北美东部，是春季最常见的林地野花之一。与一些稍有暖意就绽放色彩的“冲动型”花朵不同，这种植物开花缓慢。从美国邮票上的图案到俄亥俄州的州花，再到加拿大安大略省的官方象征，白延龄草扎根于各国文化。除了美观之外，白延龄草在草药界也有一席之地。所以，你在林间漫步时，请留意这种花卉珍品！
