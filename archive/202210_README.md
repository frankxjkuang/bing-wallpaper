> There are thousands of waterfalls in Yosemite National Park, but perhaps none are as well known as Bridalveil Fall. First things first: Don't call it 'falls' because then someone may think you were in Utah where another waterfall bears the surprisingly similar name, Bridal Veil Falls. Bridalveil, as seen in the photo, is often the first waterfall visitors to Yosemite encounter. It plunges 617 feet and flows year-round, fed with water from Ostrander Lake nearly 10 miles away. When the flow is light, brisk winds blow the water sideways. That's why the Ahwahneechee Native Americans, who have lived in the Yosemite Valley for centuries, traditionally called the waterfall Pohono, or 'Spirit of the Puffing Wind.'
> 
> When Yosemite was made a national park on this date in 1890, it not only preserved this jewel of the Sierra Nevada from being turned over to sheep grazing, it was also pivotal to the continued idea of protecting natural areas for the future. Scottish American environmentalist John Muir is credited with convincing President Benjamin Harrison to preserve the Yosemite Valley, and that success kicked off a string of conservation efforts that would eventually lead to the creation of the National Park System. Today, Yosemite's pristine wilderness is internationally known for mountains, granite cliffs, giant sequoia groves, and, of course, waterfalls.

<summary>Description</summary>

> October means pumpkin fields, Halloween, leaf-peeping, and the World Series. But in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the beginning of October means a skyful of hot air balloons. The 50th Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta is the largest gathering of balloonists in the world, with more than 500 hot air balloons going aloft this week. The now nine-day event got its start by launching 13 balloons from a shopping mall parking lot in 1972 to celebrate the birthday of a local radio station. It has easily become the biggest event of the year in Albuquerque, whose entire populace can view balloons in flight simply by stepping outside their homes and looking up.
> 
> The event is staged from the 365-acre Balloon Fiesta Park, on the northern outskirts of Albuquerque with the Sandia Mountains a few miles away. The Balloon Fiesta claims to be the most photographed event in the world, and it's easy to understand why. The highlight of the week is a mass ascension, in two waves, of all the balloons, decorated with every color and some shaped like animals or cartoon characters. In the age of jets and helicopters and rockets, this mass celebration of nearly silent flight reminds us that the magic of flying is not about speed, but simply reaching the sky.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In Belgium's largest city, the Antwerp Port Authority is housed in a century-old building that sports a gleaming new addition. The update to the building, known as the Port House, was the vision that Zaha Hadid created with her team at Zaha Hadid Architects, which won a 2009 competition to build the new structure around a 1911 firehouse. Work was completed in 2016, the same year the famed architect died. The expansion is intended to resemble the hull of a sailing ship with a protruding bow glimmering with diamonds, recalling Antwerp's longtime trade in precious stones.
> 
> Today we celebrate World Architecture Day and its 2022 theme of 'Architecture for well-being.' Architecture that preserves historic buildings by combining them with modern structures is becoming more prevalent as cities seek to retain the spirit of their earlier incarnations while creating new, modern spaces and never-before-seen constructions. Some famous examples of this style include the Brooklyn Museum in New York City, the Museum of Military History in Dresden, Germany, and another Hadid design, St. Antony's College in Oxford, England.

> Class trip? Looks like this teacher has their youngsters in line. If only it were always this easy.... Today is World Teachers' Day, and we're celebrating educators of all kinds. This year's theme is 'Teachers at the heart of educational renewal,' and it highlights the remarkable efforts of teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine. They've had to balance health and safety concerns with an abrupt switch to remote learning or partial in-person classes, all while focusing on the education and well-being of their students.

> Our flamingo teacher here may not have had to worry about COVID, but they certainly have their wings full. Though their gray charges don't look flamingo-y yet, they will. Flamingo youngsters, like those here at the Ría Lagartos Biosphere Reserve in Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula, develop the coloration of adults at around 1 to 2 years of age, so those trademark pink feathers will soon start to appear. The hot-pink coloring comes from the flamingo diet: They eat food that contains a lot of alpha and beta carotenoid pigments, such as algae, bugs, crustaceans, and mollusks.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The double-decker Oberbaum Bridge is one of Berlin's most beloved and iconic landmarks. For centuries the Oberbaum Bridge connected the two districts of Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg until they were separated by the Berlin Wall from 1961 to 1989. The first bridge at this spot was built in the 1700s, although the current road-and-rail Oberbaum was constructed at the end of the 19th century.
> 
> It remains an important symbol of unified Berlin, and a prominently featured landmark in the city's annual, weeklong Festival of Lights, which begins today. The international festival, now in its 18th year, transforms Berlin's buildings and landmarks with artful displays of light, as colors, patterns, and images are projected onto structures across the city. Here we see the Oberbaum all lit up for the 2020 festival—a far cry from its Cold War days. Despite growing concerns about an energy crisis in Germany this winter, Berlin's Festival of Lights will go on as planned in 2022, though in a scaled-down version, according to officials at the city government.

The 'Circle,' sculpted by Japanese artist Junkyu Muto and installed in 2008, is the third of seven 'peace sculptures' placed around the world. Twelve feet high and made of white marble, it's intended to evoke a puff of smoke from a Native American ceremonial pipe.

The vertical grooves in the tower are said to be the bear's claw marks.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> You may be surprised to learn that this elegant plant dappled with water droplets is a variety of moss: Tortula muralis, better known as wall screw-moss. It's found all over the world, even in urban areas where more sensitive mosses have a hard time thriving because of dry soil and air pollution. Mosses in general are accurate monitors of air pollution—they absorb air and water, so contaminants can also be measured in their cells.
> 
> Wall screw-moss is just one of at least 12,000 species of moss, ancient plants that date back 450 million years. The hardy bunch has weathered climate swings for eons, capable of surviving in icy tundra or scorching desert plains. They don't have roots—instead, they absorb moisture through hairlike rhizoids (which also act as anchors) on their surface. This ability to suck in water so efficiently makes mosses among the first plants to recover from forest fires or extreme heat, spreading out to stabilize the soil and keep it hydrated for other plants.
> 
> How appropriate, then, that our photograph captured raindrops on the moss. This is a perfect example of what's known as macro photography, when the image is many times larger than life-size. All the better to enjoy the delicate beauty of nature.

> Travel back 199 million years with a trip to the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site, a 95-mile-long stretch of coastline in southern England. This stunning fossil display is known as the Ammonite Pavement, where thousands of ammonite fossils are embedded in a limestone ledge at the west end of Monmouth Beach in Dorset. Although the ammonites look rather like snail shells, these are fossils of extinct sea creatures that are more closely related to today's octopus or squid. Britain's Natural History Museum notes that the fossil-filled ledge is unique in the world because of the sheer number and size of the ammonites: The fossils reach up to 27 inches in diameter. If you want to check them out, timing is everything—the ledge emerges at low tide, and there are more ammonites in large rocks nearby, too.

> After months of eating, roaming, and avoiding predators, Alaska moose spend autumn trying to propagate the species during what is called the rutting season, which runs from late September to early October. Males, called bulls, will mark their scent on trees to attract females. They’ll also fight other bulls for access to females, called cows.
> 
> Fights between bulls can sometimes be fatal, and occasionally a bull will have to wait until next year's rut to mate if it loses a fight. Virtually all cows have only one mate per year, but bulls can mate with 25 cows over a 12-month period.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The sheer size of Greenland is hard to put in perspective. The world's largest island is more than 836,000 square miles—that's more than three times the size of Texas and 170,000 square miles larger than Alaska. It is a land of deep fjords and thick ice that must have made the Norse explorers feel right at home when they landed there a thousand years ago.
> 
> Today we find ourselves at the southern tip of Greenland, in Prince Christian Sound, a fjord system 60 miles long, at times as narrow as 1,500 feet across. It flows through steep canyons of granite with slopes rising 1,200 feet above the water. The placid calm of these waters is frequently disrupted by calving glaciers, breaching whales, and the cruise ships that visit the region. The only human habitation in this frozen landscape is the Inuit village of Aappilattoq, home to about 100 people.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Whooo is that up in that tree? Why, that's just a typical long-eared owl, sometimes called the lesser horned owl or cat owl. It's one of the most numerous owl species in the world with an estimated population between 2 million and 5.5 million long-eared owls widely distributed across the Northern Hemisphere. Our featured friend today was found in the Czech Republic, but they'll adapt to several kinds of habitats.
> 
> Maybe that adaptability is why they're unusually social, as far as owls go. They'll often roost together in large groups—anywhere from 20 to 100 of them may hunker down together for the winter. You might think it would be easy to see such a large group of owls, but long-eared owls are sneaky. They hide in thick cover, which makes them harder to find, especially when their feathers blend in with the surrounding branches and foliage. Early spring, before the leaves have fully returned, is the most likely time you'd catch a glimpse of a 'parliament,' or group, of long-eared owls.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Considered one of the world's most important architectural works of the past few decades, the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao celebrates its 25th anniversary today. To commemorate the event, the museum has unveiled a slogan: 'Art Inspires Future.' The museum has also released a special edition of its logo in which the characteristic Gs of the Guggenheim brand move like gears to shape the number 25. Perhaps they'll serve cake as well?
> 
> Designed by famed Canadian American architect Frank Gehry, the museum not only changed the skyline of Bilbao, Spain, by transforming the city's decrepit port area, it changed the entire way the city was perceived by the world. Architect Philip Johnson called it 'the greatest building of our time.' The acclaim was echoed by critic Calvin Tomkins, writing in The New Yorker, who characterized it as 'a fantastic dream ship of undulating form in a cloak of titanium.'
> 
> Since its opening on this day in 1997, the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao is credited with renewing the Spanish city from a gritty industrial backwater into a glitzy travel hotspot—a metamorphosis now described as the 'Bilbao effect.' Cities around the world have been attempting to repeat the formula: Hire a 'starchitect' to put a neglected locale on the cultural map, which will in turn attract more investment, prestigious brands, and tourism. Some attempts have been more successful than others, but there's no denying that Bilbao has long since arrived.

<summary>Description</summary>

> As you glance over today's photo of the trees changing color in the Thuringian Forest in Germany, make note of the castle in the distance. That's Wartburg, a castle built in the Middle Ages that holds significance to Christians. It was the home of St. Elizabeth of Thuringia (aka St. Elizabeth of Hungary), and later, where Martin Luther translated the New Testament into German while in exile. Wartburg is the area's most popular tourist attraction and has been recognized for its quintessential medieval architecture.
> 
> There's some clever wordplay in the name Wartburg. 'Warte' is German for both 'watchtower' and 'wait.' Tradition suggests the castle's founder, upon seeing this forested hillside, exclaimed 'Warte, Berg—du sollst mir eine Burg tragen!' or 'Wait, mountain—you shall bear my castle!' Note the 'berg' and 'burg' in that quote, which translate to mountain and fortress, respectively. And so in the grand German tradition of mashing words together, the name Wartburg came to be.
> 
> If the castle isn't of interest to you, the Thuringian Forest, known as the Green Heart of Germany, has plenty of its own charm for tourists. The oldest and most popular long-distance hiking trail in Germany, the Rennsteig, runs for about 110 miles within the forest. If you're out for a hike you'll notice the general quietness of the area and fresh, unpolluted air. You may even happen upon the tiny villages that pepper the area and have a reputation for welcoming outsiders.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Is there another animal that has as coveted a life as the sloth? Your answer depends on how highly you rate the ability to just laze around all day, but in honor of International Sloth Day, let's all just embrace slothfulness. If you want to live the sloth life, head outside and hang upside down in the nearest tree. You won't be able to dangle there as long as a sloth though, because they spend most of their lives doing it. Their arms, legs, hands, and feet evolved for literally 'hanging around' like the pair of Hoffmann's two-toed sloths in today's photo.
> 
> Two-toed sloths might be better named as two-fingered: They have three toes on their hind legs. Even still, two-toed and three-toed sloths are distantly related, despite a shared preference for living the slow life in rainforests. The mother and child in today's photo are chilling together in a coastal town of Costa Rica. They won't be together forever, though, as part of the sloth's 'best life' is living alone. Adult sloths rarely interact with one another—though sometimes females will get together and, assumedly, hang out.
