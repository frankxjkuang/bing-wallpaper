> Today, Antarctica Day shines a spotlight on one of the world's most remarkable international agreements—the Antarctic Treaty. Signed in 1959 by 12 nations, this treaty designated the entire continent as a demilitarized zone, with a special focus on promoting scientific research and collaboration.. This day honors the spirit of global cooperation, reminding us of the collective responsibility to protect the planet's last great wilderness.
> 
> The name 'Antarctica' is derived from the ancient Greek word 'antarktikos,' meaning opposite the Arctic. The concept of an 'Antarctic region' was first mentioned by Greek philosopher Aristotle around 350 BCE. Despite this early reference, it wasn't until the 19th century that humans actually laid eyes on Antarctica. It is the coldest, driest, and windiest of the Earth's continents, with temperatures plunging as low as -112 degrees Fahrenheit. Vast ice sheets and glaciers found here hold about 70% of the world's fresh water. The waters are dotted with icebergs, as seen in today's image, which drift across the Southern Ocean and gradually melt over time. Species like Emperor and Adélie penguins, along with seals, mites, roundworms, and moss piglets, have made this icy habitat their permanent home.

> Grand palaces and towering forts shape the landscape of the Indian state of Rajasthan. Among the most prominent is Amber Fort, also known as Amer Fort or Amber Palace, which is perched on a small hill about 7 miles from the main city of Jaipur. Within its regal walls lies the Sattais Katcheri, which means 'court of 27 pillars,' featured in today's image. Amber Fort was built in 1592 and it served as the residence of the maharajas, or rulers, of the area. Famous for its unique blend of Hindu, Rajput, and Mughal architectural styles, it is constructed from pale yellow and pink sandstone alongside white marble. This masterpiece is spread across four levels, each with its own courtyard. Part of the wider Hill Forts of Rajasthan UNESCO World Heritage Site, Amber Fort invites visitors to explore a rich blend of history and royalty.

> It's Wildlife Conservation Day—an important reminder to celebrate and defend our planet's incredible biodiversity. Many species face extinction, including African forest elephants, Cross River gorillas, and Yangtze finless porpoises. Since its launch in 2012, this special day has highlighted illegal wildlife trade and other threats that animals face. It also draws attention to the need for stronger long-term solutions.
> 
> The journey of the white rhinoceros, featured in today's image, illustrates the importance of conservation efforts. They have two subspecies: the near-threatened southern white rhinoceros and the critically endangered northern white rhinoceros. In the late 19th century, the southern white rhino, found in South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, and Kenya, was on the brink of extinction due to relentless poaching for their horns. But thanks to more than a century of dedicated management, their numbers have bounced back significantly. Unfortunately, the northern white rhino is in a precarious situation, with only two left—a mother and daughter. They're now under protection at Kenya's Ol Pejeta Conservancy.

> Shaped by the slow passage of time, tufa—a type of porous limestone—emerges as one of nature's most spectacular formations. While these towers can be found in many places, today's image shows some at Mono Lake in Mono County, California. These structures develop when calcium-rich fresh water, flowing into the lake from several creeks and streams, mixes with the lake's alkaline water. Over centuries, this interaction caused calcium carbonate to build up, forming tufa spires above the lake's surface. To preserve the tufa towers, the Mono Lake Tufa State Natural Reserve was established in 1981.
> 
> Mono Lake is a fascinating desert lake with hypersaline and alkaline waters and no natural outlet. It supports a thriving ecosystem teeming with billions of brine shrimp and alkali flies. These tiny creatures are essential snacks for a variety of migratory birds, like California gulls and eared grebes. As a food source, Mono Lake is a critical pit stop along the Pacific Flyway, a major migration route for birds journeying from Alaska all the way south to Patagonia.

> Happy Independence Day, Finland! On this day in 1917, the Nordic nation declared its independence from Russia. Finland had been a grand duchy of the Russian Empire since 1809, and it was part of the Swedish Empire for the previous 600 years. However, during the Russian revolutions of 1917, Finnish nationalists saw their chance to establish an independent nation. After several months of negotiations, Finland declared independence on December 6.
> 
> Independence Day celebrations officially begin when the Finnish flag is raised on Tähtitorninmäki (Observatory Hill) in Helsinki. People across the country place two blue-and-white candles in their windows, a tradition dating back to the 19th century when two candles were a symbol of Finnish nationalism. In university towns, students take to the streets for torchlit processions. The day's celebrations culminate at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki. It's here that Linnan juhlat (the Castle Ball) takes place. This special gala is broadcast live and watched by millions across the country.

> Today, the country remembers 'a date which will live in infamy.' President Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke these words to Congress in 1941, the day after Japan's attack on the Pearl Harbor naval base in Oahu, Hawaii. The destruction inflicted on the US Pacific Fleet is one of military history's most devastating surprise attacks. More than 3,500 US servicepeople were killed or wounded, and eight battleships were destroyed or damaged in less than two hours. Following Roosevelt's speech came a declaration of war and the entrance of the US into World War II. Congress named December 7 National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day in 1994.
> 
> The Pearl Harbor National Memorial holds an annual observance, but other places have also commemorated the event. Today's image is of the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge in New Haven, Connecticut. Locally known as the Q Bridge, it carries the I-95 over the mouth of the Quinnipiac River. In 1995, this innovative bridge replaced an older one and was renamed. With cannons of light that shoot up to the sky and a red, white, and blue lighting scheme on patriotic holidays, the Q Bridge is a poignant reminder of a dark chapter in the nation's history.
