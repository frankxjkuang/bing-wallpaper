> Today, Antarctica Day shines a spotlight on one of the world's most remarkable international agreements—the Antarctic Treaty. Signed in 1959 by 12 nations, this treaty designated the entire continent as a demilitarized zone, with a special focus on promoting scientific research and collaboration.. This day honors the spirit of global cooperation, reminding us of the collective responsibility to protect the planet's last great wilderness.

> The name 'Antarctica' is derived from the ancient Greek word 'antarktikos,' meaning opposite the Arctic. The concept of an 'Antarctic region' was first mentioned by Greek philosopher Aristotle around 350 BCE. Despite this early reference, it wasn't until the 19th century that humans actually laid eyes on Antarctica. It is the coldest, driest, and windiest of the Earth's continents, with temperatures plunging as low as -112 degrees Fahrenheit. Vast ice sheets and glaciers found here hold about 70% of the world's fresh water. The waters are dotted with icebergs, as seen in today's image, which drift across the Southern Ocean and gradually melt over time. Species like Emperor and Adélie penguins, along with seals, mites, roundworms, and moss piglets, have made this icy habitat their permanent home.
