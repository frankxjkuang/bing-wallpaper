> Do you feel as if you have a whole year's worth of rest to catch up on? Then you can relate to this Arctic fox, cozily tucked among the rocky outcroppings of the frozen tundra. Whether the new year greets you with biting cold or under a warm sun, take five extra minutes to stretch before diving into the 365 days ahead.
> 
> Ever wondered why we have 365 days in a year? It's because the Gregorian calendar—introduced in 1582—is based on a solar year: the time it takes Earth to orbit the sun. The stars have our backs, but the plans we make for the months ahead are all on us.
> 
> Let's start the year with a clean slate. Here are a few ideas for New Year's resolutions. Simple things like reading, taking nature walks, or practicing mindfulness cost nothing and can really boost your quality of life. Or maybe you're dreaming bigger: moving abroad, taking up scuba diving, or learning an endangered language? Take a deep breath—and perhaps sleep on it a little longer.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Seeing Venice from above is mesmerizing, but this Italian gem's true magic lies within its walls and waterways. Founded in the 5th century on a cluster of islands in the Venetian Lagoon, the early settlement rose from marshland to become a maritime powerhouse. By the Middle Ages, it had evolved into a major hub for trade between Europe and the East, fueling immense wealth and cultural growth. The city's grandeur shines through its Gothic palaces, Renaissance art, and landmarks such as St. Mark's Basilica, the Doge's Palace, and the Rialto Bridge.
> 
> Venice is celebrated not only for its iconic architecture and interwoven canals but also for the brilliant minds who shaped its legacy. 'The Travels of Marco Polo' chronicles the adventures of the Venetian merchant and explorer, and Antonio Vivaldi—composer of 'The Four Seasons'—was also born here. The city has inspired timeless works, including Thomas Mann's 'Death in Venice,' Shakespeare's 'The Merchant of Venice' and 'Othello,' and Henry James's novella 'The Aspern Papers.'
> 
> Today, Venice balances historic charm with modern challenges—from preserving fragile architecture to managing tourism. Gondolas glide past centuries-old facades, while festivals like Carnevale keep traditions alive.

> Our picture of the day takes us to the Swiss village of Lauterbrunnen, where the Staubbach Falls shimmers in the distance beyond a quiet alpine valley. This is the landscape a young traveler, J.R.R. Tolkien, crossed during a hiking trip in 1911, long before he became the storyteller behind 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit.' Its soaring cliffs, silver waterfalls, and crisp mountain air left a lasting impression and are believed to have inspired his vision of Rivendell, the elven refuge hidden deep in Middle-earth.
> 
> On January 3—Tolkien's birthday—fans across the globe celebrate Tolkien Day, raising a toast at 9 PM to 'The Professor.' The tradition, started by The Tolkien Society in 1972, recalls both Frodo's toast to Bilbo and the writer's years at Oxford, where he spent a lifetime shaping modern fantasy—interweaving language, legend, and moral courage into timeless tales. Today, admirers honor not just an author but a world-maker—one who showed that even the smallest journey can lead to greatness, and that wonder awaits, ever-present, just beyond the familiar.

> Kings Mountain in Alaska's Chugach Mountains isn't just another bump on the horizon—it's the kind of rugged beauty that makes you slow down and stare. Rising over 5,800 feet and sitting roughly 22 miles northeast of Palmer, this peak towers over mile 75 of the Glenn Highway, a route famous for its dramatic scenery. Its slopes bear the marks of ancient glaciers, etched into ridges and valleys that seem tailor-made for adventure.
> 
> The Dena'ina name, Bashtl'ech' (black stone), speaks to its cultural roots, while its English name honors Al King, a prospector from Alaska's gold rush days. Today, hikers and climbers come for the challenge: steep ascents, unpredictable weather, and views so sweeping they feel like a hard-earned reward. On clear days, the Matanuska Glacier glimmers in the distance, and wildflowers brighten the rocky terrain, reminding you that even Alaska's wilderness has a soft side. Pack layers and a sense of humor—the weather changes fast—but if you're lucky, standing atop Kings Mountain feels like shaking hands with the sky.

> Picture a city where your daily commute offers views of fjords, drifting ice, and the Northern Lights. That's everyday life in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland—a small yet spirited Arctic hub blending Inuit heritage with Nordic modernity. Founded in 1728 by Danish-Norwegian missionary Hans Egede, it began as a small settlement called Godthaab—'Good Hope.'
> 
> Nuuk preserves 18th-century landmarks like the Hans Egede House and the red wooden Nuuk Cathedral. The Greenland National Museum displays Inuit artifacts and the well-preserved Qilakitsoq mummies, offering a glimpse into the island's deep past. This city is also home to the world's only Arctic golf course. But it's not just the sights that define Nuuk—it's how people come together when the cold sets in.
> 
> Winter brings short days and snowfall, yet the city buzzes with life. People head out for cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, boating, or dog sledding along the fjords. Indoors, friends gather for 'kaffemik'—a cozy coffee-and-cake tradition with strong Greenlandic coffee topped with whipped cream. Nuuk shows that life in the cold isn't about endurance—it's about balance, community, and finding color even in the depths of winter.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today is a day that puts time into perspective. Old Rock Day highlights the vast geological processes that have shaped our world since its earliest eras. In Arches National Park, Utah, Turret Arch—seen through North Window—offers a striking reminder: landscapes can take hundreds of millions of years to assemble. The Entrada Sandstone that forms these arches began as shifting dunes and shallow seas long before erosion carved today's shapes. Even so, these formations are relatively young. Most rocks on Earth disappear over time because plate tectonics, erosion, and volcanism continually recycle the crust. Only the planet's ancient continental shields preserve truly old material. Canada's Acasta Gneiss, about 4 billion years old, is the oldest known rock still rooted where it formed.
> 
> Old Rock Day also remembers the pioneers of geology. Theophrastus and Pliny the Elder recorded early mineral studies, while Ulisse Aldrovandi helped establish the term 'geology' in 1603. One hundred fifty years later, William Smith drew the first geological map. And in 1785, James Hutton revealed the Earth's immense age, providing insights that continue to shape our understanding of the ground beneath our feet.

<summary>Description</summary>

> When a bird is called a starling, you'd expect it to be a bit of a show-off. True to its name, this little creature knows how to steal the spotlight. From shimmering feathers that glint green and purple in the sun, to its ability to mimic sounds, the starling is the headline act. Originally native to Europe and Asia, the common starling has spread across the globe. In the 19th century, a group of them were introduced to New York's Central Park by an enthusiast of birds mentioned in Shakespeare's plays.
> 
> Brighton's West Pier may be a ruin, but when starlings gather above it, the scene is anything but broken. Each evening in autumn and winter, thousands of these small birds twist and turn in the air. The spectacle is called a murmuration, a term as musical as the sound of wings beating in unison. Scientists suggest the birds swoop and swirl to confuse predators, keep warm and share information about roosting spots. Whatever the reason, the result is a dance that has visitors gazing upward, phones in hand, hoping to catch a glimpse before the flock settles for the night.

<summary>Description</summary>

> On January 11, 1944, Morocco took a bold step toward freedom. Sixty-six leaders signed the Proclamation of Independence, demanding an end to French and Spanish colonial rule and affirming the country's right to sovereignty. This manifesto, backed by Sultan Mohammed V, was presented not only to colonial authorities but also to representatives of the US, UK, and the former Soviet Union—a signal that Morocco's struggle was part of a global call for self-determination. Though repression followed, the movement endured, and by 1956 Morocco achieved full independence, marking a turning point in North African history.
> 
> Today, that spirit of resilience echoes in Chefchaouen, the 'Blue Pearl' of the Rif Mountains. Founded in the 15th century as a fortress against Portuguese incursions, the city later adopted its signature blue palette—a tradition some trace to Jewish influence and others to Andalusian roots. Wandering through its serene alleys, where indigo walls meet crisp mountain air, feels like stepping into a living canvas—a reminder that Morocco's story is painted in courage, culture, and color.

> The clue isn't the tracks in the snow—it's the frosted faces peeking out like they've just discovered winter. Estonia is one of Europe's best places to spot Eurasian otters, thanks to its clean rivers, wide wetlands, and snack-filled coastline. This protected species was named Estonia's Animal of the Year in 2024. While globally considered near threatened, their population here has grown substantially, reaching an estimated 2,000 in recent years, up from a historic low of just 300 before the turn of the millennium.
> 
> From Soomaa National Park's flooded forests to Matsalu National Park's calm shallows, these mammals—with their streamlined bodies, webbed feet, and long tails—weave through the country's waters with ease. Their thick fur traps warm air, allowing them to dive into cold Baltic currents without hesitation. While they look cute, their hunting skills are sharp: they track fish, frogs, and crustaceans with precision.
> 
> Unlike their sea otter cousins, Eurasian otters tend to work solo, but in Estonia's wetlands, neighbors aren't far away. They communicate with whistles, chirps, and occasional snorts. When pups arrive, the banks become playful classrooms where young otters learn to swim, eat, and master the 'oops, did I splash you?' face.

> Most people wrap up their New Year plans by the first week of January. Wales, however, has a charming habit of saying, 'Hold on—we've got one more celebration left.' Enter Hen Galan, the 'Old New Year,' observed on January 13 in parts of Wales, most famously in the Gwaun Valley. The date survives from the old Julian calendar, kept long after the rest of Britain adopted the Gregorian one.
> 
> Alongside Hen Galan is Calennig, a tradition rooted in the Welsh word for 'New Year's gift.' Children lead the festivities with decorated apples—fruit studded with cloves, topped with holly, and balanced on three wooden legs. They carry the apples from house to house, reciting cheerful rhymes in exchange for coins or treats. In the past, kids would also carry jugs of water to splash on people's hands and faces or sprinkle around the house for luck.
> 
> Today, Calennig is less widespread than it once was, but the practice hasn't vanished. Schools still teach the old verses for Hen Galan, and local groups keep the customs alive. And if you ever want to see a place with apple-growing heritage, visit the Vale of Clwyd, featured in today's image.

> National Take the Stairs Day, observed on the second Wednesday of January, encourages everyone to add small bursts of movement to daily life. Choosing stairs instead of elevators, or fitting in a short walk or bike ride, helps build healthier habits. With millions living with chronic lung disease and air quality concerns growing, simple actions that strengthen our bodies matter more than ever.
> 
> If you want to mark the day with a climb to remember, the Fortress of Palamidi has you covered. Rising 709 feet above the city of Nafplio in Greece, this Venetian-built stronghold dates back to 1714. This impressive fortification has eight bastions, each designed as an independent unit so that if one fell, the others could still be defended. The Ottomans captured the fortress a year after completion, and Greece reclaimed it in 1822, renaming the bastions after heroes like Achilles and Leonidas. Today, visitors often test themselves on the fortress's famous staircase—once believed to have 999 steps, though the actual count is 857. At the top, sweeping views of the Argolic Gulf make every step worthwhile.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Tucked deep within Norway's Arctic Circle, Reine feels like the kind of place you see on a postcard and assume can't possibly be real. But it is. This small fishing village of about 300 residents is known for its steep mountains, calm fjords, and bright red rorbuer—traditional fishermen's cabins—that dot the shoreline. Despite its size, Reine draws thousands of visitors each year.
> 
> For most of its history, Reine has been a working village. It served as a trading post in the 1700s, and fishing has always been the backbone of daily life. Even during World War II, when parts of the village were burned by German forces, locals rebuilt and carried on. Today, people come for all kinds of experiences. Some climb Reinebringen for its sweeping views; others wander the shoreline or try a plate of fish that was probably caught that morning. Staying in a restored cabin offers a glimpse of what life here looked like before tourism arrived. What makes Reine memorable isn't a list of 'must-do' activities; it's the history, tradition, and sense of community that settle in the moment you arrive.

<summary>Description</summary>

> If you've ever watched a wildlife documentary, you know the moment: the camera pans across a quiet savanna, and suddenly a leopard appears as if it has been there all along. That quiet reveal says everything about how these cats operate. They move with precision, slipping through grass and branches without making a sound. Their build, muscular but lean, helps them climb, sprint, and hide in plain sight. Their rosetted coats? No two patterns match, each serving as natural camouflage from sunrise to moonlight.
> 
> These skilled swimmers follow no strict diet. They prey on antelopes when available, switch to hares or birds when needed, and sometimes hunt at waterholes where other animals gather. When leopards secure a kill, they often cache it safely in a tree or a cave, using their strong forelimbs to keep it away from lions and hyenas.
> 
> Leopards range across sub-Saharan Africa, India, Sri Lanka, and small regions of Central and West Asia. Today's image was taken in Etosha National Park, in north-central Namibia, a haven for Africa's iconic wildlife. Established in 1907, the park is home to elephants, lions, cheetahs, black rhinos, wildebeests, zebras, and steenboks—and gives leopards space to hunt and room to roam.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Walk into any large square in Naples, Italy, and the city's history comes into focus. Arched galleries, sweeping colonnades, and domes that echo ancient architecture compete for your attention. Every street shifts in style—compact Baroque facades give way to broad Neoclassical courtyards. Continue exploring, and you will arrive at a wide square with a building that appears Roman at first sight. That's the Basilica of San Francesco di Paola, located on the west side of Piazza del Plebiscito.
> 
> Completed in 1846, the basilica took shape after Ferdinand I, King of the Two Sicilies, returned to power and continued the construction begun under King Joachim Murat of Naples. The design followed strict Neoclassical principles: a circular body, a triangular pediment, and a dome modeled after the Pantheon—a famous second-century Roman temple.
> 
> Inside, the geometry continues with polished marble, broad arches, and chapels spaced along the circular walkway. The piazza features a curving colonnade that borders the basilica and frames its dome. Planning a trip to Naples? Piazza del Plebiscito awaits you.

<summary>Description</summary>

> If 'Frozen' traded ice for sand, the result would look a lot like White Sands National Park in New Mexico—cool, white dunes that deceive the eye at first glance. It became a national monument on this day in 1933, established to protect a rare geological phenomenon: the world's largest gypsum dunefield. These dunes were formed from gypsum crystals that broke down over thousands of years, creating bright waves that stay cool even in summer.
> 
> Rising from the heart of the Tularosa Basin, the park spans 275 square miles. Beneath that brightness lies a story far older than the park itself. Paleontologists uncovered fossilized human footprints alongside mammoths and giant ground sloths, providing one of the strongest records of Ice Age movement on the continent.
> 
> For all its starkness, the dunes still support a steady rhythm of survival. The soaptree yucca sends up tall stalks, while shrubs anchor themselves deep underground. Animals, including the Apache pocket mouse, bleached earless lizard, and sand-treader camel cricket, blend into the pale terrain. When filmmakers need a landscape that looks otherworldly, this place is dressed for the part. 'The Man Who Fell to Earth,' 'The Book of Eli,' and 'Transformers' all borrowed its 'Moon-on-Earth' glow.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In the summer heat of 1963, a quarter of a million people gathered at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, for one of the largest demonstrations in our history. Segregation still dictated where people could live, learn, vote, and work; the nation simmered with tension—and the world was watching. At that moment, Martin Luther King, Jr. stepped forward, a Baptist minister and the strategic heart of the civil rights movement. He fought injustice with discipline, clarity, and nonviolent resolve, delivering a vision that reshaped the nation's imagination: a future where freedom was real, dignity was universal, and justice extended to all.
> 
> Today we celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day, observed on the third Monday of January. The holiday honors his birth and the impact of his work, from the Montgomery Bus Boycott to the Selma marches. These victories challenged legalized discrimination and paved the way for landmark civil rights legislation. The day is both a tribute and a call to action: progress must be relentlessly built, protected, and pushed forward—and King's legacy urges every generation to push the nation closer to the dream he dared to dream aloud.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Penguins thrive in some of Earth's coldest waters. Today's image shows a gentoo penguin beneath a vault of shimmering blue ice, its sharp silhouette etched against the frozen world around it. Penguin Awareness Day, observed on January 20, shines a spotlight on the birds that bring life, noise, and personality to Earth's iciest coastlines.
> 
> The gentoo is among the most agile swimmers of all penguins. With strong flippers and a sleek, tapered build, it can navigate icy waters with quick, confident bursts of speed. Its bright bill, bold white head stripe, and upright posture make it instantly recognizable, even in colonies where thousands of birds gather along the shore.
> 
> Many gentoos gather on Petermann Island, a rocky outpost off the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, shaped by volcanic cliffs, wind-carved ledges, and snow-dusted beaches. The island's exposed rock provides nesting space for breeding pairs. Surrounding waters sustain the busy routines of feeding, preening, and raising chicks in tightly packed groups—animating the stark polar landscape.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today's image shows a Eurasian red squirrel perched in the snow, displaying the winter fur and tufted ears that make this species so striking. Native to forests across Europe and parts of Asia, red squirrels rely on seeds, nuts, and fungi, stashing food in scattered caches and building nests high in hollow trees to survive the colder months.
> 
> Squirrel Appreciation Day, observed on January 21, began in 2001 when wildlife rehabilitator Christy Hargrove encouraged people to show more kindness toward these quick, bright-eyed foragers. Despite their reputation as garden raiders or urban 'nuisances,' squirrels play essential roles in local ecosystems. Their tendency to bury food and forget some of it helps forests regenerate, especially in areas where conifer seeds spread through these accidental plantings.
> 
> In the United States, this day highlights the adaptability of these animals, thriving in forests, city parks, and suburban landscapes wherever shelter and scattered food sources exist.
