> 如果你计划在新年第一天跳进冰冷刺骨的湖泊或海湾，那么你就会明白我们今天为什么要展示这张拍摄于挪威斯瓦尔巴群岛的照片。世界各地的人们常常在新年第一天像北极熊一样跳进水里。无论他们是为了慈善、忏悔，还是为了惊世骇俗，这都是迎接新年第一天的最好的方式。当然，对于北极熊来说，这可没什么特别的，不过是它们每天的日常而已。

> If your first scheduled activity of the day has ever involved intentionally jumping into an icy lake or a frigid bay, then you understand the relevance of today's image from the Svalbard Islands of Norway. Polar bear plunges, as these swims have come to be known, take place all over the world, often on New Year's Day. Whether people take the plunge for charity, penance, or shock value, there's no better way to put an exclamation point on the first day of the year. Of course, for actual polar bears, ice cold plunges are an everyday occurrence and won't elicit much more than a yawn.

<summary>Description</summary>

> For the charming Hohenzollern Castle, the third time really was the charm. Constructed on the top of Hohenzollern Mountain in the 11th century, the castle was largely ruined by a 10-month siege in 1423, only to be rebuilt a few decades later. It then served as an important strategic stronghold before again falling into disrepair. In the 19th century, King Frederick William IV of Prussia, best remembered for his commitment to building great works across Germany, had a new castle built on the grounds, replacing almost all the 15th-century construction. Today, Hohenzollern Castle is an open-air museum that hosts more than 350,000 visitors per year, making it one of the most-visited castles in Germany.

> Hey, don't judge. Migrating takes it out of you! Yes, these sandhill cranes are sleeping on their feet in the waters of the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge in southern New Mexico. The birds start arriving around Halloween each year, and as many as 10,000 of them will stay to rest and feed in local fields until February. What's on the menu? Well, sandhill cranes aren't picky; they'll eat whatever's available, from plants and grains, to insects, snails, and even snakes. And they have plenty of avian company at this beautiful refuge each winter—whooping cranes, ducks, and snow geese from as far away as Alaska and Siberia also count Bosque del Apache as a favorite resting spot before heading north to their breeding grounds when the days get warmer. Thankfully, there's plenty of room to spread their wings at the 57,000-acre refuge.

Big, bold, and beautiful, the event features more than 2,000 ice sculptures made from 240,000 cubic yards of ice collected by nearly a thousand workers from the nearby Songhua River. Many of the sculptures are illuminated with colored lights, creating a vibrant, glowing world of ice. It's estimated the colorful sights attract more than 18 million visitors each year. The event, which runs through late February, also features alpine skiing, cold water swimming in the aforementioned Songhua, as well as a festive ice lantern show.

> Today's lovely landscape requires a slight bit of explanation. We're at Black Fell, which can be found in the Lake District of England. The term 'fell' originates from the Old Norse term for mountain, but it mostly applies to high, barren areas and, in the Lake District specifically, the area was usually uncultivated and used for grazing. Black Fell, which is a little over 1,000 feet high, has some acclaim, having been mentioned in Alfred Wainwright's 'Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells' as a prime viewing area. No matter which direction you gaze, you're sure to see something wonderful.

Truth be told, we're not convinced that it's really cause for celebration, since it marked women's return to spinning work after Christmas, following 12 blissful, chore-free days.

> The distaff is a tool that predates the invention of the spinning wheel. It holds wool neatly in place before it's spun on the spindle. Distaff Day symbolizes women's vital role in producing textiles for their communities and, just like the distaff, keeping everything in order and running smoothly.

> Between the more famous national parks of Yellowstone and the Badlands lies Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota. Established 120 years ago, this national park is home to one of only four wild herds of genetically pure bison in North America. The two in our image are the descendants of 20 bison saved from slaughter by conservationists in the early 1900s. At the time, fewer than 1,000 wild bison were left alive out of a population that once numbered 50 million. Above ground, the park is the largest grass prairie in the country. Below ground lies one of the most extensive cave systems in the world. As the weather above changes, air flows into and out of the caves creating the wind for which the park was named.

The annual event began informally in 2016 and was later adopted by the American Lung Association. It's an ingenious way to nudge people to exercise—most of us encounter stairs during our day, so there's really no excuse. Climbing stairs is a low-impact activity that raises your heart rate and burns calories.

> Of course, you may not have access to a cool, curly staircase like this beauty, which is actually a sculpture rather than a conduit. 'Umschreibung' is tucked away in an office building complex in Munich's Schwanthalerhöhe district. Creator Olafur Eliasson says he intended the sculpture—known locally as 'The Stairway to Heaven'—to convey 'movement without destination, a space defined by motion rather than walls.' Mission accomplished.

This winter dusting of Istanbul, Türkiye's largest city, brings into sharper focus the lines of Rumelihisarı in the center of our image. The structure, also known as Rumeli Fortress, was built in the 15th century by an Ottoman sultan as a way to choke naval traffic through the narrow Bosporus Strait. The Bosporus connects the Sea of Marmara to the Black Sea, separating Istanbul into what are often referred to as its 'European side' and 'Asian side.' Today, the fortress isn't used to fire upon ships but serves as a museum and concert venue. While the place has changed over the centuries, the killer view hasn't.

> Perhaps surprisingly, there are no quotes from Dr. King's famous 'I Have a Dream' speech. That's not an oversight, though: The whole memorial has that legendary speech as its theme.

> 今天的照片是否让你感觉到一丝寒冷？其实这不是雪，而是地球上最大的石膏沙漠。这是位于新墨西哥州的白沙国家公园，在过去的1.2万年里，周围的山脉产生了约45亿吨雪白的石膏沙。这里最初于1933年1月18日被指定为白沙国家纪念地，然后在2019年正式成为白沙国家公园。如今，这座国家公园里生活着成千上万的物种，其中许多物种已经逐渐进化出了白色，以便更好融入环境。

> If today's photo evokes some chilly feelings inside of you, surprise! That's not snow, but part of the largest gypsum dune field on the planet. We're at White Sands National Park in New Mexico, which was first established as a monument on this date in 1933 and then became a national park in 2019. Roughly 4.5 billion tons of gypsum sand has massed in the Tularosa Basin over the past 12,000 years, having worn off the surrounding mountains. Thousands of species live in the park, many of which have evolved to have white coloration, allowing them to blend into the environment.

> As beautiful as this vista is, most of today's visitors to Park City are there to spend the day inside. Sundance Film Festival, the nation's biggest celebration of independent cinema, opens today and runs through January 29. The careers of Hollywood directors such as Quentin Tarantino and Steven Soderbergh were launched here, and every year a new crop of greenhorns arrives in this mountain enclave with the dream that they'll leave with a distribution deal.
> 
> It's a common misconception that the festival was founded by Robert Redford. It was actually started as the Utah Film Festival in Salt Lake City in 1978 by Sterling Van Wagenen, who then brought on Redford as chairman. Redford has remained involved with the festival ever since, presiding over its move to Park City and transformation into the largest festival of its kind in the United States. In the past decade, Sundance London and Sundance Hong Kong have expanded the mission of the Sundance Institute.
