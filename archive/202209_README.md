<summary>Description</summary>

> This idyllic road is a path to one of Italy's magnificent natural gifts. Just outside of the ancient city of Pisa in Tuscany is the Regional Park of Migliarino, San Rossore, Massaciuccoli. This immense and diverse park boasts numerous distinct environments. A visitor will discover, by turns, seaside sand dunes, marshlands, and vast forests of pine, oak, and elm. A wide array of birds can also be found in the park, along with ample wild boar, rabbits, red foxes, and the impressively antlered fallow deer. It's even been suggested that there are wolves living in the deep reaches of the woods.
> 
> While the park is popular for its beaches, forests, and wildlife, it offers cultural attractions as well. There are Roman ruins to be explored here, along with working farms, and environmental education opportunities. It's also home to the Villa del Gombo, once an official residence of the president of Italy. The villa was built in the 1950s on the site of a ruined old hunting lodge once owned by the Royal House of Savoy. Today the facility hosts conferences and tourists.

<summary>Description</summary>

> In shallow areas of the tropical Indo-Pacific, you'll come across the blue linckia sea star. Oftentimes it's found anchored to or hiding under rocks. This duo was spotted near the coast of New Ireland, an island in Papua New Guinea. Even though 'blue' is in the name, this species of sea star has also been observed in purple, pink, or orange. The vibrant colors make the linckia popular in the seashell trade, unfortunately, and intensive poaching has diminished their populations. But new research could lead to calls for their protection: Scientists have studied potential anti-tumor and antibacterial properties inherent to the blue linckia.

<summary>Description</summary>

> It's not just chickens that cross the road. Wild creatures from frogs to elk roll the dice with death when they need to traverse the thousands of highways humans have threaded through wildlife habitat. Sadly, the dice don't fall favorably for millions of animals each year, and collisions with vehicles often cause fatalities for both them and the drivers who hit them.
> 
> Many countries now construct wildlife crossings—also called green bridges, ecoducts, natuurbrugs (like this one in Wierden in the Netherlands), and écoponts (in France). These can be either overpasses or underpasses, and they are an expensive venture. Are they worth it? Well, officials in Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada, would say categorically yes. Over 20 years they built 44 bridges and underpasses so wildlife could cross the Trans-Canada Highway, which divides the park; traffic accidents involving wildlife dropped by 80%.
> 
> France built the first overland wildlife crossings in the 1950s and continues to invest in many elaborate safe passageways. But the Netherlands leads the initiative, with an impressive 600-plus wildlife crossings, and counting. In fact, the Dutch can claim the honors for the world's longest animal crossing too—the Natuurbrug Zanderij Crailoo is an overpass that's half a mile long and 55 yards wide. Now chickens and their four-legged friends can cross the road anytime, no questions asked.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Crete is the largest and most populous of all the Greek islands, and also the farthest from the mainland (in fact, it's just about halfway to Turkey). This big little island is small enough to drive across in a few hours but full of wonders, from mountain ranges to gorges to beautiful beaches. Take this jewel box of turquoise water near the port city of Chania, for example. Set on the easternmost of three peninsulas that stick out like horns from the northwest shoreline of Crete, Seitan Limania is one of the most photographed beaches on the island.
> 
> Seitan Limania is beautiful to behold from a distance but driving up close via the narrow switchback roads takes some nerve. And once you get to the parking lot, the rocky hike down is for only the most surefooted of beachgoers. On your way down, you'll likely meet some of the goats that populate the area. The narrow cove is flanked by steep rock walls that zig one way, then zag the other. When you reach the beach, you'll find yourself on one of the most beautiful spots on any coast—and a selfie here at Seitan Limania is hard to beat for bragging rights.

<summary>Description</summary>

> 印度以其巨大的、人口稠密的城市而闻名，同时它也拥有看似无尽的海岸线。在西南海岸的果阿邦，你再也找不到比阿兰博尔更慵懒可爱的地方了。阿兰博尔是一个非常受欢迎的度假小镇，充满着沉睡渔村的氛围，其实这里曾经还真是一个渔村。如今，这里的热带气候、雨林山谷、历史建筑、沙滩、蔚蓝海水和摇曳的椰子树吸引着来自世界各地的游客，他们为阿兰博尔带来了新的活力。
> 
> 果阿邦与印度的大部分地区不同，因为这里曾是葡萄牙的殖民地，而当时印度其他地区是英国殖民地。葡萄牙帝国在16世纪初征服并开始统治果阿邦，直到1961年该地区被印度收复。你可以在果阿邦的天主教教堂和修道院中看到葡萄牙人对该地区的影响，该州最大城市是瓦斯科·达伽马，正是以曾经统治果阿邦的探险家的名字命名。
> 
> 如果你对历史不感兴趣，在太阳下山前的几个小时里，阿兰博尔还会举办非常出名的鼓圈活动和跳蚤市场。这个时候的阿兰博尔既是市场，又是海滩派对。手工艺人在这里出售手工制品，而音乐家则进行即兴表演。人们在沙滩、香料和阳光中结束在果阿完美的一天。

> 如果你想要来一趟孤独的旅程，挑战自己的生理极限或检验自己的心理健康程度，你可以考虑踏上加拿大的跨太加路。这条路修建之初，是为了通往魁北克北部的几座水电大坝，路上极少有行人，更是几乎没有游客。
> 
> 跨太加路穿过北美大陆最与世隔绝的地区。它从詹姆斯湾公路的544公里处分支出来，其修建之初，是为了通往魁北克水电公司在格朗德河和卡尼亚皮斯科河修建的几座水电大坝。
> 
> 在这条路上，你会欣赏到开阔的风景，低矮的山丘和云杉树。这里没有什么醒目的地标，不过你会在39英里处和362英里处各看到一个水库。
