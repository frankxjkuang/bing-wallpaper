> It's not just chickens that cross the road. Wild creatures from frogs to elk roll the dice with death when they need to traverse the thousands of highways humans have threaded through wildlife habitat. Sadly, the dice don't fall favorably for millions of animals each year, and collisions with vehicles often cause fatalities for both them and the drivers who hit them.
> 
> Many countries now construct wildlife crossings—also called green bridges, ecoducts, natuurbrugs (like this one in Wierden in the Netherlands), and écoponts (in France). These can be either overpasses or underpasses, and they are an expensive venture. Are they worth it? Well, officials in Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada, would say categorically yes. Over 20 years they built 44 bridges and underpasses so wildlife could cross the Trans-Canada Highway, which divides the park; traffic accidents involving wildlife dropped by 80%.
> 
> France built the first overland wildlife crossings in the 1950s and continues to invest in many elaborate safe passageways. But the Netherlands leads the initiative, with an impressive 600-plus wildlife crossings, and counting. In fact, the Dutch can claim the honors for the world's longest animal crossing too—the Natuurbrug Zanderij Crailoo is an overpass that's half a mile long and 55 yards wide. Now chickens and their four-legged friends can cross the road anytime, no questions asked.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Crete is the largest and most populous of all the Greek islands, and also the farthest from the mainland (in fact, it's just about halfway to Turkey). This big little island is small enough to drive across in a few hours but full of wonders, from mountain ranges to gorges to beautiful beaches. Take this jewel box of turquoise water near the port city of Chania, for example. Set on the easternmost of three peninsulas that stick out like horns from the northwest shoreline of Crete, Seitan Limania is one of the most photographed beaches on the island.
> 
> Seitan Limania is beautiful to behold from a distance but driving up close via the narrow switchback roads takes some nerve. And once you get to the parking lot, the rocky hike down is for only the most surefooted of beachgoers. On your way down, you'll likely meet some of the goats that populate the area. The narrow cove is flanked by steep rock walls that zig one way, then zag the other. When you reach the beach, you'll find yourself on one of the most beautiful spots on any coast—and a selfie here at Seitan Limania is hard to beat for bragging rights.

> 印度以其巨大的、人口稠密的城市而闻名，同时它也拥有看似无尽的海岸线。在西南海岸的果阿邦，你再也找不到比阿兰博尔更慵懒可爱的地方了。阿兰博尔是一个非常受欢迎的度假小镇，充满着沉睡渔村的氛围，其实这里曾经还真是一个渔村。如今，这里的热带气候、雨林山谷、历史建筑、沙滩、蔚蓝海水和摇曳的椰子树吸引着来自世界各地的游客，他们为阿兰博尔带来了新的活力。
> 
> 果阿邦与印度的大部分地区不同，因为这里曾是葡萄牙的殖民地，而当时印度其他地区是英国殖民地。葡萄牙帝国在16世纪初征服并开始统治果阿邦，直到1961年该地区被印度收复。你可以在果阿邦的天主教教堂和修道院中看到葡萄牙人对该地区的影响，该州最大城市是瓦斯科·达伽马，正是以曾经统治果阿邦的探险家的名字命名。
> 
> 如果你对历史不感兴趣，在太阳下山前的几个小时里，阿兰博尔还会举办非常出名的鼓圈活动和跳蚤市场。这个时候的阿兰博尔既是市场，又是海滩派对。手工艺人在这里出售手工制品，而音乐家则进行即兴表演。人们在沙滩、香料和阳光中结束在果阿完美的一天。

> Today we visit the Museu do Amanhã (Museum of Tomorrow) in Rio de Janeiro to celebrate 200 years of Brazilian independence. Designed by Spanish neofuturist architect Santiago Calatrava, the unique structure was commissioned to showcase Rio's revitalized waterfront ahead of the 2016 Olympics. The museum comprises five main areas: Cosmos, Earth, Anthropocene, Tomorrow, and Us, each inviting visitors to interact in different ways and learn about living in a sustainable world.
> 
> Brazil gained independence from Portugal just a few decades after the United States broke off from Great Britain, though it happened in a decidedly different way. Don Pedro I, first emperor of Brazil, was a member of the Portuguese ruling family (he would eventually briefly rule Portugal too). When Portugal threatened to take back the political autonomy Brazil had enjoyed since 1808, Pedro sided with his adopted homeland against the Portuguese. After a three-year war that was largely bloodless, the Empire of Brazil, which preceded the vibrantly diverse democracy we know today, was born on September 7, 1822.

> The first recorded expedition to successfully circumnavigate the Earth returned here to Seville, Spain, 500 years ago today. This was the remnants of the Spanish fleet that had set sail under the command of Ferdinand Magellan almost exactly three years previously with the goal of finding a western sea route to the rich Spice Islands of Indonesia. While Magellan gets the glory as leader of the expedition, he didn't actually complete the marathon voyage—he had been killed in a skirmish in the Philippines in April 1521. In the end, his place as leader of the five-ship voyage was filled by Juan Sebastián Elcano, whose command ship, the 'Vittoria,' was the only one in the convoy that survived the trip. Harsh conditions, starvation, scurvy, hostile encounters, and other struggles had taken their toll: Of the roughly 270 crew members who set out, only 18 returned with the expedition.
> 
> Although he made only half of this globe-circling journey, Magellan is rightly honored as an outstanding navigator, especially given the rudimentary knowledge of world geography and relatively primitive navigational tools of the time. He was the first European to traverse the strait that now bears his name near the tip of South America, trailblazing the first known passage between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The eventual success of Magellan's expedition, however bedraggled its remaining crew, also offered the first practical proof of a notion many 16th-century people were still skeptical about: The Earth is round.

> One of the greatest marvels of the marine world, the Belize Barrier Reef runs 190 miles along the Central American country's Caribbean coast. It's part of the larger Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System that stretches from Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula to Honduras and is the second-largest reef in the world behind the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996, the Belize Barrier Reef has remained relatively healthy even as many of the planet's reefs are threatened by climate change.
> 
> Featured here is a mangrove forest on Lighthouse Reef, one of three major atolls (above-water sections of reef that form ringlike, often lush island chains) in the reef system. It's the most visited of the atolls for one reason: Near its center is the Great Blue Hole, a marine sinkhole that's 1,043 feet across, 407 feet deep, and a bucket-list destination for serious scuba divers. Now protected within the Blue Hole Natural Monument, the hole was made famous when oceanographer Jacques Cousteau charted its depths in 1971.
> 
> The barrier reef is by far Belize's most popular tourist attraction, a destination for diving and fishing as well as sightseeing. An exceptionally diverse ecosystem, it includes more than 400 cays or islands, mangrove forests, coastal lagoons, estuaries, and coral atolls. Think of it as a taste of the South Pacific, but a lot closer to home.

> Many people in Asia celebrate the fall harvest season with the Mid-Autumn Festival—and since the moon is the, um, star of the show, it's also known as the Moon Festival. The holiday falls on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month each year and coincides with the full moon. Our photo features a moon installation from the festivities in Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia. The city is known for its colorful decorations and lively activities during the festival: Crowds flood the city to watch puppet shows, dragon dances, and parades lit by lanterns.
> 
> Of course, no festival is complete without food. Mooncakes are the most abundant treat at the Mid-Autumn Festival. These small, tasty pastries vary in style and flavor depending on the country where you're celebrating. Here in Kuala Lumpur, you can find traditional Chinese mooncakes but also unique local varieties, like some made with durian (a prickly tropical fruit known for both great flavor and ghastly smell) and cubilose (said to be delicious despite being made from dried bird spit).
> 
> But even if you're not keen to sample every kind of mooncake, you can come together with people of all races and creeds to celebrate Mid-Autumn. After all, the moon lights the way for us all.

> Today we're following our nose to the Pantanal in Brazil to visit this member of the toucan family named for the brownish plumage around its ears. What, you've never heard of a chestnut-eared aracari? That could be because aracaris don't really stand out among toucans at a glance: They have long, colorful bills, and they mate for life, always laying eggs in the same nest year after year. But aracaris are much more social nesters: Up to six aracari adults and all their babies might live in one nest.
> 
> Toucans are found in tropical climates in Central and South America, mainly in rainforests—our chestnut-eared friend tends to live in the southern Amazon Basin. Known frugivores, or fruit eaters, toucans have also been spotted eating the occasional lizard or even rival bird. They tend to be friendly with humans and have been successfully kept as pets—but probably prefer the wild life.

> We're kicking off Hispanic Heritage Month with this beautiful mural celebrating the contributions made to the Buffalo, New York, region by the Hispanic and Latinx communities. Artist, community activist, and educator Betsy Casañas, with the assistance of many local artists, created this mural called 'Homeland, Perhaps It Is Because I Wish to See You Fly, That My Flight Continues to Be Yours.' Its subjects highlight local cultural heritage, including portrayals of agricultural production and industrial work. Through conversations with members of the community, Casañas incorporated symbolism inspired by the mixed and integrated Latinx community of Buffalo.
> 
> Hispanic Heritage Month, a celebration of Hispanic and Latinx contributions to the United States, takes place each year from September 15 to October 15. Why doesn't it start at the beginning of the month? Because September 15 and 16 are important dates for many Hispanic communities in the Americas. On September 15, 1821, five Central American nations (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua) declared their independence from Spain, almost 11 years to the day (September 16, 1810) after Mexico had declared its independence. These countries were specifically mentioned when US President Lyndon Johnson proclaimed the enactment of what was then Hispanic Heritage Week. In the 1980s, the week became a month, and Belize (which had declared independence from the UK on September 21, 1981) was added to the list of celebrated nations.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Odds are this very focused puma has its eyes locked on a guanaco, a relative of the llama that's firmly at the top of its daily menu. In this case, dinner will be served in Torres del Paine National Park in the Patagonia region of Chile, the sprawling park recognized as one of the most famous places in the world to watch and photograph wild pumas. While tourists will sometimes see the big cats on their own, trained guides take visitors on hikes or all-terrain vehicle tours to look for the stealthy pumas. The wild cats have been officially protected for the last few years, bolstering their population, and there are abundant guanacos in the Patagonian steppes, which also helps.
> 
> The puma (which is the same big cat you might call a mountain lion or cougar) is the fourth-largest cat in the world, following the lion, tiger, and jaguar. Pumas don't roar like their large cousins—instead, they purr like house cats. That might explain why people in Patagonia simply call pumas gatos ('cats' in Spanish). With their characteristic slim build and impressive camouflage coloring, these canny hunters can live 10 years in their remote Patagonian home.

<summary>Description</summary>

> One of the most photographed places in Japan is this otherworldly grove of towering bamboo. The Arashiyama Bamboo Grove on the outskirts of Kyoto is surrounded by temples and shrines along the Katsura River. Rising as a manicured oasis of stories-high bamboo, the grove seems to turn the world green. The former villas and temples of the old noble class are located near the Arashiyama Grove, and its single 500-yard path is usually filled with visitors wielding cameras and selfie sticks, making this serene view a rare one.
> 
> World Bamboo Day, celebrated September 18, was created in 2009 to bring attention to this useful and versatile plant that flourishes in East Asia. Though the tallest bamboo can grow up to 100 feet, bamboo is not a tree but a grass. Known for its light weight, strength, and rapid growth, bamboo can be used to make almost anything, from clothing to building materials—and its shoots can even be consumed as food. Because it grows as much as 3 feet in a day, it's a highly renewable resource. For the same reason, it's also an invasive species in some places, as a small stand of bamboo can quickly become a large one. While bamboo grows best in tropical and warm climates, it adapts well to cool temperatures and high altitudes. And though it might have the most cultural value in Asia, it grows wild in Africa, the Americas, and Australia, too. Could there be bamboo growing near you?

> Britain bids farewell to Queen Elizabeth II today, as her state funeral takes place in London's historic Westminster Abbey. Crowds are lining the streets to pay their final respects to the queen, who died peacefully at her Scottish residence, Balmoral, at age 96 on September 8, after more than 70 years on the throne. The royal family, world leaders, and senior UK politicians are attending the funeral, which is being broadcast across the world. After the service, the queen will be laid to rest in St. George's Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle, alongside Prince Philip, her beloved husband of 73 years, whom she described as her "strength and stay."
> 
> Queen Elizabeth II is Britain's longest-reigning monarch, and she dedicated her life to public service through turbulent times in the nation and beyond. From jubilees and celebrations to tragedy and political upheaval, she remained a constant, steady force, balancing duty and family responsibilities in her role as the country's head of state.
> 
> While Britons are sharing their loss and memories of the queen, some see it as a time to question the very existence of the monarchy, wishing to break with their colonial past by removing the British monarch as head of state and becoming a republic. All eyes are on her son King Charles III as he begins his reign, wondering whether he will follow closely in his mother's footsteps or forge a royal path of his own.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Officially called Enhydra lutris, and unofficially known as the cutest creatures that float, these sea otters in Sitka Sound, Alaska, are doing what otters do, showing us that it truly does take a village, in this case a flotilla. Groups of either males or females (sometimes with pups), are appropriately named rafts. Male rafts tend to be larger and can number more than 1,000 individuals. Sea otters' buoyant bodies indeed work like literal rafts, standing in as cradles, dinner tables, or any kind of solid surface. That's handy because otters spend the vast majority of their lives in the water, even giving birth in the sea. Although they seem to live carefree lives, frolicking and grooming and diving, they also serve an important role in keeping their aquatic ecosystems healthy, something to remember this week as we mark Sea Otter Awareness Week, observed every year during the last week of September.
> 
> Otters keep the giant kelp forests of the Pacific Ocean healthy by eating sea urchins, which would otherwise decimate kelp, an important habitat for many fish and other sea creatures. Otters also eat crabs, shellfish, squid, and other invertebrates. They've learned to crack the shells of some of their shellfish prey by smashing the crustaceans and mollusks against a rock (fetched from the sea floor of course) lodged on their bellies. An otter's caloric needs are huge. It must eat a quarter of its body weight each day to keep up with its cold-water metabolism.
> 
> The key to an otter's aquatic lifestyle is its fur, the thickest of any mammal, with about 1 million hairs per square inch, so dense its skin never actually gets wet. Otters need all those gazillion hairs to stay warm as they don't have a layer of blubber like other marine mammals. Their luxuriant coats made them favorite targets for 18th- and 19th-century trappers who hunted otters to near extinction before they were protected by law. Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today we're marking the International Day of Peace, first commemorated in 1981, when the United Nations dedicated the day to 'strengthening the ideals of peace, through observing 24 hours of nonviolence and ceasefire.' This year's theme is 'End racism, build peace.' As the UN says, 'Achieving true peace entails much more than laying down arms. It requires the building of societies where all members feel that they can flourish. It involves creating a world in which people are treated equally, regardless of their race.'
> 
> Our photo today shows a striking symbolic artwork that seems as if it were commissioned to commemorate the International Day of Peace. Thousands of hands helped create 'Peace Doves,' an artwork installation from 2021 by sculptor Peter Walker that pulled together children and community groups in Liverpool, England. People wrote personal messages of peace on 18,000 paper doves, then those birds joined a dramatic heavenward flight of doves suspended on 15.5 miles of ribbon from the ceiling of Liverpool Cathedral. The lighting drew the focus to the powerful art installation, and if you stood inside the canopy of doves, you could look up and see where the strings of birds converged into starry points of light. Composer David Harper's musical soundscape added yet another layer to the artwork, which people flocked to—60,000 visitors marveled at the 'Peace Doves' in the first month. The main impressions noted? 'Beautiful' and 'moving.'

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> If you're lucky enough to see this view through the lens of your diving mask, you must be snorkeling in Jellyfish Lake on the island of Eil Malk in the Pacific island nation of Palau. Golden jellyfish are a subspecies unique to this small lake, on this small island—they're found nowhere else on the planet. Millions of teacup-sized golden jellies inhabit the lake, following the sunlight that nourishes them. Symbiotic algae live inside the jellyfish and provide their hosts with energy as a byproduct of photosynthesis. The more sun the jellies get, the more energy they derive from their hitchhikers. The jellies start the day at the east end of the lake and drift westward until dusk, following the arc of the sun.
> 
> The saltwater marine lake they live in is one of dozens in the Rock Islands, which Eil Malk is part of. The Rock Islands, declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2012, is a scattering of hundreds of very small, mostly unpopulated limestone islands and islets characterized by their mushroom-like shapes. On Eil Malk, Jellyfish Lake appears to be landlocked, but it's connected to the ocean by three shallow tunnels that bring water into and out of the lake with the tides. Nevertheless, the lake is so isolated from the nearby lagoon that the golden jellies evolved in this micro universe mostly cut off from other food sources and predators. As a result, they've lost their ability to sting. So, if you take a dip—snorkeling is allowed, but not scuba diving—there's no need to keep a polite distance.

National Public Lands Day is observed on the fourth Saturday in September, and today's also part of the Acadia Night Sky Festival, which celebrates the starlit skies over Maine's gem of a national park.
> 
> It's easy to take our national parks for granted. We certainly appreciate them and enjoy visiting, but today's commemoration reminds us that they also need our help. National Public Lands Day turns the spotlight on parks and other public lands, inviting everyone to explore but also to volunteer to plant trees, work on trail-maintenance projects, and more. As a bonus: Admission is free today at national parks, monuments, and other participating federal sites.

> Acadia is one of the smallest of the nation's 63 national parks, but it's attracted an impressive 4 million visitors annually in recent years. Aside from its natural beauty, Acadia has some of the most spectacular star-filled night skies in the eastern United States. The natural darkness is protected, with restrictions on outdoor lighting in the park and surrounding areas. The Acadia Night Sky Festival, which started on September 21 and continues through tomorrow, celebrates the natural darkness and the celestial star show. A favorite way to mark the occasion is by kayaking in Castine Harbor, where bioluminescent phytoplankton illuminate the water with a swirling, unearthly glow. With sparkling waters below and out-of-this-world stargazing above, it's been called Acadia's 'Floating Planetarium.'

> It's that time of year when Alaskan caribou are beginning to feel a little frisky. From late September until early November, males will be strutting their stuff, locking antlers with one another, and competing for the attention of females in hopes of furthering the species. Successful males will mate with 15-20 females a season. After the rutting season males will shed their antlers while females keep theirs until spring. In today's photo we're looking at some caribou in southcentral Alaska crossing the Susitna River.
> 
> Alaska has 32 distinct caribou herds. It's likely today's caribou are members of the Nelchina herd, which roams across about 20,000 square miles in the high basin surrounded by the Talkeetna, Chugach, Wrangell, and Alaska ranges. The Nelchina herd is among the most studied and recognized of Alaskan caribou partly because their range is relatively close to the major human population centers of the state. The herd has provided food for Alaskans for hundreds of years and its population is maintained through carefully monitored hunting regulations. But caribou populations can fluctuate from one year to the next depending on the availability of food and severity of the weather.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The highest concentration of geysers in the world is found here in this corner of Yellowstone National Park, called the Upper Geyser Basin. They include what is perhaps the most famous geyser of them all: Old Faithful. But the Upper Basin contains many other geysers as well, including the tallest predictable geyser (Grand Geyser) and the most voluminous geyser (Giant Geyser). Yellowstone contains about 500 geysers, roughly two-thirds the number in the entire world.
> 
> Geysers are essentially a rare form of hot spring—a water-filled tube that extends thousands of feet into the Earth's crust, so deep it makes contact with molten rock called magma. The magma is so hot that the water boils, builds to an extreme pressure, then shoots into the air, emptying the tube. After some time, more groundwater seeps into the tube, filling it, and starting the process over again. That's why geysers erupt at somewhat regular intervals. The bigger the tube, the more water, and the longer the eruption. Yellowstone is one of the few places in the world where you can safely walk among so many geysers and superheated springs, and view them close up. Trails and boardwalks guide the way, making the Upper Geyser Basin one of the star attractions of this famous national park.

<summary>Description</summary>

> At one point in history, the United States had upwards of 14,000 wooden covered bridges. Most of them were built between 1825 and 1875 to cross a stream or river and were intended to withstand the elements. An uncovered wooden bridge may have a life span of only about 20 years while a covered bridge could stand for more than 100. Even still, they don't fare well without upkeep and restoration costs can be high. That's why iron replaced wood as the preferred bridge-building material in the mid-1800s. These days, fewer than 900 of the original wooden covered bridges are believed to still be standing. The A. M. Foster Bridge, seen in today's photo, can be found in Cabot, Vermont.

> Named after Alonzo Merrill Foster, the inventor of a type of spout for collecting maple tree sap to be made into syrup, the bridge is located on Spaulding Farm. Don't be deceived—the Foster Bridge is actually a 1990s replica of a 'farm bridge' that was built in 1890 and known as the Orton Bridge. Despite being a replica, the Foster Bridge was authentically constructed by hand, in collaboration with Foster's great-grandson, with spruce lumber and salvaged granite. Spanning 45 feet across a pond and literally bridging the gap between two farms, it took less than six weeks to complete. Unfortunately, the bridge was found to be too narrow for modern farm equipment, a miscalculation that its constructors found amusing. Still, it works well as a photo opportunity and frequent venue for weddings.
