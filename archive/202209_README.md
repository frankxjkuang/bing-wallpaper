<summary>Description</summary>

> This idyllic road is a path to one of Italy's magnificent natural gifts. Just outside of the ancient city of Pisa in Tuscany is the Regional Park of Migliarino, San Rossore, Massaciuccoli. This immense and diverse park boasts numerous distinct environments. A visitor will discover, by turns, seaside sand dunes, marshlands, and vast forests of pine, oak, and elm. A wide array of birds can also be found in the park, along with ample wild boar, rabbits, red foxes, and the impressively antlered fallow deer. It's even been suggested that there are wolves living in the deep reaches of the woods.
> 
> While the park is popular for its beaches, forests, and wildlife, it offers cultural attractions as well. There are Roman ruins to be explored here, along with working farms, and environmental education opportunities. It's also home to the Villa del Gombo, once an official residence of the president of Italy. The villa was built in the 1950s on the site of a ruined old hunting lodge once owned by the Royal House of Savoy. Today the facility hosts conferences and tourists.

> In shallow areas of the tropical Indo-Pacific, you'll come across the blue linckia sea star. Oftentimes it's found anchored to or hiding under rocks. This duo was spotted near the coast of New Ireland, an island in Papua New Guinea. Even though 'blue' is in the name, this species of sea star has also been observed in purple, pink, or orange. The vibrant colors make the linckia popular in the seashell trade, unfortunately, and intensive poaching has diminished their populations. But new research could lead to calls for their protection: Scientists have studied potential anti-tumor and antibacterial properties inherent to the blue linckia.

<summary>Description</summary>

> It's not just chickens that cross the road. Wild creatures from frogs to elk roll the dice with death when they need to traverse the thousands of highways humans have threaded through wildlife habitat. Sadly, the dice don't fall favorably for millions of animals each year, and collisions with vehicles often cause fatalities for both them and the drivers who hit them.
> 
> Many countries now construct wildlife crossings—also called green bridges, ecoducts, natuurbrugs (like this one in Wierden in the Netherlands), and écoponts (in France). These can be either overpasses or underpasses, and they are an expensive venture. Are they worth it? Well, officials in Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada, would say categorically yes. Over 20 years they built 44 bridges and underpasses so wildlife could cross the Trans-Canada Highway, which divides the park; traffic accidents involving wildlife dropped by 80%.
> 
> France built the first overland wildlife crossings in the 1950s and continues to invest in many elaborate safe passageways. But the Netherlands leads the initiative, with an impressive 600-plus wildlife crossings, and counting. In fact, the Dutch can claim the honors for the world's longest animal crossing too—the Natuurbrug Zanderij Crailoo is an overpass that's half a mile long and 55 yards wide. Now chickens and their four-legged friends can cross the road anytime, no questions asked.
