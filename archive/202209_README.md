<summary>Description</summary>

> This idyllic road is a path to one of Italy's magnificent natural gifts. Just outside of the ancient city of Pisa in Tuscany is the Regional Park of Migliarino, San Rossore, Massaciuccoli. This immense and diverse park boasts numerous distinct environments. A visitor will discover, by turns, seaside sand dunes, marshlands, and vast forests of pine, oak, and elm. A wide array of birds can also be found in the park, along with ample wild boar, rabbits, red foxes, and the impressively antlered fallow deer. It's even been suggested that there are wolves living in the deep reaches of the woods.
> 
> While the park is popular for its beaches, forests, and wildlife, it offers cultural attractions as well. There are Roman ruins to be explored here, along with working farms, and environmental education opportunities. It's also home to the Villa del Gombo, once an official residence of the president of Italy. The villa was built in the 1950s on the site of a ruined old hunting lodge once owned by the Royal House of Savoy. Today the facility hosts conferences and tourists.

> In shallow areas of the tropical Indo-Pacific, you'll come across the blue linckia sea star. Oftentimes it's found anchored to or hiding under rocks. This duo was spotted near the coast of New Ireland, an island in Papua New Guinea. Even though 'blue' is in the name, this species of sea star has also been observed in purple, pink, or orange. The vibrant colors make the linckia popular in the seashell trade, unfortunately, and intensive poaching has diminished their populations. But new research could lead to calls for their protection: Scientists have studied potential anti-tumor and antibacterial properties inherent to the blue linckia.

<summary>Description</summary>

> It's not just chickens that cross the road. Wild creatures from frogs to elk roll the dice with death when they need to traverse the thousands of highways humans have threaded through wildlife habitat. Sadly, the dice don't fall favorably for millions of animals each year, and collisions with vehicles often cause fatalities for both them and the drivers who hit them.
> 
> Many countries now construct wildlife crossings—also called green bridges, ecoducts, natuurbrugs (like this one in Wierden in the Netherlands), and écoponts (in France). These can be either overpasses or underpasses, and they are an expensive venture. Are they worth it? Well, officials in Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada, would say categorically yes. Over 20 years they built 44 bridges and underpasses so wildlife could cross the Trans-Canada Highway, which divides the park; traffic accidents involving wildlife dropped by 80%.
> 
> France built the first overland wildlife crossings in the 1950s and continues to invest in many elaborate safe passageways. But the Netherlands leads the initiative, with an impressive 600-plus wildlife crossings, and counting. In fact, the Dutch can claim the honors for the world's longest animal crossing too—the Natuurbrug Zanderij Crailoo is an overpass that's half a mile long and 55 yards wide. Now chickens and their four-legged friends can cross the road anytime, no questions asked.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Crete is the largest and most populous of all the Greek islands, and also the farthest from the mainland (in fact, it's just about halfway to Turkey). This big little island is small enough to drive across in a few hours but full of wonders, from mountain ranges to gorges to beautiful beaches. Take this jewel box of turquoise water near the port city of Chania, for example. Set on the easternmost of three peninsulas that stick out like horns from the northwest shoreline of Crete, Seitan Limania is one of the most photographed beaches on the island.
> 
> Seitan Limania is beautiful to behold from a distance but driving up close via the narrow switchback roads takes some nerve. And once you get to the parking lot, the rocky hike down is for only the most surefooted of beachgoers. On your way down, you'll likely meet some of the goats that populate the area. The narrow cove is flanked by steep rock walls that zig one way, then zag the other. When you reach the beach, you'll find yourself on one of the most beautiful spots on any coast—and a selfie here at Seitan Limania is hard to beat for bragging rights.

> 印度以其巨大的、人口稠密的城市而闻名，同时它也拥有看似无尽的海岸线。在西南海岸的果阿邦，你再也找不到比阿兰博尔更慵懒可爱的地方了。阿兰博尔是一个非常受欢迎的度假小镇，充满着沉睡渔村的氛围，其实这里曾经还真是一个渔村。如今，这里的热带气候、雨林山谷、历史建筑、沙滩、蔚蓝海水和摇曳的椰子树吸引着来自世界各地的游客，他们为阿兰博尔带来了新的活力。
> 
> 果阿邦与印度的大部分地区不同，因为这里曾是葡萄牙的殖民地，而当时印度其他地区是英国殖民地。葡萄牙帝国在16世纪初征服并开始统治果阿邦，直到1961年该地区被印度收复。你可以在果阿邦的天主教教堂和修道院中看到葡萄牙人对该地区的影响，该州最大城市是瓦斯科·达伽马，正是以曾经统治果阿邦的探险家的名字命名。
> 
> 如果你对历史不感兴趣，在太阳下山前的几个小时里，阿兰博尔还会举办非常出名的鼓圈活动和跳蚤市场。这个时候的阿兰博尔既是市场，又是海滩派对。手工艺人在这里出售手工制品，而音乐家则进行即兴表演。人们在沙滩、香料和阳光中结束在果阿完美的一天。

Designed by Spanish neofuturist architect Santiago Calatrava, the unique structure was commissioned to showcase Rio's revitalized waterfront ahead of the 2016 Olympics. The museum comprises five main areas: Cosmos, Earth, Anthropocene, Tomorrow, and Us, each inviting visitors to interact in different ways and learn about living in a sustainable world.
> 
> Brazil gained independence from Portugal just a few decades after the United States broke off from Great Britain, though it happened in a decidedly different way. Don Pedro I, first emperor of Brazil, was a member of the Portuguese ruling family (he would eventually briefly rule Portugal too). When Portugal threatened to take back the political autonomy Brazil had enjoyed since 1808, Pedro sided with his adopted homeland against the Portuguese. After a three-year war that was largely bloodless, the Empire of Brazil, which preceded the vibrantly diverse democracy we know today, was born on September 7, 1822.

> The first recorded expedition to successfully circumnavigate the Earth returned here to Seville, Spain, 500 years ago today. This was the remnants of the Spanish fleet that had set sail under the command of Ferdinand Magellan almost exactly three years previously with the goal of finding a western sea route to the rich Spice Islands of Indonesia. While Magellan gets the glory as leader of the expedition, he didn't actually complete the marathon voyage—he had been killed in a skirmish in the Philippines in April 1521. In the end, his place as leader of the five-ship voyage was filled by Juan Sebastián Elcano, whose command ship, the 'Vittoria,' was the only one in the convoy that survived the trip. Harsh conditions, starvation, scurvy, hostile encounters, and other struggles had taken their toll: Of the roughly 270 crew members who set out, only 18 returned with the expedition.
> 
> Although he made only half of this globe-circling journey, Magellan is rightly honored as an outstanding navigator, especially given the rudimentary knowledge of world geography and relatively primitive navigational tools of the time. He was the first European to traverse the strait that now bears his name near the tip of South America, trailblazing the first known passage between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The eventual success of Magellan's expedition, however bedraggled its remaining crew, also offered the first practical proof of a notion many 16th-century people were still skeptical about: The Earth is round.

It's part of the larger Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System that stretches from Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula to Honduras and is the second-largest reef in the world behind the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996, the Belize Barrier Reef has remained relatively healthy even as many of the planet's reefs are threatened by climate change.
> 
> Featured here is a mangrove forest on Lighthouse Reef, one of three major atolls (above-water sections of reef that form ringlike, often lush island chains) in the reef system. It's the most visited of the atolls for one reason: Near its center is the Great Blue Hole, a marine sinkhole that's 1,043 feet across, 407 feet deep, and a bucket-list destination for serious scuba divers. Now protected within the Blue Hole Natural Monument, the hole was made famous when oceanographer Jacques Cousteau charted its depths in 1971.
> 
> The barrier reef is by far Belize's most popular tourist attraction, a destination for diving and fishing as well as sightseeing. An exceptionally diverse ecosystem, it includes more than 400 cays or islands, mangrove forests, coastal lagoons, estuaries, and coral atolls. Think of it as a taste of the South Pacific, but a lot closer to home.

The holiday falls on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month each year and coincides with the full moon. Our photo features a moon installation from the festivities in Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia. The city is known for its colorful decorations and lively activities during the festival: Crowds flood the city to watch puppet shows, dragon dances, and parades lit by lanterns.

> Of course, no festival is complete without food. Mooncakes are the most abundant treat at the Mid-Autumn Festival. These small, tasty pastries vary in style and flavor depending on the country where you're celebrating. Here in Kuala Lumpur, you can find traditional Chinese mooncakes but also unique local varieties, like some made with durian (a prickly tropical fruit known for both great flavor and ghastly smell) and cubilose (said to be delicious despite being made from dried bird spit).

> Today we're following our nose to the Pantanal in Brazil to visit this member of the toucan family named for the brownish plumage around its ears. What, you've never heard of a chestnut-eared aracari? That could be because aracaris don't really stand out among toucans at a glance: They have long, colorful bills, and they mate for life, always laying eggs in the same nest year after year. But aracaris are much more social nesters: Up to six aracari adults and all their babies might live in one nest.
> 
> Toucans are found in tropical climates in Central and South America, mainly in rainforests—our chestnut-eared friend tends to live in the southern Amazon Basin. Known frugivores, or fruit eaters, toucans have also been spotted eating the occasional lizard or even rival bird. They tend to be friendly with humans and have been successfully kept as pets—but probably prefer the wild life.

> Today we celebrate the birthday of Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve, which boasts 750-foot (and higher) sand dunes that cover more than 30 square miles. But the towering hills of sand—the tallest in North America—are just one feature of an eye-popping Colorado landscape that includes conifer forests, alpine lakes, and wetlands. The 150,000-acre park and preserve even encompasses stretches of tundra at the higher elevations, where it edges up against the base of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.
> 
> Initially proclaimed a national monument in 1932 by President Herbert Hoover, the territory was redesignated as Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve on September 13, 2004, and the size of the park was quadrupled. The protected landscape provides ample opportunities for visitors to enjoy a wide range of activities, from sandboarding and sand sledding down the steep dunes to hiking, camping, horseback riding, and fat-tire biking.

> 如此美景在前，让人惊叹不已。这是罗兰豁口，位于上比利牛斯省的加瓦尔尼冰斗，豁口的那头流淌着星光灿烂的银河。这个豁口是天然形成的，宽40米，深70米，深受徒步旅行者的欢迎。它位于海拔2807米的地方，扮演着山口的角色，也标示着西班牙和法国之间的边界。
> 
> 根据传说，这个豁口是查理曼大帝的侄子罗兰造成的，当时他试图用剑击打岩石来摧毁剑。
> 
> 加瓦尔尼冰斗是法国比利牛斯山脉最吸引人的景点之一，于1997年被联合国教科文组织列为了世界遗产。

<summary>Description</summary>

> We're kicking off Hispanic Heritage Month with this beautiful mural celebrating the contributions made to the Buffalo, New York, region by the Hispanic and Latinx communities. Artist, community activist, and educator Betsy Casañas, with the assistance of many local artists, created this mural called 'Homeland, Perhaps It Is Because I Wish to See You Fly, That My Flight Continues to Be Yours.' Its subjects highlight local cultural heritage, including portrayals of agricultural production and industrial work. Through conversations with members of the community, Casañas incorporated symbolism inspired by the mixed and integrated Latinx community of Buffalo.

> Hispanic Heritage Month, a celebration of Hispanic and Latinx contributions to the United States, takes place each year from September 15 to October 15. Why doesn't it start at the beginning of the month? Because September 15 and 16 are important dates for many Hispanic communities in the Americas. On September 15, 1821, five Central American nations (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua) declared their independence from Spain, almost 11 years to the day (September 16, 1810) after Mexico had declared its independence. These countries were specifically mentioned when US President Lyndon Johnson proclaimed the enactment of what was then Hispanic Heritage Week. In the 1980s, the week became a month, and Belize (which had declared independence from the UK on September 21, 1981) was added to the list of celebrated nations.

> Odds are this very focused puma has its eyes locked on a guanaco, a relative of the llama that's firmly at the top of its daily menu. In this case, dinner will be served in Torres del Paine National Park in the Patagonia region of Chile, the sprawling park recognized as one of the most famous places in the world to watch and photograph wild pumas. While tourists will sometimes see the big cats on their own, trained guides take visitors on hikes or all-terrain vehicle tours to look for the stealthy pumas. The wild cats have been officially protected for the last few years, bolstering their population, and there are abundant guanacos in the Patagonian steppes, which also helps.
> 
> The puma (which is the same big cat you might call a mountain lion or cougar) is the fourth-largest cat in the world, following the lion, tiger, and jaguar. Pumas don't roar like their large cousins—instead, they purr like house cats. That might explain why people in Patagonia simply call pumas gatos ('cats' in Spanish). With their characteristic slim build and impressive camouflage coloring, these canny hunters can live 10 years in their remote Patagonian home.
