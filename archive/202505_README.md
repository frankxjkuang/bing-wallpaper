> Today, while the world celebrates May Day with parades and protests, Hawaii takes a more fragrant approach—by draping itself in flowers. On May 1, Hawaii celebrates Lei Day, a tradition that honors culture, craftsmanship, and the ever-present aloha spirit, described as 'the coordination of mind and heart within each person.' Since 1928, this Hawaiian tradition has been in full bloom, with leis—or garlands made of flowers, leaves, or shells—serving as symbols of connection. The idea for Lei Day came from poet Don Blanding, who suggested a holiday dedicated to Hawaii's iconic floral garlands. Local writer Grace Tower Warren gave it its slogan, 'May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii,' and the tradition quickly took root.
> 
> What started as a single event in Honolulu has grown into a statewide celebration, with each island showcasing its unique floral identity, such as Maui's pink lokelani rose and the Big Island's red 'ōhi'a lehua. Giving a lei is a gesture of aloha, and on this day, that warmth can be seen everywhere. Whether crafted from fragrant Plumeria flowers, like the ones pictured here, delicate pikake, or colorful ti leaves, leis symbolize the bonds between people and the land. So, if you find yourself in Hawaii on May 1, don't just say 'Aloha'—wear it.

> In the lush Pantanal wetlands of Brazil, a striated heron perches on a Victoria water lily. This water bird, also known as the mangrove heron, is about 16 inches tall. It is a master of patience, waiting to ambush its prey. It uses clever tactics, such as dropping feathers or insects to lure fish. Common in the wetlands of South America, the striated heron is also found in North America, Australia, Africa, Asia, New Guinea, and the Pacific islands.
> 
> The Victoria, or giant water lily, belongs to the genus of aquatic herbs, including species like Victoria amazonica and Victoria boliviana, which can boast leaves up to 10 feet in diameter. The Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetland, is a sanctuary for wildlife and offers an extraordinary glimpse into the natural world.

> On May 4, 'Star Wars' fans celebrate Star Wars Day, a tribute to the beloved franchise created by George Lucas. The film series consists of nine movies, collectively referred to as the 'Skywalker Saga.' One of the memorable filming locations is Plaza de España in Seville, Spain, as seen in today's image. This beautiful square, with its semi-elliptical shape and stunning architecture, was used as the city of Theed on the planet Naboo. The scene where Senator Amidala arrives in Naboo, featuring Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen, was filmed here. Plaza de España's unique design, with its central building, towers, and fountain, adds a touch of magic to the Star Wars universe. This historic square, designed by Aníbal González, was originally built for the Ibero-American Exposition in 1929.

> Cinco de Mayo, or the Fifth of May, marks the Mexican army's victory over France at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. While it is only celebrated sporadically in Mexico, it has become a vibrant celebration of Mexican culture and heritage in the US, especially in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston. This holiday is often mistaken for Mexican Independence Day, but that falls on September 16. Instead, Cinco de Mayo honors Mexico's fight against foreign rule and symbolizes resilience and unity. The battle itself was brief, lasting from daybreak to early evening, but the Mexican army, led by General Ignacio Zaragoza, managed to defeat a much larger and better-equipped French force. Today, Cinco de Mayo festivities feature parades, mariachi music, folk dancing, and delicious foods like tacos and mole poblano. Whether you're joining a festival or just enjoying a plate of Mexican cuisine, it's a great day to appreciate Mexico's rich history and traditions. Viva Mexico!

> Imagine soaring through the skies in an ultralight aircraft, the wind rushing past as you take in the picturesque views. Below, the world's oldest desert, the Namib, stretches endlessly, shaped by winds over 55 million years. This is Namibia—a surreal landscape of towering dunes, dry riverbeds, and shifting sands.
> 
> Unlike traditional aircraft, ultralights offer an unmatched sense of freedom. Also known as microlights, these small planes are designed for low-altitude, slow-speed flying. Their weight and speed limits vary by country; in the United States, they should weigh under 254 pounds when empty and not go over 55 knots (63 miles per hour) at full power. With open or semi-enclosed cockpits, ultralights provide breathtaking panoramic views, making each flight an immersive experience. Ultralight aviation emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s, revolutionizing recreational flying. With minimal regulations and lightweight design, these aircraft offer an accessible and exhilarating way to explore some of the world's most remote and beautiful places, like the one we see in today's image.

<summary>Description</summary>

> If Dunluce Castle, pictured here, feels like something straight out of 'Game of Thrones,' that's because it is the real-life inspiration for Pyke, the seat of House Greyjoy. Built in the 13th century, this castle in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, was once a stronghold of the MacDonnells of Antrim, a branch of the Clan MacDonnell that played a key role in Irish politics from the 15th to the 17th century. The family's fortunes declined after the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, and with little money for upkeep, the castle gradually fell into ruin.
> 
> Dunluce Castle is steeped in legend, including the tale of its banshee. Maeve Roe, the only daughter of Lord MacQuillan, defied an arranged marriage and was locked away in the castle's turret. One night, as Maeve Roe and her lover fled by boat, a fierce storm struck, dragging them both to a watery grave. Locals say her ghostly cries still echo from the turret. Today, visitors can explore the windswept remains of this medieval fortress, imagining the feasts and battles that once took place here. And if the castle itself isn't impressive enough, the views over the Causeway Coast certainly are.

> One moment they're blending in, the next they're flaunting a new shade—chameleons really know how to color the world. But every May 9, these masters of disguise can't hide from the spotlight. International Chameleon Day celebrates their color-shifting skills, zippy tongues, and wild adaptations. Chameleons change colors to help regulate their body temperature, attract mates, and communicate with others. Specialized skin cells, including iridophores, reflect light to create dazzling displays. Some species turn bright to signal aggression, while others adopt subdued tones to avoid attention.

> A chameleon's eyes move independently, scanning for predators or prey. With 360-degree vision and a lightning-fast sticky tongue, they're stealthy hunters and agile escape artists. Their zygodactylous feet (two toes forward, two toes back) and prehensile tails give them an iron grip, making them expert climbers in tricky treetops. So, today, whether you stand out or fade in, take a moment to appreciate these incredible creatures.

> A grand and gilded sight—the heart of the Minnesota State Capitol is waiting to be explored. Home to the Minnesota Senate, the House of Representatives, the governor's office, and the attorney general's office, this building also houses a chamber for the Minnesota Supreme Court. Designed in the Beaux-Arts and American Renaissance styles, the Capitol integrates modern materials like iron, glass, and steel. The term 'Beaux-Arts' was not used when the Capitol was built, but the style gained popularity, partly due to the architecture showcased at the 1893 Chicago World's Columbian Exposition. Architect Cass Gilbert's design features a remarkable dome, which is inspired by St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican City. Featured in today's image, it is the second-largest self-supported marble dome in the world.
> 
> This dome is built in three layers, each serving a different purpose. The outermost layer, made of Georgia marble, holds itself up by sheer weight alone. Inside, a brick-and-steel cone adds support and helps drain water to withstand Minnesota's harsh winters. The innermost layer is the beautifully decorated dome visible from the rotunda. Resting at its base, twelve marble eagles stand alongside the surrounding columns. Crowning the structure is an elegant stone lantern, topped with a gleaming gold-leaf-covered finial globe.

Just as the last sakura (cherry blossom) petals drift away, Tokyo's gardens start gearing up for their next big show: the iris bloom. Featured here is an iris garden in Tokyo. The iris is a flowering plant genus that has 310 recognized species, known for their bold and beautiful blossoms. The genus is named after the Greek word 'îris', meaning 'rainbow,' which is also the name of the Greek goddess of rainbows.
> 
> During the Edo Period (1603-1867), a fascination with breeding Japanese irises led to an explosion of new varieties. Today, there are over 2,000 types, which are planted in March and nurtured by tsuyu, Japan's rainy season. These vibrant flowers make their grand entrance in early June, marking the start of summer. Three beautiful iris species flourish in the country's gardens and wild landscapes: hanashōbu (Iris ensata), kakitsubata (Iris laevigata), and ayame (Iris sanguinea). Iris ensata is known as 'Japanese iris' outside Japan. With flowers this stunning, who wouldn't want to take a stroll through this floral paradise?

> Wildlife roams freely in one of Chile's most stunning protected areas, where towering peaks and ancient glaciers shape the land. Established on this day in 1959, Torres del Paine National Park in Patagonia turns 66 years old today and covers over 448,000 acres. Originally called Grey Lake National Tourism Park, it was renamed in 1970 and later designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1978. Its most recognizable feature—the three massive granite peaks known as the Torres—stands over 8,000 feet tall. These formations took shape through magma intrusion and uplift, followed by millions of years of glacial erosion, leaving behind the jagged spires seen today.
> 
> The park's lakes and rivers, fueled by melting ice, create a hydrological network that sustains its wildlife. Four major glaciers—Tyndall, Grey, Dickson, and Zapata—are fed by the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. Originating from Dickson Lake, the Paine River flows through various bodies of water, including Paine Lake, Nordenskjöld Lake, and Pehoé Lake. Wildlife thrives here, including pumas, endangered southern huemuls (south Andean deer), Chilean flamingos, and chimango caracaras. With grasslands, wetlands, and forests, the park supports a range of plant life, including lenga and Antarctic beech, and cushion plants that endure the harsh climate.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Most ports rely on docks and cranes that extend into the shoreline. Porto Flavia on the Italian island of Sardinia took a completely different approach. This engineering marvel transformed a cliff into a gateway for Sardinia's ore industry. Mining in the area has a history dating back thousands of years, from the Phoenicians and Romans to the industrial boom in the 20th century. Lead, zinc, coal, sulfur, barium, and silver were extracted from these rugged hills, but transporting them was a logistical nightmare. Ore had to be hauled by cart, loaded onto small boats, and then transferred to larger ships—a slow, costly, and inefficient process.
> 
> In 1924, Italian engineer Cesare Vecelli revolutionized ore transport in the region. He designed Porto Flavia as a system of tunnels and silos carved into a limestone cliff, allowing ore to be loaded directly onto cargo ships. The facility featured two stacked tunnel levels. The upper level could store up to 11,000 short tons of ore in nine reservoirs. Gravity-fed chutes transported the ore to the lower level, where a conveyor belt loaded it directly onto waiting ships. The port, named after Vecelli's daughter, Flavia, remained in use until mining declined in the mid-20th century. Today, visitors can explore its tunnels, massive silos, and the platform where ships once docked—soaking in the same sea breeze that once carried Sardinia's minerals to markets worldwide.
