> Today, while the world celebrates May Day with parades and protests, Hawaii takes a more fragrant approach—by draping itself in flowers. On May 1, Hawaii celebrates Lei Day, a tradition that honors culture, craftsmanship, and the ever-present aloha spirit, described as 'the coordination of mind and heart within each person.' Since 1928, this Hawaiian tradition has been in full bloom, with leis—or garlands made of flowers, leaves, or shells—serving as symbols of connection. The idea for Lei Day came from poet Don Blanding, who suggested a holiday dedicated to Hawaii's iconic floral garlands. Local writer Grace Tower Warren gave it its slogan, 'May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii,' and the tradition quickly took root.
> 
> What started as a single event in Honolulu has grown into a statewide celebration, with each island showcasing its unique floral identity, such as Maui's pink lokelani rose and the Big Island's red 'ōhi'a lehua. Giving a lei is a gesture of aloha, and on this day, that warmth can be seen everywhere. Whether crafted from fragrant Plumeria flowers, like the ones pictured here, delicate pikake, or colorful ti leaves, leis symbolize the bonds between people and the land. So, if you find yourself in Hawaii on May 1, don't just say 'Aloha'—wear it.

> In the lush Pantanal wetlands of Brazil, a striated heron perches on a Victoria water lily. This water bird, also known as the mangrove heron, is about 16 inches tall. It is a master of patience, waiting to ambush its prey. It uses clever tactics, such as dropping feathers or insects to lure fish. Common in the wetlands of South America, the striated heron is also found in North America, Australia, Africa, Asia, New Guinea, and the Pacific islands.
> 
> The Victoria, or giant water lily, belongs to the genus of aquatic herbs, including species like Victoria amazonica and Victoria boliviana, which can boast leaves up to 10 feet in diameter. The Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetland, is a sanctuary for wildlife and offers an extraordinary glimpse into the natural world.

> On May 4, 'Star Wars' fans celebrate Star Wars Day, a tribute to the beloved franchise created by George Lucas. The film series consists of nine movies, collectively referred to as the 'Skywalker Saga.' One of the memorable filming locations is Plaza de España in Seville, Spain, as seen in today's image. This beautiful square, with its semi-elliptical shape and stunning architecture, was used as the city of Theed on the planet Naboo. The scene where Senator Amidala arrives in Naboo, featuring Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen, was filmed here. Plaza de España's unique design, with its central building, towers, and fountain, adds a touch of magic to the Star Wars universe. This historic square, designed by Aníbal González, was originally built for the Ibero-American Exposition in 1929.

> Cinco de Mayo, or the Fifth of May, marks the Mexican army's victory over France at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. While it is only celebrated sporadically in Mexico, it has become a vibrant celebration of Mexican culture and heritage in the US, especially in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston. This holiday is often mistaken for Mexican Independence Day, but that falls on September 16. Instead, Cinco de Mayo honors Mexico's fight against foreign rule and symbolizes resilience and unity. The battle itself was brief, lasting from daybreak to early evening, but the Mexican army, led by General Ignacio Zaragoza, managed to defeat a much larger and better-equipped French force. Today, Cinco de Mayo festivities feature parades, mariachi music, folk dancing, and delicious foods like tacos and mole poblano. Whether you're joining a festival or just enjoying a plate of Mexican cuisine, it's a great day to appreciate Mexico's rich history and traditions. Viva Mexico!

> Imagine soaring through the skies in an ultralight aircraft, the wind rushing past as you take in the picturesque views. Below, the world's oldest desert, the Namib, stretches endlessly, shaped by winds over 55 million years. This is Namibia—a surreal landscape of towering dunes, dry riverbeds, and shifting sands.
> 
> Unlike traditional aircraft, ultralights offer an unmatched sense of freedom. Also known as microlights, these small planes are designed for low-altitude, slow-speed flying. Their weight and speed limits vary by country; in the United States, they should weigh under 254 pounds when empty and not go over 55 knots (63 miles per hour) at full power. With open or semi-enclosed cockpits, ultralights provide breathtaking panoramic views, making each flight an immersive experience. Ultralight aviation emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s, revolutionizing recreational flying. With minimal regulations and lightweight design, these aircraft offer an accessible and exhilarating way to explore some of the world's most remote and beautiful places, like the one we see in today's image.
