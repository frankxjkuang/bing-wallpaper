> Today, while the world celebrates May Day with parades and protests, Hawaii takes a more fragrant approach—by draping itself in flowers. On May 1, Hawaii celebrates Lei Day, a tradition that honors culture, craftsmanship, and the ever-present aloha spirit, described as 'the coordination of mind and heart within each person.' Since 1928, this Hawaiian tradition has been in full bloom, with leis—or garlands made of flowers, leaves, or shells—serving as symbols of connection. The idea for Lei Day came from poet Don Blanding, who suggested a holiday dedicated to Hawaii's iconic floral garlands. Local writer Grace Tower Warren gave it its slogan, 'May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii,' and the tradition quickly took root.

> What started as a single event in Honolulu has grown into a statewide celebration, with each island showcasing its unique floral identity, such as Maui's pink lokelani rose and the Big Island's red 'ōhi'a lehua. Giving a lei is a gesture of aloha, and on this day, that warmth can be seen everywhere. Whether crafted from fragrant Plumeria flowers, like the ones pictured here, delicate pikake, or colorful ti leaves, leis symbolize the bonds between people and the land. So, if you find yourself in Hawaii on May 1, don't just say 'Aloha'—wear it.
