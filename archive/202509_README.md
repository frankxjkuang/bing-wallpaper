> May 1915: Chicago buzzes with energy. Streetcars pass brick buildings, shop signs catch the morning light, and the city moves with purpose. But today, something different takes over the streets. The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, just months old, march in rows as sharp as the suits they craft. This isn't a quiet debut—it's a statement.
> 
> Formed by tailors and factory workers who broke away from more cautious unions, the Amalgamated brought together recent immigrants, skilled hands, and people tired of 14-hour shifts. In this parade, they're not behind machines—they're out front, holding banners high and showing what collective strength looks like.
> 
> Labor Day became a national holiday in 1894, but by 1915, it was still evolving—part celebration, part protest. Originally created to honor workers' contributions amid demands for fair wages, safer conditions, and shorter workdays, today, it's marked by barbecues, marches, sales, and one last summer break. It's a pause in the calendar that reminds us why time off matters—and a nod to those who keep the country moving.

<summary>Description</summary>

> The Wilderness Act of 1964, passed 61 years ago today, established the legal definition of wilderness in the United States. Its purpose was to preserve areas 'where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man.' This landmark legislation created the National Wilderness Preservation System, protecting millions of acres from development, roads, and mechanized use.
> 
> Among the most iconic areas protected under this act is the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in northeastern Minnesota. Spanning over one million acres, it is a vast expanse of interconnected lakes, rivers, and boreal forests. The landscape is a mosaic of glacially carved waterways, rocky outcrops, and dense woodlands, offering a haven for moose, wolves, loons, and countless other species. With over 1,200 miles of canoe routes and more than 2,000 campsites, it provides a rare opportunity for solitude and immersion in nature. The Wilderness Act laid the foundation for safeguarding places like the Boundary Waters, ensuring they remain wild and untouched for future generations to experience and cherish.

> It's time to go wild—responsibly! Today is National Wildlife Day. Let's celebrate the incredible animals that roam, fly, swim, and slither across our planet. It's also a day to honor the work of wildlife sanctuaries, conservationists, and endangered species programs that protect our most vulnerable creatures.
> 
> Among the most iconic of these is the grizzly bear, a symbol of the American wilderness. Young grizzlies like these cubs in Alaska's Katmai National Park often 'play-fight' to build strength, sharpen skills, and establish social bonds. These heavyweight champs can weigh up to 900 pounds and still sprint faster than most humans (up to 35 mph). Once widespread across the western United States, grizzlies now primarily roam Alaska and parts of the Northern Rockies. National Wildlife Day reminds us that keeping their wild spaces safe is key to their survival—and ours. So today, let's honor the wild, protect what's precious, and maybe growl a little in solidarity.

> When the sun clocks out in streaks of orange, pink, and purple, Santa Monica goes from laid-back to lit up. Literally. With over 3 miles of sand, a historic pier, and the Pacific Coast Highway keeping things scenic, this beach is more than just a pretty shoreline. Let's start with the sand. Wide, clean, and ready for volleyball or just flopping down with a good book, it's ideal for sunbathers and sandcastle architects alike. And yes, 'Baywatch' was filmed along Santa Monica Bay. Feel free to run in slow motion.
> 
> Then there's the Santa Monica Pier. Built in 1909 and still standing tall on wooden legs, it's got an amusement park called Pacific Park, arcade, restaurants, and that famous solar-powered Ferris wheel. Up for more movement? The Marvin Braude Bike Trail, or the Strand, is a 22-mile bike path that zips right through the beach. Rent a cruiser and ride past rollerbladers, dog walkers, and tourists trying to juggle ice cream and selfies. Here, the surf is another draw. Beginners can catch their first wave here, while pros keep an eye on the swells farther out.

> They fly backward, dive-bomb rivals, and travel farther than most road trippers. On National Hummingbird Day, meet the rufous hummingbird—photographed in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, California. The bird, one of nine species in the genus Selasphorus, gets its name from its rusty, reddish-orange feathers. Males flash copper backs and red throat patches that shimmer in the sun. Females are more subdued but still carry streaks of rufous on their sides and tails.
> 
> They may look sweet, but these pollinators are known for their aggressive behavior, often chasing away not just other hummingbirds, but also bees and butterflies. At around 3 inches long, this nectar-seeker is a frequent flyer in the most literal sense. Each year, it migrates from Mexico to Alaska and back—a round-trip of up to 8,000 miles. That's one of the longest migrations relative to body size in the bird world. And here's the kicker: many return to the exact same gardens and feeders year after year.
> 
> Whether you're planting flowers, or peering through binoculars as one zips by, National Hummingbird Day is a good excuse to slow down and marvel at something tiny but mighty.

> Where cobbled charm meets coastal cool, Gdańsk is a dynamic city in Poland's Pomorskie province. It is part of Tricity—a metropolitan area along the Gdańsk Bay that includes the neighboring coastal cities of Sopot and Gdynia, along with nearby towns. The city likely takes its name from 'Gdania,' an earlier name for the Motława river that runs through it.
> 
> The city originated as a Slavic fort in the late 10th century and was first recorded in 997, when it came under the early influence of the Polish state. Over the centuries, Gdańsk has experienced Polish, German, and independent rule, each leaving a mark on the region's identity. The Main City draws most visitors, especially to the lively promenade that runs along Ulica Długa (Long Street) and Długi Targ (Long Market). Flanked by decorative gates and lined with stately townhouses rebuilt in 17th-century style, this pedestrian stretch is steeped in charm. Once the ceremonial path for Polish royalty, it's now fondly known as the Royal Route. The path unfolds like a living museum, dotted with historic landmarks like the Highland Gate, Amber Museum, Uphagen's House, Main Town Hall, Neptune's Fountain, and the grand Artus Court.

> Read it and believe it—literacy changes everything. As a basic human right, literacy is a powerful tool that opens the door to greater freedoms and active global citizenship. Recognizing its far-reaching impact, International Literacy Day—observed each year on September 8 since 1967—serves as a reminder of how vital literacy is in building a better, more sustainable future for all. This year, the theme explores literacy in a digital age, where technology continues to reshape how people learn, communicate, and participate in society. As a result, digital engagement has become both a challenge and an opportunity.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Quick, clever, and always on the move—meet the Eurasian red squirrel, a leafy treetop resident found across much of Europe and Asia. While it prefers the shelter of forests, this agile creature easily adapts to gardens and parks. It builds its nest, called a drey, high in the fork of a tree using twigs to form a domed structure about 10 to 12 inches wide. The female featured here is gathering moss—one of several soft materials, along with bark, leaves, and grass, that line the nest and turn it into a snug, well-insulated retreat. These rodents may also take over tree hollows or abandoned woodpecker holes when available.
> 
> Typically solitary and quite shy, they rarely share food or space. However, during colder months, it's not uncommon for several individuals to use the same nest to stay warm. Their social organization is shaped by dominance hierarchies, both within and between the sexes. While males aren't always dominant over females, the top-ranking individuals tend to be older and larger. Dominant males also tend to occupy larger home ranges than subordinate males or most females.

<summary>Description</summary>

> 'Make hay while the sun shines' may sound like an old proverb, but in farming it's a practical truth. Hay baling plays a crucial role in agriculture worldwide. It involves cutting, drying, and packaging grasses to feed livestock during the colder months. The process depends heavily on the weather: the grass must be dry before it's baled, or it risks molding. Farmers must act quickly once a dry spell arrives, making it a seasonal race.
> 
> The practice of baling dates back centuries, evolving from horse-powered balers of the 1800s to today's high-powered machines that can wrap and eject bales in minutes. In North Yorkshire, England—where today's image was taken—the rolling lowlands and upland meadows create ideal conditions for growing and curing high-quality hay. With grazing livestock such as sheep and cattle making up around 40% of farm holdings, hay is a key feed resource supporting the region's rural economy. So, when you see golden fields dotted with neat, sunlit rolls, you're witnessing the result of careful timing and hard work. It's a tradition that remains as important today as ever.

Nearly 3,000 innocent lives were lost in the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and aboard United Airlines Flight 93. Today, on Patriot Day, we honor the fallen and the countless acts of courage that emerged in the face of tragedy, from firefighters and first responders to ordinary citizens who became heroes. At 8:46 AM Eastern Time—the moment the first plane struck the North Tower—Americans observe a moment of silence. Permanent memorials now stand at each of the three sites. Visiting one or volunteering in your community is a meaningful way to participate in the National Day of Service and honor those who continue to serve.

> With lifelong bonds, signature whistles, and echolocation, dolphins are more than just smart swimmers. First observed in 2022, World Dolphin Day shines a light on these intelligent marine mammals and the oceans they rely on. The day encourages people to learn about their behavior and the threats they face. Over 40 dolphin species swim our seas, from the Māui dolphin to the Irrawaddy dolphin. They're expert navigators, problem-solvers, and team players. Some even form superpods—temporary gatherings of hundreds or thousands of dolphins moving together offshore.
> 
> Off the coast of Marsa Alam in Egypt, pods of spinner dolphins glide through the warm waters of the Red Sea—as seen in today's image. True to their name, they can leap and spin in the air up to seven times in a single jump. Found in tropical waters across the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans, they rest during the day in calm bays and hunt offshore at night. But their predictable routines have left them vulnerable to unregulated tourism. Some conservation zones now limit visitor access to allow dolphins to rest undisturbed. The hope? That these creatures continue their spins without interruption.

Drive just over an hour north of San Francisco, and you'll reach Point Reyes National Seashore—a place where fog drifts slowly, tule elk roam freely, and time seems to pause. Established by Congress on this day in 1962, the park was set aside to protect this piece of coastline for public enjoyment and environmental conservation. It covers over 100 square miles and features an impressive array of landscapes, from coastal prairie and blustery headlands to sandy shores and Douglas fir woodlands.

> At the park's eastern boundary, Chimney Rock—seen in today's image—extends into the Pacific Ocean with towering cliffs and sweeping sea views. Its trail is considered one of the best spots on the West Coast to witness the gray whale migration. In the winter months, nearby secluded beaches become a refuge for northern elephant seals, offering an opportunity for wildlife viewing. With over 490 species of birds, more than 80 types of mammals, and numerous rare plants, Point Reyes ranks among the most ecologically diverse places in the country. Over 150 miles of trails invite visitors to slow their pace and immerse themselves in the surroundings.

> What's as colorful as the diversity and history of humankind? The Latino Cultural Center in Dallas, Texas. Its vibrant walls—seen in today's image—rise from a 27,000-square-foot foundation and celebrate Latino and Hispanic arts and culture. From September 15 to October 15, our country observes Hispanic Heritage Month, honoring the histories, cultures, and contributions of Americans with roots in Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central and South America.
> 
> One of the most dynamic places to experience this celebration is the Latino Cultural Center. Designed by renowned Mexican architect Ricardo Legorreta, the center is a bold landmark that blends modern design with traditional Mexican aesthetics. Since its opening in 2003, the venue has hosted over 300 events annually, including art exhibitions, theater performances, and community workshops. During Hispanic Heritage Month, it becomes a lively hub, showcasing local Latino artists, folkloric dance, and cultural storytelling. Notable exhibitions have featured artists including Celia Álvarez Muñoz, Judy Baca, Margaret Garcia, and Benito Huerta. Whether you're attending a performance or admiring its architecture, the Latino Cultural Center stands as a powerful tribute to the enduring influence of Hispanic culture in American life.

> What do invisible gases, vintage hairspray, and satellites have in common? They all played a role in one of the greatest environmental comebacks in history. Seen from 225 miles above, the Gulf Coast glows like a constellation—clusters of light scattered across the dark. But what truly makes this view possible can't be seen: the ozone layer, silently shielding everything below from the sun's ultraviolet rays. By the 1980s, that shield was thinning fast—damaged by chemicals once used in refrigeration and aerosol products. The solution? A global pact. The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, led to a swift phase-out of ozone-depleting substances. Today, satellites show that the hole over Antarctica is shrinking. Scientists believe it could be fully healed by mid-century.
> 
> On September 16, we mark the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer—a celebration of science, global cooperation, and collective will. It's a reminder that no molecule is too small to have a massive impact. But it's proof, too, that with the right action, even invisible damage can be undone.

> He may be young, but these antlers speak of future battles. In Denali National Park, Alaska, a young bull moose lifts his head above the shrubs. At this stage, his antlers are more crown than weapon—still covered in velvet. But even now, they hint at a life shaped by instinct, sparring, and the quiet pull of dominance.
> 
> Moose are the largest members of the deer family in North America, and mature bulls can top 1,500 pounds and reach nearly 7 feet at the shoulder. Their antlers grow at an astonishing pace—up to an inch a day in summer—only to be shed every winter, then regrown each spring. This young bull might not be ready to duel for territory or mates just yet, but rehearsal has already begun. He'll spar gently with others, learning how to move, how to hold his ground, how to rise in the ranks of the wild. Spotting moose in Denali is fairly common, but finding one mid-growth is something else entirely: a glimpse into the making of a giant. For now, there's no clash—just the quiet power of potential beneath Alaska's endless sky.

> This stunning view—where the sky meets the open waters of the Atlantic—is accessible only by foot. Tucked away on Ireland's wild and beautiful Dingle Peninsula, Dunquin Pier is one of the most photogenic spots in County Kerry. The small pier is famous for its winding, serpentine path that zigzags dramatically down the cliffside like a ribbon. These steep curves aren't just for the thrill—they're the only way to reach the pier below, where boats depart for the remote Blasket Islands.
> 
> The nearby village of Dunquin (Dún Chaoin in Irish) is Ireland's westernmost settlement, offering sweeping views and a deep connection to Irish heritage. With a population of just over 100, Dunquin is known for its strong Gaelic traditions, storytelling, and ties to the Blasket Island writers. Visitors often stop at the Blasket Centre, a cultural museum that tells the story of island life and emigration. Whether you're drawn by the dramatic landscape or the rich cultural heritage, Dunquin offers a uniquely Irish experience that feels both timeless and unforgettable.

> When you hear 'Thousand Islands,' you might think of a jar of salad dressing, but the namesake of that creamy condiment is one of North America's most enchanting regions. The Thousand Islands form an archipelago in the St. Lawrence River, spanning the state of New York and the province of Ontario. It is made up of more than 1,800 islands. Some of these islands have fairytale castles; others are barely big enough for a hammock. There's also Just Room Enough Island, which lives up to its name with a single house and a lone tree.
> 
> The Thousand Islands are perfect for slow-paced exploration. Boat tours take you past grand estates and historic lighthouses, often stopping at landmarks like Boldt Castle and Singer Castle. Kayakers are drawn to the region's clear waters and serene coves. Thanks to a unique microclimate, local winemakers craft award-winning wines that are well worth sampling. Oh, and the salad dressing? Legend says a local fishing guide's wife first created it for dinner guests, including actress May Irwin, who enjoyed it so much that she asked for the recipe. The rest, as they say, is delicious history.

> Every fall, Theresienwiese, a square in Munich, Germany, transforms into one of the world's largest festivals—Oktoberfest. First held in 1810 to celebrate a royal wedding, it has grown into a 16- to 18-day tradition attracting more than 6 million people from around the globe. The scale is staggering: The festival grounds span about 4.5 million square feet and host 14 main tents, each seating thousands. Each year, visitors consume around 7 million liters of beer, along with mountains of pretzels, sausages, and gingerbread hearts. All beer served at Oktoberfest comes from Munich breweries and meets the strict standards of the Reinheitsgebot, the German Beer Purity Law.
> 
> Beyond the drinks and food, the sprawling fairground is its own world, filled with roller coasters, games, and classic rides. Among them, the Wellenflug, the swing carousel pictured here, offers sweeping views of the festival grounds and the Munich skyline. This year, the festival begins today and runs through October 5. Whether you come for the beer, the pretzels, or the thrill of dangling your feet high above the city, Oktoberfest has a seat waiting for you.

> Think sea otters are just about whiskers and floating naps? There's more going on behind those button eyes. Every year, Sea Otter Awareness Week highlights their role in maintaining coastal ecosystems. Launched in 2003 by Defenders of Wildlife—a nonprofit conservation organization—this week promotes education and action. In Alaska's Prince William Sound, sea otters drift on ice or crack shellfish on their bellies using their favorite rock, as seen in today's image. Less visible is how their appetite for sea urchins helps protect kelp forests.
> 
> Often seen floating in 'rafts,' holding paws to stay connected, they appear serene—but their history tells a different story. Hunted extensively for their dense fur from 1741 to 1911, sea otters were pushed to the brink of extinction before rebounding through conservation. Still, dangers remain. Oil spills, fishing gear, disease, and warming oceans continue to threaten their survival. Otters rely on clean, cold water. Their fur isn't waterproof—it traps air for warmth, and any oil contamination can be fatal. This week serves as a call to notice them—and to protect the waters they call home.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Fall isn't just marked by the calendar. Each September, Earth's subtle tilt brings the autumn equinox—one of two times a year when day and night are nearly equal in length. It marks the beginning of fall in the Northern Hemisphere. From solar alignments to changing leaves, nature offers its own quiet signals that the season has shifted. While for most of us it may seem like just another day, ancient cultures paid close attention to this change. Sites like Chichén Itzá in Mexico and England's Stonehenge were designed to align with the rising or setting sun during equinox days.
> 
> One of the best places to catch the change in season? Fishlake National Forest in Utah. As September rolls in, the aspen trees seen in today's image begin their annual transformation, turning vivid shades of yellow that ripple across the hills. The forest covers more than 2,300 square miles of lakes, trails, and mountains that shine with fall color. There's something grounding about watching the season change in sync with something much older than the Gregorian calendar we follow.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Somewhere in the wide prairies of northeastern Wyoming stands Devils Tower, a stone formation that rises from the open plains. Once called Bear Lodge, the butte gained its current name during an 1875 expedition led by Colonel Richard Irving Dodge, possibly after an interpreter mistranslated a Native phrase as 'Bad God's Tower.' The missing apostrophe in its official title follows standard geographic naming conventions—hence, the signs read 'Devils Tower.' In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed it the nation's first national monument; a milestone whose anniversary falls today.
> 
> As you approach Devils Tower, every curve in the road unveils a new view—whether you're arriving from the highway, winding toward the visitor center, or following the Tower Trail on foot. The site's significance stretches far deeper than its dramatic geology. For centuries, numerous tribes from the Great Plains and Black Hills, including the Arapaho, Crow, and Cheyenne, have been linked to this place. Each tribe preserves oral traditions about the Tower's creation. While many of these accounts share recurring themes, the details remain unique to every community. Devils Tower continues to embody a living chronicle of geology, heritage, and the ever-changing relationship between humans and the natural world.

Their name comes from the Sanskrit 'rajaputra,' meaning 'son of a king,' and they are celebrated for their noble lineage and martial traditions across northern India. The fort's stone walls have witnessed centuries of courage, pride, and romance, remembered in the songs of Rajasthan's bards. According to legend, Bhim, a hero from the Hindu epic 'Mahabharata,' first laid its foundations.

> As one of the largest forts in India, Chittorgarh encompasses 65 historic structures, including four palaces, 19 large temples, 20 reservoirs, four memorials, and several victory towers. This fort has a circumference of about 8.1 miles and a maximum length of 3.1 miles. It is reached by a steep, zigzag ascent of just over half a mile from the plains, beginning with a limestone bridge over the Gambhiri River. Climbing this path and passing through its ancient gates, you can almost hear the echoes of battles and legends—inviting you to step into a living chapter of history.

With survival smarts and turbo-charged feet, this tiny rodent proves that being 'least' is no reason to squirrel away your potential. Weighing less than a deck of cards and measuring under 10 inches from nose to tail, this species is North America's smallest chipmunk.

> When it's not sprinting up logs or vanishing into leaf piles, it is stuffing its face—literally. Its expandable cheek pouches help it haul seeds, berries, and insects to storage spots. Come winter, it doesn't fully hibernate. Instead, it enters a light torpor, waking every so often for a snack. Not one for group living, each least chipmunk carves out its own territory every summer, usually with a hidden burrow and a backup food cache or ten. But if a predator wanders too close, you'll hear chip-chip-chip alarms sounding off.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Some towns evolve slowly over centuries. Pienza? It received a full rebrand in the 1400s from a pope who wanted to prove a point—and maybe show off a little. This tiny Italian town is perched above the Val d'Orcia, surrounded by rolling hills that look exactly like you think Tuscany should: cypress trees, winding dirt roads, the occasional sheep. It's peaceful. And then you step inside the town walls, and it gets clever.
> 
> Pienza was once a regular medieval village called Corsignano. That is, until one of its sons became Pope Pius II and decided to transform his hometown. He hired architect Bernardo Rossellino and rebuilt the area based on Renaissance ideals of symmetry, order, and harmony. The result? A site that feels intentional. The central square, Piazza Pio II, is flanked by a cathedral, a papal palace, and a town hall, all arranged just so. Moreover, Pienza is known for pecorino cheese—sheep's milk, aged in interesting ways. And once a year, the whole town turns into a cheese arena for Fiera del Cacio, a festival featuring Cacio al Fuso—a game where people roll wheels of cheese at a target.
