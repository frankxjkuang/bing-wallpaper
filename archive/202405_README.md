> 随着太阳缓缓升起，夏威夷迎来了五月的第一天。伴随着五颜六色的鲜花、迷人的香氛，花环节在一片欢声笑语中拉开了序幕。夏威夷花环是由各种花朵、叶子甚至贝壳制成的，对于岛上的原住民而言，这些花环承载着重要的文化意义。在很久以前，波利尼西亚人向东迁徙，穿过太平洋群岛，然后在公元1000年至1200年抵达夏威夷岛，为当地的原住民带来了代表爱、尊重和无处不在的“阿洛哈精神”的夏威夷花环。阿洛哈（aloha）是夏威夷原住民的问候语，意为“你好”，它代表着夏威夷岛民平和的生活态度，是一种强调个人思想与心灵协调的精神。花环节全天都有庆祝活动，包括游行、露天表演、花环制作比赛、草裙舞和美食盛宴。

> 在夏威夷文化中，夏威夷花环还代表了文化的多样性，花环节也标志着亚裔美国人和太平洋岛民传统文化月的开始，人们会在这一天纪念亚太裔群体对美国的贡献。

> As the first day of May dawns in Hawaii, Lei Day bursts forth in a riot of color, fragrance, and festivity. Leis are garlands crafted from flowers, leaves, and even shells, carrying significant cultural importance in Hawaiian culture. Leis were brought by the Polynesians as they migrated eastward through the Pacific Islands before reaching Hawaii between 1000 and 1200 CE. They represent love, respect, and the ever-present aloha spirit, described as 'the coordination of mind and heart within each person.' Lei Day is an all-day fiesta that includes parades, pageants, lei-making contests, hula dances, and feasts. It also marks the beginning of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to the Sonoran Desert, where life thrives despite the heat thanks to two seasons of rainfall. This subtropical desert spreads across parts of Mexico, California, and Arizona and is home to animals such as roadrunners, Gila monsters, and the Morafka's desert tortoise. Its rainy seasons are followed by the blossoming of colorful wildflowers such as the brittlebush, seen in today's image. These hardy shrubs are adapted to the dry seasons, with their silvery-gray leaves covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Brittlebushes produce bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding splashes of color to the desert landscape. Another drought-loving desert flora is the saguaro cactus, which can live for over 150 years and grow up to 40 feet tall. The saguaro also provides food and shelter for desert species and is a sacred plant in the culture of the Tohono O'odham people.

> May the Force be with you on May 4, adopted by 'Star Wars' fans as the day to celebrate their favorite franchise. Many will recognize Skellig Michael, the island on our homepage, as the location of scenes from the 'Star Wars' sequels, 'The Force Awakens' and 'The Last Jedi.' This UNESCO World Heritage Site appears in the movies as the planet Ahch-To, where Jedi master Luke Skywalker seeks refuge. Home to a 6th-century monastery with beehive huts and stone staircases, it also hosts a large seabird population that inspired the penguin-like porgs that roost on Ahch-To. Skellig Michael is about 7 miles off Ireland's southwestern coast, daily visitors are limited, and boat trips are canceled if it is too stormy. Still, the island attracts 'Star Wars' fans and others keen to see this ancient site, not so very far, far away.

Not to be confused with Mexico's Independence Day, Cinco de Mayo instead marks Mexico’s 1862 triumph over France at the Battle of Puebla. The holiday is observed in Mexico but has become popular in the US since the 1980s thanks to various advertising campaigns.

> In today's image, the sun encroaches on the Roaches, a rocky ridge in the Peak District, northern England. Its strange name comes from the French 'les roches,' which means 'the rocks.' Rising to a height of over 1,600 feet, the ridge is a popular destination for climbers and hikers in the Peak District National Park. It offers stunning views over the moorland and, if you're lucky, you may spot a wallaby! A number of these Australian marsupials escaped from a nearby private zoo in the 1930s, and there are still recorded sightings of the descendants of the original wallabies.
> 
> The Roaches is a protected habitat for other animals too; its blanket bogs and upland moorlands are home to a range of birds, including curlews, red grouse, tree pipits, and peregrine falcons. A very different sort of creature is said to live at the top of the ridge. Local legend has it that Doxey Pool—a small pond—is home to a malevolent mermaid who tempts people into the water.

> Happy International Day of Light! Held on May 16, it marks the anniversary of the invention of the laser by the American physicist and engineer Theodore Maiman in 1960. This pioneering creation helped revolutionize fields from communications to health care and lasers are now found in everything from printers and barcode scanners to surgical devices. Today's event also celebrates light's presence in every aspect of human existence, from art and culture to science and technology.

> Today's image features 'Feelings Are Facts,' a collaborative installation by Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson and Beijing-based architect Ma Yansong. In 2010 it filled the Great Hall of the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing with illuminated fog. A grid of lights partitioned the haze into the primary colors of red, green, and blue, blending seamlessly at intersections to create transitional hues of cyan, magenta, and yellow. Gallery visitors relied solely on intersecting hues of colored fields to navigate the fog.

> Today, on Endangered Species Day, we unite in a collective effort for conservation. Currently, there are over 44,000 species that are threatened with extinction. Among the world's most endangered animals are Javan and black rhinos, mountain gorillas, and Hawksbill turtles.
> 
> Today, let us take you to the Tarangire National Park in Tanzania, where African elephants roam freely. These gentle giants are characterized by their large, flapping ears, long trunks, and curved tusks. They live in small family groups led by a matriarch and while they are known to noisily trumpet, they also communicate over distances through low-frequency sound waves. Unfortunately, threats like habitat loss and poaching have left them on the brink of extinction. Endangered Species Day highlights efforts to protect all endangered animal and plant species worldwide, big and small.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Perched on the rugged cliffs of the Italian Riviera, Vernazza is one of the five villages of the Cinque Terre area of northwestern Italy. Here, ancient buildings stand along the coastline of the Ligurian Sea, and life is filled with the hustle and bustle of the fishing industry. Vernazza got its name from the indigenous wine, 'vernaccia,' meaning 'local' or 'ours.' One of the best-known monuments in the area is the medieval Doria Castle, built as a defensive fortress to protect the village from frequent pirate attacks. Thanks to the construction of the Genoa–La Spezia rail line in the 19th century, the village became more accessible by land. The car-free cobblestone streets are ideal for walking around. While here, you might want to visit the Chapel of Santa Marta and the Sanctuary of Madonna di Reggio. Vernazza is sometimes described as the pearl of the Cinque Terre with its natural port, colorful houses, and green terraces overlooking a sparkling sea.

Bees come in a range of sizes, from just 0.08 inches all the way up to 2.5 inches, and there are over 20,000 known species. One of the most important pollinators, they help keep trees, flowers, and crops alive, helping to secure food chains as well as boosting biodiversity. It's no overstatement to say that bees are vital for humans' survival.

> Today we're celebrating the biodiversity of our planet. What exactly is biodiversity? It refers to the variety of living things, from animals and plants to fungi and microorganisms, in one area. This delicate but vigorous balance in nature is what keeps us all alive. That's definitely worth celebrating! May 22 was named International Day for Biological Diversity by the United Nations in 2000. Unfortunately, the biodiversity of Earth is slowly decreasing due to climate change, the draining of natural resources, urbanization, and pollution, among other factors. Campaigners are urging governments, businesses and individuals to take action to boost biodiversity, to protect healthy ecosystems that supply us with water, food, medicines, and more. After all, we are blessed with intriguing species such as the Tasmanian snow gum—the tree seen in today's image—that takes root in one of the most biologically diverse places on the planet, the Mount Field National Park in Tasmania, Australia.

The origins of this day date back to the 1860s, in the years following the Civil War and the first national observance was held in 1868. However, one of the earliest accounts is from October 1864, when three women in Boalsburg, Pennsylvania, placed flowers at the graves of two Union soldiers. They decided to decorate the graves of all the fallen soldiers and returned to do the same the following year.
