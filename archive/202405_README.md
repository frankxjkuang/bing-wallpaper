> 随着太阳缓缓升起，夏威夷迎来了五月的第一天。伴随着五颜六色的鲜花、迷人的香氛，花环节在一片欢声笑语中拉开了序幕。夏威夷花环是由各种花朵、叶子甚至贝壳制成的，对于岛上的原住民而言，这些花环承载着重要的文化意义。在很久以前，波利尼西亚人向东迁徙，穿过太平洋群岛，然后在公元1000年至1200年抵达夏威夷岛，为当地的原住民带来了代表爱、尊重和无处不在的“阿洛哈精神”的夏威夷花环。阿洛哈（aloha）是夏威夷原住民的问候语，意为“你好”，它代表着夏威夷岛民平和的生活态度，是一种强调个人思想与心灵协调的精神。花环节全天都有庆祝活动，包括游行、露天表演、花环制作比赛、草裙舞和美食盛宴。

> 在夏威夷文化中，夏威夷花环还代表了文化的多样性，花环节也标志着亚裔美国人和太平洋岛民传统文化月的开始，人们会在这一天纪念亚太裔群体对美国的贡献。

> As the first day of May dawns in Hawaii, Lei Day bursts forth in a riot of color, fragrance, and festivity. Leis are garlands crafted from flowers, leaves, and even shells, carrying significant cultural importance in Hawaiian culture. Leis were brought by the Polynesians as they migrated eastward through the Pacific Islands before reaching Hawaii between 1000 and 1200 CE. They represent love, respect, and the ever-present aloha spirit, described as 'the coordination of mind and heart within each person.' Lei Day is an all-day fiesta that includes parades, pageants, lei-making contests, hula dances, and feasts. It also marks the beginning of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to the Sonoran Desert, where life thrives despite the heat thanks to two seasons of rainfall. This subtropical desert spreads across parts of Mexico, California, and Arizona and is home to animals such as roadrunners, Gila monsters, and the Morafka's desert tortoise. Its rainy seasons are followed by the blossoming of colorful wildflowers such as the brittlebush, seen in today's image. These hardy shrubs are adapted to the dry seasons, with their silvery-gray leaves covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Brittlebushes produce bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding splashes of color to the desert landscape. Another drought-loving desert flora is the saguaro cactus, which can live for over 150 years and grow up to 40 feet tall. The saguaro also provides food and shelter for desert species and is a sacred plant in the culture of the Tohono O'odham people.

> May the Force be with you on May 4, adopted by 'Star Wars' fans as the day to celebrate their favorite franchise. Many will recognize Skellig Michael, the island on our homepage, as the location of scenes from the 'Star Wars' sequels, 'The Force Awakens' and 'The Last Jedi.' This UNESCO World Heritage Site appears in the movies as the planet Ahch-To, where Jedi master Luke Skywalker seeks refuge. Home to a 6th-century monastery with beehive huts and stone staircases, it also hosts a large seabird population that inspired the penguin-like porgs that roost on Ahch-To. Skellig Michael is about 7 miles off Ireland's southwestern coast, daily visitors are limited, and boat trips are canceled if it is too stormy. Still, the island attracts 'Star Wars' fans and others keen to see this ancient site, not so very far, far away.

Not to be confused with Mexico's Independence Day, Cinco de Mayo instead marks Mexico’s 1862 triumph over France at the Battle of Puebla. The holiday is observed in Mexico but has become popular in the US since the 1980s thanks to various advertising campaigns.

> In today's image, the sun encroaches on the Roaches, a rocky ridge in the Peak District, northern England. Its strange name comes from the French 'les roches,' which means 'the rocks.' Rising to a height of over 1,600 feet, the ridge is a popular destination for climbers and hikers in the Peak District National Park. It offers stunning views over the moorland and, if you're lucky, you may spot a wallaby! A number of these Australian marsupials escaped from a nearby private zoo in the 1930s, and there are still recorded sightings of the descendants of the original wallabies.
> 
> The Roaches is a protected habitat for other animals too; its blanket bogs and upland moorlands are home to a range of birds, including curlews, red grouse, tree pipits, and peregrine falcons. A very different sort of creature is said to live at the top of the ridge. Local legend has it that Doxey Pool—a small pond—is home to a malevolent mermaid who tempts people into the water.
