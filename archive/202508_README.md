> Every August, Edinburgh stops being just a city and starts acting up—literally. From pub basements to park benches, stages appear in the strangest places, and shows pop up on quiet streets. Welcome to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, or the Fringe. The story began in 1947, when eight theater groups turned up uninvited to the Edinburgh International Festival. They performed anyway. That spirit of rebellion stuck, and the Fringe was born.
> 
> Now it's the world's largest arts festival, with thousands of shows crammed into three action-packed weeks. Anyone can perform. If you have an idea and a venue, you're in. Even a shipping container counts—yes, that really happened. Comedy is the unofficial king of the festival, but there's also drama, dance, drag, musicals, magic, mime, spoken word, circus, and acts that defy all categories. One year, a man did an hour-long monologue from inside a fridge. Another year featured a full Shakespeare play in Klingon. Street performers flood the Royal Mile, pictured here, offering sneak peeks, juggling acts, and flyers.  The Edinburgh Festival Fringe is where experimental performances and high-end theater thrive. It has launched careers: think of artists like Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Eddie Izzard.

<summary>Description</summary>

> There's something timeless about Capitol Reef National Park—a place where red rock cliffs, winding canyons, and ancient stories come together under Utah's desert sky. Designated a national park in 1971, Capitol Reef invites reflection—not just on its vivid geology, but on the ancient narratives and cultural heritage etched into its landscape.
> 
> Long before visitors laced up hiking boots and hit the trails at Capitol Reef, the Fremont and Ancestral Puebloan peoples called this place home. Between 300 and 1300 CE, they lived in pit houses and natural rock shelters, weaving farming into their hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Their connection to the land was both spiritual and practical—and they left behind some of the park's most captivating features, including petroglyphs like those found in Fruita, featured in today's image. These rock panels showcase an ancient visual language, featuring human figures adorned with headdresses and jewelry. Alongside them are animals like bighorn sheep and lizards, as well as abstract shapes alluding to ceremonies, migrations, and celestial events. Together, they form a silent archive—a timeless record of the people who lived, moved, and made meaning in this extraordinary landscape.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Bright and bold, sunflowers are loved by bees, birds, and just about everyone. The name of their genus, helianthus, comes from the Greek words for sun (helios) and flower (anthos). These annual plants are known for their large, daisy-like flowers and radiant charm. While sunflowers come in shades of red, orange, and maroon, it's the classic yellow blooms with brown centers that are the most common.
> 
> Beyond their good looks, sunflowers are grown for their tasty seeds, which are snacked on, pressed for cooking oil, or offered as a treat for birds. Their value isn't a modern discovery—Native Americans cultivated them thousands of years ago. Sunflowers were often planted alongside corn, beans, and squash as a symbolic 'fourth sister,' reflecting their importance long before they became garden icons. The earliest evidence of domestication in the United States comes from Tennessee and dates back to around 2300 BCE. That long-standing legacy continues today, as sunflowers remain a staple in fields and backyards.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Silent hunters of the night sky, owls are among the most intriguing creatures in the animal kingdom. Their ability to turn their heads up to 270 degrees—combined with silent flight and exceptional night vision—showcases their remarkable adaptations. With over 200 species found across the globe, these birds contribute to ecological balance and are deeply woven into cultural traditions. Celebrated annually on August 4, International Owl Awareness Day not only honors their presence in nature but also raises awareness about the threats they face.
> 
> Featured here is a nesting pair of great gray owls. Known as the world's largest owl species by length, which ranges from 24 to 33 inches, they span the Northern Hemisphere and are found in both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. Unlike many birds, they don't build their own nests—instead, they repurpose those left behind by large raptors or settle into broken treetops and hollow trunks. Despite their size and status as apex predators, they are non-aggressive, rarely clashing with rivals or intruders. However, during the fledgling stage, the female fiercely protects her vulnerable and flightless young.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Not every science lesson requires a classroom. In La Jolla, California, tide pools teach you about ocean life—right at your feet. Along the rocky shoreline of this San Diego coastal neighborhood, tide pools form during low tide as seawater gets trapped in natural depressions. These shallow pools form naturally along La Jolla's rocky shorelines, especially near Windansea Beach, Shell Beach, South Casa Beach, and Hospital Point. The water that remains trapped in sandstone and reef depressions creates habitats for everything from sea hares to brittle stars. Over time, the tide pools are created through the process of erosion—waves hit the sandstone and limestone coastlines until they carve out pockets that hold water. Twice a day, as the tide moves in and out, these spaces flood and drain, challenging the survival skills of everything inside. Winter months, when tides are lowest during daylight hours, are ideal for observing them.

<summary>Description</summary>

> No road signs, no souvenir stands—just 11 miles of mud, cliffs, and sweeping views leading to one of Hawaii's most remote beaches. Kalalau Beach, at the end of Kauai's Kalalau Trail, is where tired feet meet a sandy reward. The only land access is the trail itself, a rugged trek through valleys and along coastal cliffs. During summer, some arrive by kayak, but all visitors need permits to stay.
> 
> Long before camping permits and composting toilets, this remote stretch supported generations of Native Hawaiians. Thanks to freshwater streams and fertile soil, early Hawaiians farmed taro (a root vegetable widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions) in stone terraces. Fishing, farming, and a deep spiritual connection to the land (āina) shaped daily life. Remnants of temples and house sites still lie hidden in the valley's folds. By the 1920s, most residents had left due to disease, Western contact, and shifting land use. In recent decades, off-the-grid seekers sought refuge here until state protections were implemented. Today, Kalalau is both sacred and scenic—a place where history lingers with every crashing wave.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Before GPS told ships where to go, lighthouses lit the way—each with its own flash pattern so sailors could figure out where they were, even in total darkness. It's National Lighthouse Day, a perfect excuse to give these coastal workhorses some credit. In 1789, Congress passed a law to make sure all lighthouses were taken care of by the federal government. Whether you're a history buff, coastal explorer, or just into old engineering, today is a great day to learn more about lighthouses or visit one with your friends and family.
> 
> Like many lighthouses around the world, Florida's Gasparilla Island Lights still hold their ground. The Gasparilla Island Rear Range Light, seen in today's image, has had quite a journey. Originally assembled in Delaware, it found its forever home here in 1927 but was decommissioned by the Coast Guard in 2014. The lighthouse was restored to its former glory in 2017 and was switched on again in 2018. Today, it blinks white every six seconds. Both lights are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The lighthouse grounds and museum are open to visitors seasonally, offering insights into the area's shipping past.

> With a roar that echoes across the plains, lions have long captured the human imagination. On August 10, World Lion Day invites us to celebrate these iconic big cats while raising awareness about their declining numbers and the urgent need for conservation.
> 
> One of the best places to witness lions in the wild is Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya. Nestled in the heart of East Africa, this vast savanna is home to around 850 to 900 lions. The reserve's rich ecosystem and seasonal wildebeest migration offer a front-row seat to the drama of lion life—from territorial battles to cooperative hunts. But Maasai Mara is more than a wildlife haven; it's a model for community-led conservation. Local Maasai communities work alongside conservationists to protect both lions and their ancestral lands, showing that coexistence is not only possible but powerful. On World Lion Day, let's honor these majestic animals by supporting efforts that ensure their survival—for the health of ecosystems and the heritage of future generations.

> Big ears, bigger hearts—elephants are more than just icons of the wild. Every year on August 12, we celebrate World Elephant Day—a global movement to raise awareness about the majestic giants that roam places like Amboseli National Park in Kenya, pictured here. What makes elephants so extraordinary isn't just their size; it's their minds. These animals have incredible memories. Matriarchs, the oldest females, can recall the locations of water sources from decades past, and they use that knowledge to lead their herds through tough times. Their social bonds run just as deep. Elephants live in close-knit families, mourn their dead, and have even been observed comforting one another during hard times.
> 
> But even in protected spaces like Amboseli, elephants face threats. Habitat loss, climate change, and the illegal ivory trade continue to take a toll. World Elephant Day is more than a celebration; it's a reminder that without our help, even these mighty animals could quietly disappear. So, as you admire this African elephant herd in the image today, remember: each elephant carries a lifetime of memories and a future worth fighting for.

Welcome to Corona Arch, seen in today's image, a towering Navajo sandstone formation that offers big adventure without the big crowds. The Corona Arch Trail starts off easy but packs a punch of scenery: railroad tracks, slickrock scrambles, and even a metal cable assist make it more than just a walk in the desert. After 1.5 miles of walking, the payoff is big: a massive arch that's 140 feet wide and 105 feet high. It's so large that people once swung from it on ropes, until that was banned for safety reasons. Even without the adrenaline stunts, the hike offers beautiful views and unforgettable moments in the heart of Red Rock Country. Also known as Little Rainbow Bridge, it shares visual similarities with the iconic Rainbow Bridge arch near Lake Powell—but Corona Arch holds its own in a more peaceful setting.

> It's a bird, it's a plane, it's … a fish! Gliding through the ocean with flapping fins and polka-dot flair, the spotted eagle ray refuses to blend in. It doesn't crawl along the seabed like its stingray cousins—it flies underwater. The species gets its name from—you guessed it—its protruding snout, which resembles an eagle's beak, and its distinctive spotted back, which is unique to each individual, much like fingerprints. Their wing-like pectoral fins can span up to 10 feet. Near the base of the long tail are venomous spines, in case a predator gets too close. These rays aren't aggressive, but they're not defenseless either.
> 
> These creatures are often seen alone, but when they travel in groups, it's a show worth watching. Dozens can glide together in perfect sync, like the ones photographed near San Cristóbal Island in Ecuador. They are also known to leap out of the water, sometimes completely clearing the surface, proving you don't need feathers to fly. Despite their elegance, spotted eagle rays are currently listed as near threatened. Their populations are declining due to various threats, including bycatch and habitat degradation.

> If you think bees are just out for a sting, think again. These tiny winged workers are running the world's sweetest gig—and they've got a whole day dedicated to their buzz-ness. Welcome to World Honey Bee Day, celebrated every third Saturday in August. About 35% of global food crop production relies on animal pollination, including honey bees. The value of crops pollinated by bees is estimated at hundreds of billions of dollars. Despite their superpowers, bees are in a sticky situation. Habitat loss, pesticides, disease, and climate change are making life in the hive less than ideal.
> 
> Today's image features a row of bright boxes in Italy—those are beehives. Bees use color to distinguish between hives, much like humans use house numbers. Blue, yellow, green, and red hives help reduce confusion and accidental hive invasions. On World Honey Bee Day, let's think outside the hive. Whether it's through colorful conservation, mindful eating, or planting for pollinators, there's always a way to 'bee' involved.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Built to brave storms and steer ships to safety, lighthouses now glow as symbols of heritage, wonder, and connection. Each year on the third weekend of August, the International Lighthouse Lightship Weekend brings together people from around the globe to celebrate these coastal icons. The event was launched in 1998 by John Forsyth and Mike Dalrymple of Scotland's Ayr Amateur Radio Group. It aims to raise awareness about preserving lighthouses and lightships while also promoting amateur radio and encouraging international goodwill.
> 
> Among the many lighthouses that carry this legacy forward is the Lyngvig Lighthouse in Denmark, featured here. Standing over 120 feet tall, this tower was built in 1906 atop a 55-foot dune along the west coast of Jutland—the country's westernmost region. Made with a concrete foundation and brick walls, and finished with teak-framed windows and doors, the lighthouse originally required a team of three keepers. They maintained its light until 1965. It has been operating automatically ever since. Following a temporary closure in 2024 due to structural concerns, the lighthouse is now open to the public again.

<summary>Description</summary>

> There's no easing into the wild here—the Avalanche Lake Trail carves a bold path through rock scrambles, narrow ledges, and alpine serenity. Tucked away in New York's Adirondack High Peaks, this 9-acre alpine lake sits at nearly 2,900 feet between Mount Colden and Avalanche Mountain. Shaped by ancient glaciers, the lake is framed by dramatic cliffs and rugged terrain that echo its icy origins. Its most striking feature is the Trap Dike—a towering 1,200-foot rock canyon flanked by steep walls, making the lake one of the most awe-inspiring sights in the Adirondacks. Massive avalanches carved these cliffs, leaving behind the dramatic landscape that gave Avalanche Lake its name. The Avalanche Lake Trail begins at the Adirondack Loj, a well-known launch point for adventures in the High Peaks. Spanning about 9.6 miles round trip with a 1,350-foot elevation gain, the hike may seem manageable on paper—but it's the uneven terrain that truly tests your mettle.

> Planes, progress, and a whole lot of sky. National Aviation Day gives us a reason to pause and appreciate how aviation has shaped the modern world—and the innovators who dared to dream of flight. The national day was established in 1939 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to honor Orville Wright's contributions to aviation. Wright, born on this day in 1871, achieved the first powered, controlled flight in 1903 along with his brother Wilbur. The day is recognized as an opportunity to promote the advancement of aviation through public events and educational activities. Many aviation museums offer free or discounted entry, and airfields often hold open houses to engage the community.
> 
> The Solar Impulse project is a remarkable milestone in modern aviation. In July 2010, the Solar Impulse prototype completed a 26-hour test flight powered only by the sun. It flew through the day and night without using fuel—a key step in proving solar-powered flight was possible. Building on this, Solar Impulse 2, seen in today's image, successfully completed the first solar-powered flight around the world from 2015 to 2016, covering over 26,000 miles without burning fossil fuels. These flights show how aviation can push forward into cleaner, more sustainable territory.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Set at Corsica's southern edge, Bonifacio looks out across a narrow strait to Sardinia, its limestone cliffs towering above the waves. Bonifacio didn't begin as a picturesque tourist destination—it was originally established as a coastal fortification and has spent centuries guarding one of the Mediterranean's busiest sea lanes. Established in 828 CE by Boniface II of Tuscany, the commune gradually became a meeting point for traders, soldiers, and sailors—each group contributing to the evolution of the town's structure. Bonifacio is divided into two sections, with the 'vieille ville' (old town)—also known as 'la Haute Ville' (the Upper City)—standing on a high cliff within the original citadel walls. Below, the marine area lines the narrow inlet with harbors, waterfront homes, and a growing valley community.
> 
> While here, the Bonifacio Citadel is a must-see. First built in the 9th century and expanded over time, it invites visitors to wander through quiet passageways, old military buildings, and cobblestone streets. Nearby, you can explore the Marine Cemetery, climb the King of Aragon's Stairway, and visit the Bastion de l'Étendard, now home to a small museum.

> 一波又一波的柔软丘陵绵延于帕卢斯地区。这片宁静的区域位于华盛顿州东南部，向爱达荷州和俄勒冈州的边界延伸。覆盖着小麦的坡地随着季节更迭而变换色彩。春季，丘陵呈现出郁郁葱葱的绿色，年轻的小麦和大麦开始生长；夏季则转变为干燥的金黄色，作物即将收割。
> 
> 常被誉为华盛顿州最宁静的自然奇观之一，帕卢斯地区标志性的起伏山丘源于一段古老而引人入胜的地质故事。这些类似沙丘的山丘并非由河流或地壳运动塑造，而是由来自干旱西南部的风吹尘土和细粒淤泥（即“黄土”）在数千年中逐渐堆积而成。在冰河时代，来自加拿大的冰川将岩石磨成细小的“冰川粉”，这些粉尘流入史前时期的冰川密苏拉湖。当冰坝决堤时，洪水席卷了华盛顿州东部，留下层层淤泥。随后，主导风将这些尘埃带到该地区，沉积成我们今天所见的丘陵。

<summary>Description</summary>

> Wave after wave of velvety hills stretch across the Palouse. This tranquil region lies in southeastern Washington, extending to the borders of Idaho and Oregon. The wheat-covered slopes shift in color with every passing season. In spring, the hills turn lush shades of green as young wheat and barley begin to grow, while summer transforms them into dry, golden browns as the crops near harvest.
> 
> Often hailed as one of Washington State's most serene natural wonders, the Palouse owes its signature rolling hills to an ancient and fascinating geological story. These dune-like hills were shaped over thousands of years—not by rivers or tectonic shifts, but by windblown dust and fine silt, known as 'loess,' carried from the arid Southwest. During the Ice Ages, glaciers from Canada ground rock into fine 'glacial flour,' which flowed into the prehistoric Glacial Lake Missoula. When ice dams broke, floods swept across eastern Washington, leaving behind layers of silt. Prevailing winds later carried that dust to this region, settling it into the hills we see today.
