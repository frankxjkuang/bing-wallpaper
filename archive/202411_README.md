> Today marks the start of Native American Heritage Month. Throughout November, we honor the history, traditions, stories, and languages of Native Peoples. The Indigenous Peoples of North America have played a significant role in shaping our country, including the food we eat and the medicines that heal us. In addition to being a celebration, this month is also a time to reflect on the issues that Native Peoples face, including civil and voting rights, land access, and education.
> 
> An important part of Native American heritage is the legacy that Indigenous Peoples have left on the landscape. One such place is Hovenweep National Monument on the Utah-Colorado border. Ancestral Pueblo people built the structures seen in today's image between 1200 and 1300 CE. All across Hovenweep are dwellings and circular and square towers. Although the purpose of these towers remains uncertain, they could have been used for defense, observing the stars, storing grain, or a combination of all of these. Here, the enduring legacy of America's Indigenous Peoples can still be felt.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Once upon a time, in the boundless grasslands of North America, there roamed creatures of great strength and majesty—the American bison. These animals were a key part of life for many Native American tribes, providing food, clothing, and tools. Their population dwindled perilously low in the late 1800s, falling from as many as 60 million to fewer than 1,000 due to excessive hunting and disease. Enter a group of conservationists, ranchers, and Native Americans who stepped in to save the species. Now, over 500,000 bison roam again, many in protected areas like Yellowstone National Park, featured in today's image. Today, on National Bison Day, observed every first Saturday in November, we honor these noble creatures—a testament to the American spirit and the monumental conservation efforts to save them.
> 
> It's no wonder the bison was officially named the national mammal in 2016. From the buffalo nickel to state flags, they are a deeply embedded symbol in American culture. Bison are North America's largest mammals, and they have been introduced as far away as Russia. While the bison has made a heroic recovery, the story isn't over. These animals still face challenges, including habitat loss and hunting.

> Today is the International Day for Biosphere Reserves. Biosphere reserves may sound like a mouthful, but they're essentially nature's sweet spots— biodiverse places that are home to a huge variety of life. These reserves, recognized by UNESCO, keep ecosystems healthy, protect endangered species, and help regulate climate through forests, wetlands, and other crucial habitats. There are 759 biosphere reserves across 136 countries. From the lush greenery of the Sundarbans in India to the vast expanses of the Great Sandy Biosphere Reserve in Australia, each reserve is unique.
> 
> Let's visit another—the Ría Lagartos Biosphere Reserve in Yucatán, Mexico, a UNESCO-protected sanctuary since 2004. Its forests and savannas cradle over 550 vertebrate species, including 142 species found only here. There are over 400 bird species in this reserve, including a large population of flamingos whose nests are seen in today's image. Biosphere reserves are all about balance, and Ría Lagartos is a prime example. Fishing, ecotourism, and even salt production are done in ways that respect the environment.

<summary>Description</summary>

> A place where poetry, history, and nature blend—welcome to Grasmere in England's Lake District. The village was once the cherished residence of the celebrated poet William Wordsworth, who described Grasmere, with its valley and lake of the same name, as 'the loveliest spot that man hath found.' Here, visitors are greeted by old cottages and homes built from local bluish-green slate. Dove Cottage, Wordsworth's humble abode from 1799 to 1808, and the adjacent museum offer a dive into the poet's life. His later residence, Rydal Mount, continues the story just a short journey away. The heart of the village is St. Oswald's Church, which dates to the 13th century and is Wordsworth's final resting place. Not far from the church, the aroma of the renowned Grasmere Gingerbread, made from a secret recipe, will set visitors' mouths watering.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Olympic National Park, established in 1938, offers an escape into unspoiled wilderness. It covers nearly 1,440 square miles on Washington's Olympic Peninsula. With a labyrinth of ecosystems that range from glacier-capped mountains to temperate rainforests, the park is a home for wildlife and an International Biosphere Reserve. Within it lies Shi Shi Beach, a serene stretch where the Pacific laps against sea stacks and sandy shores, as seen in today's image.
> 
> From here, you can follow one of the park's many trails and trek along the coast to see the beach's sea arch at Point of the Arches, an outcrop that has over 30 sea stacks, columns of rock rising from the beach. Within the park, visitors can get a closer look at Mount Olympus, spot over 300 bird species like red-breasted nuthatches, winter wrens, and spotted owls. They can also take a refreshing swim in Lake Crescent. The coastal wilderness area north of Cape Alava, including Shi Shi Beach, has been home to the Makah Tribe of the Pacific Northwest Coast for over 2,000 years. Visitors can gain an insight into their culture at the nearby Makah Reservation.
