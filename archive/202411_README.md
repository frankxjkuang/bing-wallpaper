> Today marks the start of Native American Heritage Month. Throughout November, we honor the history, traditions, stories, and languages of Native Peoples. The Indigenous Peoples of North America have played a significant role in shaping our country, including the food we eat and the medicines that heal us. In addition to being a celebration, this month is also a time to reflect on the issues that Native Peoples face, including civil and voting rights, land access, and education.
> 
> An important part of Native American heritage is the legacy that Indigenous Peoples have left on the landscape. One such place is Hovenweep National Monument on the Utah-Colorado border. Ancestral Pueblo people built the structures seen in today's image between 1200 and 1300 CE. All across Hovenweep are dwellings and circular and square towers. Although the purpose of these towers remains uncertain, they could have been used for defense, observing the stars, storing grain, or a combination of all of these. Here, the enduring legacy of America's Indigenous Peoples can still be felt.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Once upon a time, in the boundless grasslands of North America, there roamed creatures of great strength and majesty—the American bison. These animals were a key part of life for many Native American tribes, providing food, clothing, and tools. Their population dwindled perilously low in the late 1800s, falling from as many as 60 million to fewer than 1,000 due to excessive hunting and disease. Enter a group of conservationists, ranchers, and Native Americans who stepped in to save the species. Now, over 500,000 bison roam again, many in protected areas like Yellowstone National Park, featured in today's image. Today, on National Bison Day, observed every first Saturday in November, we honor these noble creatures—a testament to the American spirit and the monumental conservation efforts to save them.
> 
> It's no wonder the bison was officially named the national mammal in 2016. From the buffalo nickel to state flags, they are a deeply embedded symbol in American culture. Bison are North America's largest mammals, and they have been introduced as far away as Russia. While the bison has made a heroic recovery, the story isn't over. These animals still face challenges, including habitat loss and hunting.

> Today is the International Day for Biosphere Reserves. Biosphere reserves may sound like a mouthful, but they're essentially nature's sweet spots— biodiverse places that are home to a huge variety of life. These reserves, recognized by UNESCO, keep ecosystems healthy, protect endangered species, and help regulate climate through forests, wetlands, and other crucial habitats. There are 759 biosphere reserves across 136 countries. From the lush greenery of the Sundarbans in India to the vast expanses of the Great Sandy Biosphere Reserve in Australia, each reserve is unique.
> 
> Let's visit another—the Ría Lagartos Biosphere Reserve in Yucatán, Mexico, a UNESCO-protected sanctuary since 2004. Its forests and savannas cradle over 550 vertebrate species, including 142 species found only here. There are over 400 bird species in this reserve, including a large population of flamingos whose nests are seen in today's image. Biosphere reserves are all about balance, and Ría Lagartos is a prime example. Fishing, ecotourism, and even salt production are done in ways that respect the environment.

<summary>Description</summary>

> A place where poetry, history, and nature blend—welcome to Grasmere in England's Lake District. The village was once the cherished residence of the celebrated poet William Wordsworth, who described Grasmere, with its valley and lake of the same name, as 'the loveliest spot that man hath found.' Here, visitors are greeted by old cottages and homes built from local bluish-green slate. Dove Cottage, Wordsworth's humble abode from 1799 to 1808, and the adjacent museum offer a dive into the poet's life. His later residence, Rydal Mount, continues the story just a short journey away. The heart of the village is St. Oswald's Church, which dates to the 13th century and is Wordsworth's final resting place. Not far from the church, the aroma of the renowned Grasmere Gingerbread, made from a secret recipe, will set visitors' mouths watering.

> Amidst the mist-covered cedars and Sitka spruces of Canada's Great Bear Rainforest, the Vancouver Coastal Sea wolf roams free. These canines thrive in this ecosystem in British Columbia, which stretches from the north of Vancouver Island to the Alaskan border. This unique subspecies of the gray wolf is specific to the region and leads a semi-aquatic lifestyle, swimming between islands in search of food. Unlike other wolf species, they have a marine-based diet, consisting of fish, clams, mussels, crabs, otters, and seals. These animals live in packs, communicating with each other through growls, barks, and whines, so they're often heard before they are seen.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Iceland's glacial rivers have shaped the landscape here in the land of fire and ice over thousands of years. The rivers seen in today's image are formed from the meltwater of vast glaciers like Vatnajökull, Langjökull, and Hofsjökull. Vatnajökull, the largest ice cap in Iceland, covers over 3,000 square miles—approximately 10% of the country's landmass. As the glaciers melt, the water carries fine sediments, creating a braided river system with a milky appearance that contrasts with the earthy tones of the volcanic terrain. Every spring and summer, the rivers swell with seasonal meltwater, continually shaping and reshaping the land. Aerial views reveal their intricate patterns, interwoven across the terrain toward the North Atlantic Ocean. The water also powers hydroelectric power stations, reinforcing Iceland's status as a leader in sustainable energy.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Ever seen a group of flamingos take to the skies? If you have, there's a good chance they were Caribbean flamingos, also known as American flamingos, as seen in Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico, in today's image. Flamingos are referred to as a flamboyance when in a group, but they can also be called a stand, colony, or pat. The Caribbean flamingo is the largest flamingo species in the Americas and the only one native to North America. These vibrant birds are typically found around brackish and saltwater areas, like marshes, estuaries, and along coastlines. Because of their pink color, they're often confused with roseate spoonbills. However, their long necks and bent bills distinguish them from other wading birds like the great blue heron and wood stork.
> 
> Found across regions like the southeastern United States, northern South America, the Galápagos Islands, and Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula, Caribbean flamingos are well adapted for short migrations in search of food. Using long legs and webbed feet, they hunt shallow waters for shrimp, crustaceans, mollusks, fish, and algae. Their habitats are increasingly threatened by coastal development, pollution, and rising sea levels, putting their population at risk. Yet, Caribbean flamingos still amaze us when they soar gracefully through the skies.

> Freedom is not free, and nobody understands that better than veterans. Today, America honors its military men and women for their service. The holiday originally celebrated a temporary halt in fighting between Allied nations and Germany during World War I—the official end of the war came the following year in 1919. Armistice Day, as it was later named, commemorated this respite, and it became a federal holiday in 1938. A few years later, America fought in World War II, and later, the Korean War. As a result, Congress amended the holiday in 1954, exchanging the word 'Armistice' with 'Veterans' to include veterans of all the country's wars.

> Red as far as the eye can see and clear blue skies overhead. Welcome to Arches National Park, Utah. The story of this otherworldly landscape starts 65 million years ago when a dry seabed stood here. Over time, geological forces warped and squeezed the land, twisting the sandstone into lumps and bumps. Later, wind and water carved out the arches, pinnacles, fins, and balanced rocks that now stand in this area. The park has more than 2,000 natural stone arches, the highest concentration of these structures anywhere on Earth. In today's image, we can see two of them: Double Arch, as seen through Cove Arch. The larger arch of Double Arch spans 144 feet and is 112 feet tall, the tallest and second-longest of the park's arches.

> Humans arrived in the area around 10,000 years ago. Fremont and Ancestral Pueblo people lived here until the 14th century. Later, the Ute and Paiute tribes made their homes in the area. In 1929, it was declared a national monument. However, it wasn't until November 12, 1971, that it became a national park. Today, more than 1.8 million visitors come to Arches National Park every year.

> Take a stroll along almost any marina from Costa Rica to Alaska, and you'll likely hear the playful barks of sea lions echo through the air. California sea lions, like the one pictured, are a common sight basking in the sun along the rocky shores of North America's western coast. These marine mammals, belonging to the pinniped group, are often mistaken for seals. An easy way to distinguish between them is by looking at their ears—sea lions have visible flaps, seals don't.
> 
> Sea lions also have a special relationship with giant kelp, seen in today's image from Baja California, Mexico. These towering underwater plants, which can grow up to 175 feet in ideal conditions, sway gently with the currents, creating beautiful scenery. Kelp forests are home to a diverse array of marine life, including sea lions, tiny invertebrates like snails, prawns, and jellyfish, and a wide range of fish, like cod, rockfish, and wrasse. Sea lions twist and turn through the thick kelp strands, hunting fish hiding within the leaves. They also use kelp as refuge from predators like sharks, blending in with the fronds of the brown algae to avoid detection. Kelp's rapid growth makes it an ideal habitat for marine life of all types to thrive.

> Known for its rows of pastel houses that stretch down to the Mediterranean Sea, Manarola, seen in today's image, is a picturesque village on the Italian Riviera. Perched on the rugged cliffs of the Ligurian coast, it's one of the five villages that make up Cinque Terre National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The name 'Manarola' might have evolved from the Latin 'Magna rota,' which means 'large wheel,' a nod to the village's historical mill wheel.
> 
> Believed to be the oldest village in the Cinque Terre, dating to 1338, Manarola's history is rooted in fishing and winemaking. Sciacchetrà, a dessert wine unique to this area, has long been immortalized in the verses of Italian poets. Take a walk along the Via dell'Amore, or 'Path of Love'—a scenic coastal trail connecting Manarola to its neighboring village, Riomaggiore—and you can sense the romance and charm that defines this region. Legend has it that the footpath became a meeting place for lovers from the two villages. Time slows down when you're in Manarola, and the magic of the country's coastal heritage comes to life.

<summary>Description</summary>

> As twilight descends today, Chiang Mai, Thailand's second-largest city, will come alive with thousands of glowing lanterns for Yi Peng. Held on the full moon of the second month of the Lanna lunar calendar, this celebration is about letting go of negativity and embracing new beginnings. The highlight of the festival is the release of 'khom loi' or 'khom loy'—floating paper lanterns—into the night sky, which becomes a sea of warm, golden lights. People often write their hopes and dreams on the lanterns. They gather around temples and palaces to send their wishes skyward, hoping for good fortune in the year to come.
> 
> In addition to the lantern release, the city hosts vibrant parades, traditional dance performances, and stunning decorations. Yi Peng coincides with Loy Krathong, another festival where small, intricately crafted baskets, decorated with banana leaves, incense, and candles, are floated down rivers. Together, these festivals create a spectacle that draws visitors from across the world to witness the illumination of Chiang Mai.

> If you've ever dreamed of walking on water, or something close to it, the Wadden Sea is the place for you. Tracing over 300 miles along the coast of the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark, this UNESCO World Heritage Site offers a unique landscape of tidal flats and wetlands. In fact, it is the world's largest unbroken intertidal zone—underwater at high tide and exposed at low tide—of sand and mud flats. The area is also a playground for aquatic species such as houting fish, brown trout, and white-beaked dolphins, and is home to birds like waders and herons.
> 
> Pictured here is the Wadden Sea coast in Friesland, Netherlands. This coast is dotted with charming fishing villages and medieval churches. Mudflat hiking is a recreational pastime here—the Dutch call it wadlopen. As the tide recedes, mud-trampers can walk across the seabed, squishing through the mud and wading through shallow waters. Whether you're up for a wadlopen challenge or a seal-spotting safari, there's plenty of adventure to be found here. Just don't forget your boots—things are bound to get a little messy!

<summary>Description</summary>

> Striking appearance, strong presence, and impressive antlers—meet the red deer, photographed in the ancient forests of Glen Affric, one of Scotland's most beautiful valleys. Found across Europe, Asia, and parts of North Africa, this species is Britain's largest land mammal and an integral part of the Caledonian pinewoods, Scotland's coniferous forests. From featuring in cave art found throughout Europe to medieval hunting traditions, red deer have always held a special place in the human imagination. In many parts of the world, their image is synonymous with the wild, free spirit of nature. Glen Affric, with its lochs, moorlands, and mountains, provides the perfect habitat for these magnificent creatures. This national nature reserve is also popular with hikers, climbers, and nature enthusiasts.
> 
> The Scottish red deer is a subspecies that is slightly smaller than its counterparts in continental Europe. This species exhibits insular dwarfism, a process where large animals evolve to have smaller bodies over many generations.

<summary>Description</summary>

> With waves crashing against its sturdy base and a stormy sea swirling around, this lighthouse in Porthcawl, on the south coast of Wales, has been standing resilient since 1860. At 30 feet tall, Porthcawl Lighthouse, designed by the eminent engineer James Walker, is often pictured being battered by waves when storms hit. The town's rugged coastline, with its hidden rocky coves, has always posed a perilous challenge to sailors. Porthcawl Lighthouse was built to help guide the increasing maritime traffic along the Bristol Channel. This cast-iron lighthouse was the last one in the UK to be powered by coal and gas. Although it was converted to electric power in 1997, the lighthouse still maintains its historical charm.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Ready for a coastal adventure? Welcome to Tasman National Park in Tasmania, an island state of Australia about 150 miles off its southeastern coast. Spanning more than 41 square miles, this park features dramatic cliffs and distinctive columns of dolerite rock. Tasmans Arch, seen in today's image, is a standout example. Shaped over time by the Tasman Sea, it was once the roof of a massive sea cave. The sea's pressure, combined with air, sand, and stones, slowly pried open the vertical cracks in the cliff, dislodging chunks of rock. The cave kept growing, deepening, and lengthening, until it eventually gave way, leaving behind this towering natural bridge. Tasmans Arch is named after the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman, who also lends his name to the state of Tasmania.

> What's more creative than a young mind? This World Children's Day, let's celebrate the boundless imagination of kids and the ideas they bring to life. A UNICEF initiative, this day is a global day of action for children, by children, which marks the UN's adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Kids are raising their voices on issues ranging from conflict and climate change to mental health and discrimination, in a bid to influence the future.
> 
> Featured in today's image is the giant land art painting 'Beyond Crisis' in Leysin, Switzerland. It was created by French contemporary artist Saype in 2020 in response to the pandemic. Saype is renowned for his ultra-realistic giant nature paintings—this fresco spanned over 32,000 square feet—made using biodegradable paint. Through the eyes of a little girl gazing at the horizon, the artist envisioned a more united and humane world. The arc of figures she draws serves as a powerful reminder that, in times of crisis, we must focus on what lies ahead together.

> Curious about what it's like to be a lion cub living in the wild? Let's explore their life. African lion cubs like those featured here, sunbathing in the wilderness of South Africa, start life tucked away in a secluded den. Blind at birth, these little ones are vulnerable in the first few weeks of their lives and depend entirely on their mothers. At around 8 weeks old, they meet the rest of the pride and learn to socialize so they can find their place in the group. After they hit 6 months, they begin to go out hunting with adults, learning essential skills through real-life adventures.
> 
> Lions enter adolescence around 2 years old, and they reach maturity by 3 or 4. At this point, young males leave their mothers and group with other males, while females remain to hunt and breed in the same pride. For the lion cubs in today's image, their early experiences will lay the foundation for their place in the wild.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Perched atop a sandstone outcrop high in the Sierra de Caldereros stands the Castle of Zafra. When the Christian kingdoms of northern Spain took the region from its Moorish defenders in the 12th century, they built this castle on the site of an older fortress to defend the borderland between the two powers. Over the years, it withstood countless battles of the Reconquista—the military campaigns waged by Christian kingdoms against Muslim rule in Spain—and of the Castilian Civil War of the 14th century.
> 
> When the fighting ended in the late 15th century, the Castle of Zafra was no longer strategically important and began to fall into ruin. In 1971, Don Antonio Sanz Polo, a descendant of the castle's last warden, bought the site from the Spanish state. He then spent the next 30 years restoring the castle. These days, you're more likely to see the Castle of Zafra on the screen than in a history book—it doubled as the Tower of Joy in the sixth season of 'Game of Thrones.'
