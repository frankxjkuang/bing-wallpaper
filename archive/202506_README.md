> 'Life under the sea is better than anything they got up there,' Sebastian the crab once told Ariel. But are we doing enough to protect that underwater world? On June 1, we celebrate World Reef Awareness Day, a time to recognize the beauty—and fragility—of coral reef ecosystems. One magnificent example is the New Caledonian barrier reef, which wraps around Grande Terre, New Caledonia's largest island. At over 930 miles long, it's one of the longest continuous barrier reefs in the world. Its vast 9,300-square-mile lagoon is home to over 2,300 fish species, endangered dugongs, green sea turtles, and migrating humpback whales.

> Reefs like this face growing threats—from pollution, mining runoff, rising ocean temperatures, and even harmful chemicals in some sunscreens. Increased tourism can also strain these fragile ecosystems. This World Reef Awareness Day, commit to reef-friendly choices: use reef-safe sunscreen, reduce plastic waste, and support conservation efforts in your community or online.

> This year, the first week of June marks National Garden Week—a time to celebrate the joy of gardening and the beauty it brings to our lives. Gardening not only connects us to nature but also boosts our mental health and physical well-being. Just spending time outdoors provides Vitamin D from the sun, which helps our bones stay strong and supports a healthy immune system.

Native to North America, coneflowers and other members of the Echinacea genus are loved by both gardeners and pollinators for their hardy blooms and spiky centers. Whether you plant a few flowers or create a whole garden, this week is a perfect opportunity to get your hands in the dirt and enjoy the simple pleasures of nature.

> If there's one place that brings the cycling spirit to life, it's the Netherlands. For World Bicycle Day, today's image captures bicycles lined up on a bridge in the Dutch city of Utrecht. More than half the journeys around the city happen on bikes, surpassing cars and other modes of travel. Nearly everyone lives within 15 minutes of essentials—and over 90% of residents can reach key places in just 10 minutes. This wasn't always the case. It was only in the 1970s, sparked by an oil crisis, rising car-related issues, and strong social movements, that the Netherlands started prioritizing bikes over cars. Since then, cities have embraced bike-friendly streets, dedicated lanes, and traffic lights for cyclists. And thanks to the famously flat landscape, cycling here feels as natural as walking.
