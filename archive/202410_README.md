> There's a reason why famed American photographer Ansel Adams fell in love with Yosemite National Park: vistas like today's image of Half Dome. The park, in central California's Sierra Nevada range, has been a popular destination for artists, mountaineers, settlers, and nature lovers since the mid-1800s. To protect it from logging and overgrazing by cattle, Congress designated Yosemite a national park on this day in 1890. It's one of the most visited parks in the US, with more than 3 million visitors a year.
> 
> At almost 9,000 feet tall, Half Dome is only one of Yosemite's geological wonders. Other famous climbing destinations include El Capitan and Mount Lyell, which at 13,114 feet tall is the park's highest summit. Yosemite is also famous for its waterfalls and is home to giant sequoia trees, black bears, mountain lions, and endangered Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep.

> Ever wonder how some of our rivers stay unspoiled? It's thanks to the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, which was signed into law on this day in 1968. This legislation created the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System which preserves rivers with exceptional natural, cultural, and recreational qualities.
> 
> The national rivers system oversees more than 13,000 miles of 228 rivers across 41 states, and Puerto Rico, a tiny fraction of the 3.5 million miles of US rivers. It categorizes rivers as wild, scenic, or recreational. The Wind River in northeastern Alaska, seen in today's image, is a wild river, isolated and undeveloped. This 85-mile river flows from the Philip Smith Mountains to the East Fork of the Chandalar River, winding through a valley filled with lakes and wetlands. Part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, this river valley is a bustling habitat for Dall sheep, moose, caribou, and grizzly bears. In a changing world, it's comforting to know these rivers will remain unchanged.

> Let's explore the Taj Mahal, on the banks of the Yamuna River in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. This ivory-white marble mausoleum was commissioned in 1631 by Shah Jahan, the fifth Mughal emperor, to honor his late wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.
> 
> This tomb is the centerpiece of a sprawling 42-acre complex, which also includes a mosque, a guest house, and beautifully landscaped gardens surrounded by a grand wall. The tomb is flanked by giant arches and alcoves that merge Indo-Islamic and Mughal architectural styles. It's also an incredible architectural feat, with the outer dome reaching around 145 feet high and the inner one standing more 75 feet. Celebrated as a jewel of Muslim art and a global masterpiece, the Taj Mahal was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.

> Today, we're blasting off to explore the cosmos. World Space Week celebrates the science and technology that go into exploring our universe, and how it benefits us back on Earth. Space exploration has helped scientists develop new medicines, create new power sources, and even improve farming techniques. This year's theme is Space and Climate Change; events will be held in 83 countries to champion the role of space technology in understanding and monitoring Earth's climate.
> 
> Space exploration has also led to amazing photographs of our solar system, like the one featured here today. Europa is one of Jupiter's 95 known moons. Its surface is mainly made up of frozen water, which has broken up and refrozen, creating the patterns seen on its surface. Although Europa is just a quarter of the size of Earth, it may contain twice the amount of water. Space Week is the perfect time to take a moment to appreciate the wonders of our solar system, and beyond!

> Today we celebrate the real influencers—Happy World Teachers' Day! Every year on October 5, we recognize the essential role of teachers in nurturing young minds, while acknowledging the challenges they face.
> 
> Pictured in today's image, African elephants, the largest land mammals, are celebrated for their extraordinary intelligence. Elephants are remarkable teachers, guiding their young on how to find water, safe food, and navigate complex social dynamics. Through gentle nudging, vocalizations, and demonstrations, elephant mothers pass down vital knowledge that helps their young survive in the wild. Sadly, they face significant threats from habitat loss and poaching. As we admire these majestic creatures and strive to protect them, we can learn valuable lessons about empathy, cooperation, and the importance of community—reminding us that, just like elephants, we never forget a great teacher.
