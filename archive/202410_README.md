> There's a reason why famed American photographer Ansel Adams fell in love with Yosemite National Park: vistas like today's image of Half Dome. The park, in central California's Sierra Nevada range, has been a popular destination for artists, mountaineers, settlers, and nature lovers since the mid-1800s. To protect it from logging and overgrazing by cattle, Congress designated Yosemite a national park on this day in 1890. It's one of the most visited parks in the US, with more than 3 million visitors a year.
> 
> At almost 9,000 feet tall, Half Dome is only one of Yosemite's geological wonders. Other famous climbing destinations include El Capitan and Mount Lyell, which at 13,114 feet tall is the park's highest summit. Yosemite is also famous for its waterfalls and is home to giant sequoia trees, black bears, mountain lions, and endangered Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep.

> Ever wonder how some of our rivers stay unspoiled? It's thanks to the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, which was signed into law on this day in 1968. This legislation created the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System which preserves rivers with exceptional natural, cultural, and recreational qualities.
> 
> The national rivers system oversees more than 13,000 miles of 228 rivers across 41 states, and Puerto Rico, a tiny fraction of the 3.5 million miles of US rivers. It categorizes rivers as wild, scenic, or recreational. The Wind River in northeastern Alaska, seen in today's image, is a wild river, isolated and undeveloped. This 85-mile river flows from the Philip Smith Mountains to the East Fork of the Chandalar River, winding through a valley filled with lakes and wetlands. Part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, this river valley is a bustling habitat for Dall sheep, moose, caribou, and grizzly bears. In a changing world, it's comforting to know these rivers will remain unchanged.

> Let's explore the Taj Mahal, on the banks of the Yamuna River in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. This ivory-white marble mausoleum was commissioned in 1631 by Shah Jahan, the fifth Mughal emperor, to honor his late wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.
> 
> This tomb is the centerpiece of a sprawling 42-acre complex, which also includes a mosque, a guest house, and beautifully landscaped gardens surrounded by a grand wall. The tomb is flanked by giant arches and alcoves that merge Indo-Islamic and Mughal architectural styles. It's also an incredible architectural feat, with the outer dome reaching around 145 feet high and the inner one standing more 75 feet. Celebrated as a jewel of Muslim art and a global masterpiece, the Taj Mahal was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.

> Today, we're blasting off to explore the cosmos. World Space Week celebrates the science and technology that go into exploring our universe, and how it benefits us back on Earth. Space exploration has helped scientists develop new medicines, create new power sources, and even improve farming techniques. This year's theme is Space and Climate Change; events will be held in 83 countries to champion the role of space technology in understanding and monitoring Earth's climate.
> 
> Space exploration has also led to amazing photographs of our solar system, like the one featured here today. Europa is one of Jupiter's 95 known moons. Its surface is mainly made up of frozen water, which has broken up and refrozen, creating the patterns seen on its surface. Although Europa is just a quarter of the size of Earth, it may contain twice the amount of water. Space Week is the perfect time to take a moment to appreciate the wonders of our solar system, and beyond!

> Today we celebrate the real influencers—Happy World Teachers' Day! Every year on October 5, we recognize the essential role of teachers in nurturing young minds, while acknowledging the challenges they face.
> 
> Pictured in today's image, African elephants, the largest land mammals, are celebrated for their extraordinary intelligence. Elephants are remarkable teachers, guiding their young on how to find water, safe food, and navigate complex social dynamics. Through gentle nudging, vocalizations, and demonstrations, elephant mothers pass down vital knowledge that helps their young survive in the wild. Sadly, they face significant threats from habitat loss and poaching. As we admire these majestic creatures and strive to protect them, we can learn valuable lessons about empathy, cooperation, and the importance of community—reminding us that, just like elephants, we never forget a great teacher.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Today, we celebrate a creature with three hearts and the uncanny ability to change color at will: the octopus. Octopuses are cephalopods, marine animals like squids and cuttlefish that have tentacles. Among their many species is the small and shy mototi octopus, pictured here. It was discovered in 1999 around Rapa Island in the South Pacific and is known for the 'fake eyes' or ocelli—vibrant blue and yellow rings—between its eyes and arms. Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia, and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown color but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous. But you don't need to worry about running into one, because they tend to be shy and solitary, often hiding in crevices, shells, or human-made objects like bottles and cans.

Native to parts of Europe and Asia, kochia, also known as 'summer cypress,' is now widespread throughout the world. But it has a special place in Japan's Hitachi Seaside Park, seen in today's image, where around 30,000–40,000 kochia bushes are planted each year. These ornamental plants create a surreal landscape for visitors to wander through and also hold significance in Japanese culture. Historically, they have been dried to create brooms. However, not all parts of the kochia are destined to sweep the Earth—some are used for food. The plant's nuts, 'tonburi,' often called 'field caviar,' are a prized garnish.

The bar-tailed godwit embarks on a 6,835-mile nonstop flight across the Pacific from Alaska to New Zealand. The tiny ruby-throated hummingbird, weighing less than a nickel, makes the trip all the way across the Gulf of Mexico. Migratory birds navigate the globe, instinctively knowing when and where to move to exploit seasonal abundance.

During the breeding season, from February to April, you'll find the females laying 7–15 eggs. From the eastern and western United States and southern Canada, these ducks migrate southward in the fall to avoid harsh winter conditions. By October and November, they move towards milder climates in the southeastern US and occasionally into Mexico.

The Royal Alcázar of Seville, in the southern region of Andalusia, stands on the site of a 10th-century citadel, which was expanded over the following 200 years. When Christian forces captured the city in 1248, this historic palace was almost totally rebuilt in the Mudejar style, which takes inspiration from the intricate patterns and decorative motifs found in Islamic architecture. Within the Alcázar, there are several courtyards lined with delicately carved columns. One of these is the Patio de las Doncellas, or Courtyard of the Maidens, pictured here today.

Look a little closer at these arches, and you'll see carved shells, Hands of Fatima—a symbol said to bring protection—plants, and Arabic script. Behind the columns, the walls are decorated with colorful ceramic tiles decorated with geometric patterns. These tiles, known as azulejos, are a hallmark of Andalusian decoration. Outside, there is a large garden full of fountains and tree-lined paths—a perfect spot to cool off from the hot Spanish sun.

> Today's image takes us to one of the places that Indigenous Peoples' legacy can still be seen. In the rocks of the Grand Canyon, the Nankoweap Granaries were carved by the Ancestral Pueblo culture around 1100 CE. Used to keep the crops that were grown safe from the elements, these granaries could be fully sealed when needed. The Ancestral Pueblo people lived in the Four Corners region, building houses and other structures out of stone and adobe, or carving them into canyon walls.

<summary>Description</summary>

> They say the grass is always greener on the other side, and no one takes that more literally than the wildebeests of the Serengeti in Tanzania. Every July, roughly 2 million of these determined grazers, along with zebras and other herbivores, set off on a journey north to the Masai Mara in Kenya in search of lush pastures and fresh water. The great migration, considered one of the seven wonders of the natural world, is a safari spectacle where survival is the prize.
> 
> One of the most dramatic moments of the migration is the crossing of the Mara River at the border between Tanzania and Kenya. Thousands of wildebeests gather at the riverbank, aware that danger lurks beneath the surface—the crocodiles—not to mention the lions and leopards that patrol the banks. When the first wildebeest takes the plunge, it's a wild rush as the rest of the herd follows, creating a chaotic scene. Some make it across, while others become part of the food chain. As October rolls around and the rains return to the Serengeti, the herds begin their journey back south, completing the cycle once again.

> If you're a fan of dinosaurs, trilobites, or fossilized shells, then National Fossil Day is the perfect excuse to get your hands dirty. Celebrated on the second Wednesday of October, this day is dedicated to promoting the scientific and educational value of fossils. From towering T. rexes to tiny ammonites, these ancient remains help scientists piece together the puzzle of our planet's history.
> 
> Let's visit the Jurassic Coast, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Dorset, England, pictured here today. It's like a giant natural history museum, with rocks and cliffs that reveal 185 million years of Earth's history. But what really steals the show are the fossils, especially those of belemnites and ammonites—extinct marine creatures—that are pictured here. Mary Anning, a pioneering fossil hunter who combed these shores two centuries ago, paved the way for our current understanding of fossils. Now, it's your turn. Embrace National Fossil Day by embarking on your own journey through time.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Mars, the fourth planet from the sun, is often referred to as the 'Red Planet' due to its rusty hue from the iron oxide-rich soil dust. The planet is dotted with frosty dunes, largely located in the high latitudes of the northern plains. Mars' atmosphere is composed of nearly 96% carbon dioxide, which is why carbon ice forms on the surface. These dunes showcase the dynamic interaction between Mars' thin atmosphere, its surface, and seasonal temperature changes.
> 
> As the Martian seasons change, the frost layer transforms directly from solid to gas as temperatures rise. The dunes then gradually lose their frosty appearance, and the cycle repeats with each cold season. Data collected from spacecraft and orbiters, like NASA's Phoenix spacecraft and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, has helped us to better understand these intriguing frost-covered formations.

<summary>Description</summary>

> Every autumn, many of the 18,000 trees in Central Park, New York, are painted in shades of yellow, red, and orange. It's one of Central Park's most photographed seasons, and fall in the park has provided iconic backdrops for movies like 'When Harry Met Sally…' and 'Hair.' Trees sense the coming of winter not only by temperature, but by the angle at which sunlight hits their leaves. Because of New York's buildings, the unique interaction of light, shadows, and temperatures often results in fall foliage occurring later in the park than the rest of the city.
> 
> Today's image features fall in the Mall, a pedestrian walkway designed and built in the mid-1800s. Flanked by benches and American elm trees, the Mall's canopy was meant to evoke an architectural space like a cathedral. The quarter-mile promenade is the park's only straight path, and it was intended to be a place for New Yorkers of all classes and backgrounds to gather, stroll, sit, and perhaps ponder the passing seasons.

> 10月20日是国际树懒日，世界上最慢的哺乳动物将成为人们关注的焦点。今天，让我们更多地了解树懒的生活，包括它们面临的威胁，如栖息地的缩小，以及如何为保护树懒出一份力。现存树懒有六种，分为两类：三趾树懒和二趾树懒。
> 
> 今天的图片展示的是三趾树懒，这是一种悠闲、爱树的哺乳动物，主要生活在南美洲和中美洲的热带地区。它们的尾巴很短，四肢上有三个带爪的脚趾，这有助于它们轻松地抓住树枝。树懒主要以树叶为食，不过它们也可以靠吃水果和树液来维持生命。为了帮助它们分解那些坚韧的纤维状树叶，它们有一个特殊的多腔胃。由于它们的新陈代谢非常缓慢，消化也需要很长时间，因此它们每天不需要太多食物就能生存。不仅它们的胃蠕动得很慢，它们的动作也很慢，以至于藻类经常在它们的皮毛上生长，让他们的毛色发绿，这也为它们伪装自己提供了方便。

<summary>Description</summary>

> The world's slowest mammal takes the spotlight today on International Sloth Day. Celebrated on October 20, it highlights their lives, conservation efforts, and the threats they face, including shrinking habitats. There are six living sloth species, divided into two types: three-toed sloths and two-toed sloths.
> 
> Today's image features the laid-back, tree-loving, three-toed sloth, found in the tropical regions of South and Central America. With three clawed toes on each limb, they cling onto branches with ease. Sloths are mainly leaf eaters, and to help them break down tough, fibrous leaves, they have a special multi-chambered stomach. With their super slow metabolism, digestion takes its sweet time, and they don't need much food each day to get by. They're so slow-moving that algae often develop on their fur, giving a greenish tint that provides them camouflage.

> The sturdy, swamp-loving, cypress trees pictured in the mist on our homepage can grow over 100 feet tall. These towering specimens are found in George L. Smith State Park, which spans 1,634 acres in Emanuel County, Georgia. The park's centerpiece is a 412-acre mill pond, a favorite spot for fishing and canoeing. Out of its waters grow pond cypress and bald cypress trees, two varieties that are native to the southeastern US. Winding through the park are over 7 miles of nature trails, leading visitors through sandy landscapes past a bird sanctuary and tortoise habitat. The hardwood trees here are a haven for woodpeckers and other birds, while the soft soil provides ideal burrowing ground for tortoises. No matter the season, this park promises a peaceful retreat for all.
