> This stunning structure is the stone pavilion housing the massive Korean Bell of Friendship in Los Angeles, a city with a large Korean American population. It's ringing in Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month, which starts today. The month was chosen in recognition of the first documented arrival of Japanese immigrants, on May 7, 1843, and the completion of the transcontinental railroad by more than 20,000 Asian immigrants on May 10, 1869.
> 
> Back to that intricately decorated bronze bell. It was a gift to the city from South Korea to mark the US bicentennial in 1976 and is modeled on the largest bell cast in Korean history, the Divine Bell of King Seongdeok, made in 771. Both versions are among the largest bells in the world.

> Today we're exploring a place of otherworldly beauty: the Jöriseen, a group of alpine lakes near Davos, Switzerland. On sunny days, the lakes glow an ethereal blue, contrasting with the dark, jagged Silvretta Alps that encircle them. The sunlight is reflected in the water by 'rock flour'—silt-sized rock particles generated from the grinding of bedrock by glaciers.
> 
> The Silvretta Alps sit across the Swiss-Austrian border and are themselves surrounded by glaciers in an area known as the 'Blue Silvretta.' If you want to enjoy these stunning views up close, you'll have to work for it. Bring your best hiking boots, plenty of water, and some strong legs.

> Welcome to Kenya's Maasai Mara National Reserve, where some of its most iconic inhabitants are out for an evening stroll. Wildebeests, also known as gnus, are social animals which often form large herds. There are two types: black wildebeests and blue wildebeests and it is the latter which take part in the famous Great Migration, one of the world's greatest wildlife spectacles.
> 
> This typically starts in January or February and sees more than a million wildebeests, along with large herds of zebras and other species, migrate from the Serengeti in neighboring Tanzania to the Maasai Mara in search of water and greener pastures. They arrive in Kenya from late July and stay until November when they start moving south again, a round trip of some 500 miles. Tourists flock to the Maasai Mara to witness this incredible natural spectacle.

> 与许多人的看法相反，5月5日并不是墨西哥的独立日。 真正的墨西哥独立日是在每年的9月16日庆祝。 而5月5日是为了庆祝在1862年的这一天墨西哥在普埃布拉战役中战胜法兰西帝国。虽然这一天是为了纪念一个重大的历史事件，但墨西哥的庆祝活动相对平静，主要集中在普埃布拉。

> 在墨西哥，这一天被称为“普埃布拉战役日”，因为当时的墨西哥总统贝尼托·巴勃罗·胡亚雷斯·加尔卡 (Benito Pablo Juárez Garca) 于 1862 年宣布这一节日为国定假日。今天，普埃布拉人民通过游行、演讲和战斗重演来庆祝。图中的 普埃布拉天主堂又称济世圣母教堂(Nuestra Señora de los Remedios )在普埃布拉战役爆发时已经有将近 300 年的历史。

<summary>Description</summary>

> Peeking out above the trees in the Făgăraș Mountains of Romania is Poenari Castle, a fortress steeped in history and legend. In the 15th century, this castle was occupied by the notorious ruler Vlad III, aka Vlad the Impaler, aka Vlad Dracula.
> 
> Vlad wasn't a vampire, but he had a reputation for cruelty towards his enemies. His bloody resistance to Ottoman encroachment made him a national hero and the subject of much folklore—some of it gruesome. These tales are likely what inspired author Bram Stoker to name his fictional vampire Count Dracula.
> 
> Poenari Castle was abandoned decades after Vlad's death in 1476. Over the centuries, it fell into ruin as earthquakes and landslides sent parts of the building down the cliff and into the Argeș River below. Visiting the ruins today requires a bit of stamina. It's a 1,480-step climb to the citadel walls, unless you can change into a bat and fly to the top.

Squeezed into a small Norwegian fishing village, it's fair to say that Henningsvær Stadion's grounds will probably never host a UEFA Champions League. But, while it lacks stands for spectators, there's still plenty of atmosphere to soak up in this striking location. Those who play here do so surrounded by the sound of waves, seabirds, and the smells of salt air and cod, drying on the racks surrounding the pitch.

> These stunning wild lupines bring shades of blue, pink, and purple to meadows and roadsides from early spring. They are not just a stunning addition to the landscape—they are crucial for the survival of the rare Karner blue butterfly. The larvae of the short-lived species will only feed on wild blue lupines, crawling up their stems to eat new leaves when they hatch. Once widespread across much of eastern North America, wild lupines have been in decline since the Industrial Revolution and human development has reduced their range. This has had a knock-on effect on the butterflies, which are now an endangered species. Conservation efforts have focused on replanting areas of wild blue lupines to boost butterfly numbers.

> The migration of birds, such as the pelicans seen here over California's Salton Sea, is part of the pulse of our planet's ecosystem. Around 40% of bird species migrate, typically in the fall and spring, some traveling incredible distances. Tiny hummingbirds can migrate 500 miles across the Gulf of Mexico overnight. Arctic terns fly between the Arctic and Antarctic each year, potentially racking up more than 1.5 million miles over a lifetime. The bar-tailed godwit can travel 7,000 miles in eight days, without stopping. On World Migratory Bird Day, we can help our feathered friends by protecting their habitats and taking simple steps like leaving less lights on at night, leaving out birdseed, and making windows more visible to avoid collisions.

It was first celebrated in the US in 1908 and was made a national holiday six years later in 1914, thanks to campaign efforts by social activist Anna Jarvis. While Jarvis became known as the founder of Mother's Day in the US, she later complained that it had become too commercial and began to vocally oppose it.

> It's American Wetlands Month, a time to celebrate swamps, marshes, bogs, and other types of these important ecosystems. Wetlands play a vital role in storing carbon, improving water quality, and serving as habitat for many endangered plants and animals, including American crocodiles and whooping cranes. And yet, wetlands are threatened. Over the centuries, they have been drained to provide land for farming, industry, and housing. Pollution and invasive plants pose further threats. Since the late 1700s, more than half of the 221 million acres of wetlands that once existed in the 48 contiguous states have disappeared.

> Georgia's Okefenokee Swamp, seen here, is a thriving wetland that is home to dozens of bird species, American alligators. and other critters. It is also the largest blackwater swamp in North America—the water appears almost black due to tannins from decaying vegetation. All looks calm in our homepage image, but the swamp gets its name from a Native American word that is often translated as 'trembling earth' or 'bubbling water.'

<summary>Description</summary>

> California brown pelicans, cormorants, and gulls enjoy jostling for position on top of this stunning rock formation in Natural Bridges State Beach in Santa Cruz. It is the sole surviving natural 'bridge' in this state park. Once three bridges stood side-by-side here, carved by waves into cliffs that jutted out into the Pacific. This one stood in the middle, but the outermost bridge collapsed in 1905 and the innermost one disappeared in 1980.
> 
> The erosion of the waves is relentless, so eventually the final arch will collapse, and the birds will have to find another favorite perch. But there are plenty of other views on offer. The park is also a seasonal home to migratory monarch butterflies, which flutter through the air or cluster together in its eucalyptus grove. And if you're lucky, you might spot a migrating whale or see seals and otters playing offshore.
