> This stunning structure is the stone pavilion housing the massive Korean Bell of Friendship in Los Angeles, a city with a large Korean American population. It's ringing in Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month, which starts today. The month was chosen in recognition of the first documented arrival of Japanese immigrants, on May 7, 1843, and the completion of the transcontinental railroad by more than 20,000 Asian immigrants on May 10, 1869.
> 
> Back to that intricately decorated bronze bell. It was a gift to the city from South Korea to mark the US bicentennial in 1976 and is modeled on the largest bell cast in Korean history, the Divine Bell of King Seongdeok, made in 771. Both versions are among the largest bells in the world.

> Today we're exploring a place of otherworldly beauty: the Jöriseen, a group of alpine lakes near Davos, Switzerland. On sunny days, the lakes glow an ethereal blue, contrasting with the dark, jagged Silvretta Alps that encircle them. The sunlight is reflected in the water by 'rock flour'—silt-sized rock particles generated from the grinding of bedrock by glaciers.
> 
> The Silvretta Alps sit across the Swiss-Austrian border and are themselves surrounded by glaciers in an area known as the 'Blue Silvretta.' If you want to enjoy these stunning views up close, you'll have to work for it. Bring your best hiking boots, plenty of water, and some strong legs.

> Welcome to Kenya's Maasai Mara National Reserve, where some of its most iconic inhabitants are out for an evening stroll. Wildebeests, also known as gnus, are social animals which often form large herds. There are two types: black wildebeests and blue wildebeests and it is the latter which take part in the famous Great Migration, one of the world's greatest wildlife spectacles.
> 
> This typically starts in January or February and sees more than a million wildebeests, along with large herds of zebras and other species, migrate from the Serengeti in neighboring Tanzania to the Maasai Mara in search of water and greener pastures. They arrive in Kenya from late July and stay until November when they start moving south again, a round trip of some 500 miles. Tourists flock to the Maasai Mara to witness this incredible natural spectacle.

> 在墨西哥，这一天被称为“普埃布拉战役日”，因为当时的墨西哥总统贝尼托·巴勃罗·胡亚雷斯·加尔卡 (Benito Pablo Juárez Garca) 于 1862 年宣布这一节日为国定假日。今天，普埃布拉人民通过游行、演讲和战斗重演来庆祝。图中的 普埃布拉天主堂又称济世圣母教堂(Nuestra Señora de los Remedios )在普埃布拉战役爆发时已经有将近 300 年的历史。

<summary>Description</summary>

> Peeking out above the trees in the Făgăraș Mountains of Romania is Poenari Castle, a fortress steeped in history and legend. In the 15th century, this castle was occupied by the notorious ruler Vlad III, aka Vlad the Impaler, aka Vlad Dracula.
> 
> Vlad wasn't a vampire, but he had a reputation for cruelty towards his enemies. His bloody resistance to Ottoman encroachment made him a national hero and the subject of much folklore—some of it gruesome. These tales are likely what inspired author Bram Stoker to name his fictional vampire Count Dracula.
> 
> Poenari Castle was abandoned decades after Vlad's death in 1476. Over the centuries, it fell into ruin as earthquakes and landslides sent parts of the building down the cliff and into the Argeș River below. Visiting the ruins today requires a bit of stamina. It's a 1,480-step climb to the citadel walls, unless you can change into a bat and fly to the top.

Squeezed into a small Norwegian fishing village, it's fair to say that Henningsvær Stadion's grounds will probably never host a UEFA Champions League.

Those who play here do so surrounded by the sound of waves, seabirds, and the smells of salt air and cod, drying on the racks surrounding the pitch.

> These stunning wild lupines bring shades of blue, pink, and purple to meadows and roadsides from early spring. They are not just a stunning addition to the landscape—they are crucial for the survival of the rare Karner blue butterfly. The larvae of the short-lived species will only feed on wild blue lupines, crawling up their stems to eat new leaves when they hatch. Once widespread across much of eastern North America, wild lupines have been in decline since the Industrial Revolution and human development has reduced their range. This has had a knock-on effect on the butterflies, which are now an endangered species. Conservation efforts have focused on replanting areas of wild blue lupines to boost butterfly numbers.

> The migration of birds, such as the pelicans seen here over California's Salton Sea, is part of the pulse of our planet's ecosystem. Around 40% of bird species migrate, typically in the fall and spring, some traveling incredible distances. Tiny hummingbirds can migrate 500 miles across the Gulf of Mexico overnight. Arctic terns fly between the Arctic and Antarctic each year, potentially racking up more than 1.5 million miles over a lifetime. The bar-tailed godwit can travel 7,000 miles in eight days, without stopping. On World Migratory Bird Day, we can help our feathered friends by protecting their habitats and taking simple steps like leaving less lights on at night, leaving out birdseed, and making windows more visible to avoid collisions.

It was first celebrated in the US in 1908 and was made a national holiday six years later in 1914, thanks to campaign efforts by social activist Anna Jarvis. While Jarvis became known as the founder of Mother's Day in the US, she later complained that it had become too commercial and began to vocally oppose it.

Wetlands play a vital role in storing carbon, improving water quality, and serving as habitat for many endangered plants and animals, including American crocodiles and whooping cranes. And yet, wetlands are threatened. Over the centuries, they have been drained to provide land for farming, industry, and housing. Pollution and invasive plants pose further threats. Since the late 1700s, more than half of the 221 million acres of wetlands that once existed in the 48 contiguous states have disappeared.

> Georgia's Okefenokee Swamp, seen here, is a thriving wetland that is home to dozens of bird species, American alligators. and other critters. It is also the largest blackwater swamp in North America—the water appears almost black due to tannins from decaying vegetation. All looks calm in our homepage image, but the swamp gets its name from a Native American word that is often translated as 'trembling earth' or 'bubbling water.'

> California brown pelicans, cormorants, and gulls enjoy jostling for position on top of this stunning rock formation in Natural Bridges State Beach in Santa Cruz. It is the sole surviving natural 'bridge' in this state park. Once three bridges stood side-by-side here, carved by waves into cliffs that jutted out into the Pacific. This one stood in the middle, but the outermost bridge collapsed in 1905 and the innermost one disappeared in 1980.
> 
> The erosion of the waves is relentless, so eventually the final arch will collapse, and the birds will have to find another favorite perch. But there are plenty of other views on offer. The park is also a seasonal home to migratory monarch butterflies, which flutter through the air or cluster together in its eucalyptus grove. And if you're lucky, you might spot a migrating whale or see seals and otters playing offshore.

> 随着自然栖息地的减少和消失，成千上万的物种面临着灭绝的危险，图中的苏门答腊犀牛亦是如此。伐木业和狩猎业使得它们生存受到威胁，被列为国际自然保护联盟濒危物种红色名录的极危物种。苏门答腊犀牛曾经遍布东南亚，现今其野生数量仅不到100只。
> 
> 虽然濒危物种日主要着眼于濒危动物，但这一天也是庆祝保护工作取得成功的日子。政府法规和组织举措的帮助让曾经濒临灭绝的物种得以繁衍。座头鲸、灰狼、老虎和秃鹰的种群数量都有显著增加。虽然已经取得了值得鼓励的进步，但我们仍须通过建立法规、增加保护、宣传引导和自我监督来继续努力。

> Sumatran rhinos like this one were once plentiful across the forests and swamps of Southeast Asia. But there are thought to be fewer than 80 alive today, surviving only on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Borneo. Logging and hunting have led to their inclusion on the ‘red list’ of more than 42,100 critically endangered species. This one is pictured in Way Kambas National Park, Sumatra, where a rhino sanctuary is home to a tiny population and is the center of a breeding and research program.

> Endangered Species Day highlights the thousands of animals and plants under threat of extinction, as well as conservation success stories. Humpback whales, gray wolves, tigers, and bald eagles have all seen population increases, thanks to conservation efforts. It’s now 50 years since the US passed the Endangered Species Act, a powerful wildlife conservation law. But while it is said to have saved 99 percent of species it protects, the challenges remain — habitat loss, invasive species, and climate change are among ongoing threats. The work continues to bring more animals and plants back from the brink.

> As flowers start to bloom, you'll hear the soft hum of bees buzzing between them, drinking nectar, and gathering pollen to take back to their hives. Some pollen grains on their bodies get carried between flowering plants, helping them to reproduce, yield better crops, and support other species. The UN proclaimed May 20 as World Bee Day to highlight the importance of these pollinators and the threats they face, including habitat loss, climate change, and pesticide use. Busy bees attend to over 90% of the world’s top 107 crops and are vital to our food supply, but populations worldwide have declined. So today, let's support our industrious friends to help them go about their important work in peace.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> Welcome to Paris, France’s ancient capital city, through which flows one of the country’s longest rivers, the Seine. Human habitation here dates back to at least the 3rd century BCE, when a Gallic tribe called the Parisii settled on an island in the middle of the river. Today, that island is known as the Île de la Cité, seen on the left of our photo, and is home to Notre-Dame cathedral, as well as other striking buildings such as the medieval Conciergerie, pictured here.
> 
> It is linked to the Place de l'Hôtel-de-Ville by the Pont d’Arcole, one of 37 bridges connecting the city’s left and right banks. The Pont d’Arcole was built in the 1850s and holds a special place in Parisiennes’ hearts. In 1944, it supported General Jacques-Philippe Leclerc's tanks on their way to liberate Paris.

<summary>Description</summary>

> It’s International Day for Biological Diversity, a day to celebrate the variety of life on Earth in all its forms, from bacteria, plants, and animals to entire ecosystems like coral reefs and rainforests. All living things within each ecosystem are interconnected, and we rely on healthy ecosystems for our water, food, medicines, clothes, energy, and shelter. But many species are threatened with extinction and ecosystems are being destroyed, which mean Earth’s rich biodiversity is in decline.
> 
> Our homepage image shows Costa Rica’s Monteverde Cloud Forest, home to about half of all species in the country, including more than 2,500 types of plants and 400 bird species. Here you’ll find jaguars and pumas living alongside sloths, howler monkeys, and the endangered resplendent quetzal. This forest alone represents about 2.5% of the world’s biodiversity, the perfect ambassador for today’s event, which calls on us to rethink our relationship with nature and work to be better stewards of the Earth.

<summary>Description</summary>

> With distinctive markings on their shells, western box turtles, such as the one seen here, are among the most widely recognized turtle species and one of two box turtle species in the US. Box turtles are named after their dome-shaped shells which are hinged at the bottom, allowing the shell to close like a box if it needs to hide from predators. They generally live for around 25 years but can survive for more than 50, and there have been reports of some living for 100 years.
> 
> Some turtles may have existed more than 100 million years ago but while they outlived the dinosaurs, more than half of all turtle and tortoise species are now on the verge of extinction. Today is World Turtle Day, an event set up to celebrate these incredible creatures and highlight their disappearing habitats.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

> This imposing structure is the Old Fortress on the Greek island of Corfu, off the western coasts of Greece and Albania. Situated in a strategic location between the Ionian and Adriatic seas, Corfu became one of the most fortified places in Europe amid successive sieges by the Ottoman Empire. The island was ruled by the Republic of Venice for 400 years until the late 18th century, which built forts in Corfu's Old Town to defend its maritime trading interests. They held off three Ottoman sieges in 1537, 1571, and 1716 but have been repaired, rebuilt, and added to over the centuries. The Old Fortress has witnessed the rise and fall of mighty empires for hundreds of years, from the tip of a rocky peninsula jutting into the sea. These days, however, it is home to the public library and Corfu's archives.
