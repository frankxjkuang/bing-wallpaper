> This stunning structure is the stone pavilion housing the massive Korean Bell of Friendship in Los Angeles, a city with a large Korean American population. It's ringing in Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month, which starts today. The month was chosen in recognition of the first documented arrival of Japanese immigrants, on May 7, 1843, and the completion of the transcontinental railroad by more than 20,000 Asian immigrants on May 10, 1869.
> 
> Back to that intricately decorated bronze bell. It was a gift to the city from South Korea to mark the US bicentennial in 1976 and is modeled on the largest bell cast in Korean history, the Divine Bell of King Seongdeok, made in 771. Both versions are among the largest bells in the world.

> Today we're exploring a place of otherworldly beauty: the Jöriseen, a group of alpine lakes near Davos, Switzerland. On sunny days, the lakes glow an ethereal blue, contrasting with the dark, jagged Silvretta Alps that encircle them. The sunlight is reflected in the water by 'rock flour'—silt-sized rock particles generated from the grinding of bedrock by glaciers.
> 
> The Silvretta Alps sit across the Swiss-Austrian border and are themselves surrounded by glaciers in an area known as the 'Blue Silvretta.' If you want to enjoy these stunning views up close, you'll have to work for it. Bring your best hiking boots, plenty of water, and some strong legs.

> Welcome to Kenya's Maasai Mara National Reserve, where some of its most iconic inhabitants are out for an evening stroll. Wildebeests, also known as gnus, are social animals which often form large herds. There are two types: black wildebeests and blue wildebeests and it is the latter which take part in the famous Great Migration, one of the world's greatest wildlife spectacles.
> 
> This typically starts in January or February and sees more than a million wildebeests, along with large herds of zebras and other species, migrate from the Serengeti in neighboring Tanzania to the Maasai Mara in search of water and greener pastures. They arrive in Kenya from late July and stay until November when they start moving south again, a round trip of some 500 miles. Tourists flock to the Maasai Mara to witness this incredible natural spectacle.

> 与许多人的看法相反，5月5日并不是墨西哥的独立日。 真正的墨西哥独立日是在每年的9月16日庆祝。 而5月5日是为了庆祝在1862年的这一天墨西哥在普埃布拉战役中战胜法兰西帝国。虽然这一天是为了纪念一个重大的历史事件，但墨西哥的庆祝活动相对平静，主要集中在普埃布拉。
> 
> 在墨西哥，这一天被称为“普埃布拉战役日”，因为当时的墨西哥总统贝尼托·巴勃罗·胡亚雷斯·加尔卡 (Benito Pablo Juárez Garca) 于 1862 年宣布这一节日为国定假日。今天，普埃布拉人民通过游行、演讲和战斗重演来庆祝。图中的 普埃布拉天主堂又称济世圣母教堂(Nuestra Señora de los Remedios )在普埃布拉战役爆发时已经有将近 300 年的历史。

> Vast colonies of royal azaleas paint the sides of South Korea’s Hwangmaesan Mountain a vibrant purple as summer approaches. Sightseers flock to see this striking pink and purple carpet of flowers which was created gradually as dairy cows and sheep ate the grass and plants, but left behind the poisonous azaleas which spread across the mountain.
> 
> For those who want to climb it, Hwangmaesan also features massive rock formations, stunning views, and a legend that anyone who prays at the summit will have their wish granted. It reaches an altitude of around 3,650 feet and offers a peaceful escape from city life for hikers and campers. Those who want to walk among the azaleas should head there in May, when they come into bloom. But dress appropriately, it still gets chilly up at the summit.

> Everyone loves a good giggle, but did you know that laughter is also good for you? Today is World Laughter Day, which highlights the healing benefits of laughing, both physically and emotionally. Some studies have shown that laughing can boost the immune system, elevate mood, and reduce pain. It turns out the old adage is true—laughter really is the best medicine.

> Whether the gray seal pup in our homepage image has heard something funny, or is just yawning in the waters off England's southwest coast is debatable. But we think you'll agree, it makes a good mascot for World Laughter Day.
