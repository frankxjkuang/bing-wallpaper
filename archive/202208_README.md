> At 8 miles in circumference, the Chittorgarh Fort is one of the largest forts in India, a nation with scores of ancient and medieval fortresses. For starters there are seven massive gates from which to enter. Inside you'll find four palaces and 19 temples. At one time there were almost 100 bodies of water, most of them ponds fed by natural catchment and rainfall, although now there are only 20. Chittorgarh ('garh' means 'fort,' so it's also known as Chittor Fort) is so old, no one is sure exactly when it was built, although reports of its earliest capture go back to the 8th century. It is one of six large forts in the northwestern state of Rajasthan referred to as the Hill Forts of Rajasthan, all of them collectively designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. We're featuring this important and ancient complex on India's 75th Independence Day, one of India's three national holidays.
> 
> On August 15, 1947, India officially broke free of Great Britain and became a sovereign and democratic nation with the speedy passage of the Indian Independence Act. The paperwork might have been fast, but the struggle for independence from British rule lasted 90 years and cost many Indian lives. The British controlled the Indian subcontinent for nearly 200 years, after winning the decisive Battle of Plassey in 1757. The victory allowed the English East India Company to eventually exercise control over most of the rest of the Indian subcontinent, Burma, and Afghanistan. East India remained the supreme authority in India for a century until 1857 when a massive rebellion by civilians and Indian soldiers against the company was suppressed, resulting in direct British rule, referred to as the British raj.
> 
> The ensuing decades saw the formation of the Indian National Congress, the rise of Indian nationalism, various armed rebellions, and many acts of civil disobedience led by Mahatma Gandhi and others, before independence was finally achieved. While India as we know it is still a very young nation, the Chittor Fort reminds us the land and people that created modern India have endured and thrived for millennia.

> To really get the feel for today's photo, stop what you're doing, put your hands in the air, and imagine yourself plunging downhill at 50 miles an hour. Screaming is optional. It's National Roller Coaster Day and we're waiting in line at Morey's Piers in Wildwood, New Jersey, for our ride on the Great White. A hybrid wooden and steel coaster, it's been in operation since 1996 and reaches its highest point 110 feet above the ground. Coaster enthusiasts point out the ride's dip under the pier shortly after the start as one of its highlights. It's also noted for a portion of the ride swinging out over the nearby beach.

> Roller coasters have come a long way since their early days beginning in the 17th century as Russian sled rides. Eventually called Russian Mountains, those original rides were just tall, wooden ramps covered in ice. When the concept made its way to the much warmer France, the sleds rolled across the tracks on wooden rollers, hence the name 'roller coaster.' Coasters saw another advancement in the 1870s when a Pennsylvania mining company built a downhill gravity railroad to transport coal. Its train cars held double duty by giving thrill rides to tourists during down time.
> 
> By the 1920s, coasters had entered their 'golden age.' New construction techniques allowed designers to build them taller, longer, and faster, drawing crowds to newly opened amusement parks around the world. These days, the United States alone has about 760 roller coasters, and thrill seekers take them on roughly 1.7 billion rides per year. Aieeeeee!

> 把你的鼻子捂严实了，今天是盐腌鲱鱼日！我们将在瑞典开封今年的盐腌鲱鱼，享用这些神奇的腐烂食物。盐腌鲱鱼是用4月和5月捕获的波罗的海鲱鱼，加少量盐腌制发酵而成。从20世纪40年代开始，一项皇家法令就禁止在8月的第三个星期四之前出售盐腌鲱鱼，以防止未完全发酵的鱼被出售。现在，瑞典已没有了这项法令，但这个规矩已经成了当地传统。
> 
> 瑞典人沉迷于装在烟熏罐头里的盐腌鲱鱼。他们坚持应该在室外打开这种罐头，最好是在水下打开，这样可以减轻“世界最臭食物”的恶臭。你可能已经看过那些流行的挑战视频，视频中人们尝试打开盐腌鲱鱼罐头尝一尝，最终惨遭失败。这正是其中的乐趣，虽然这些视频并没有真正展示出盐腌鲱鱼的风味。
> 
> 今天的照片是哥德堡群岛北部的一个小渔村。此时，那里的人们可能正在享用加了盐腌鲱鱼的瑞典薄饼。他们通常还会再加上红洋葱、酸奶油和莳萝，佐以一杯酒、啤酒甚至是牛奶。据说，这样吃起来味道非常刺激，风味极佳，带着酸味。当然，前提是你能咽得下去。一位美食评论家曾有句名言：“吃盐腌鲱鱼最大的挑战不是在吃之前吐，而是吃了第一口之后才吐。
