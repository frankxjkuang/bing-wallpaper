> November is National Native American Heritage Month, a commemoration that invites us to delve into Native peoples' traditions, languages, and art forms. There are millions of Native Americans across the US, with hundreds of tribes and groups, each with their own culture. In Arizona, Canyon de Chelly National Monument preserves the ruins of Indigenous tribes that have lived here over the past 5,000 years, including Ancestral Puebloans, who built the ancient village in our homepage image, and the Navajo, who arrived here around 1700. Carved by the relentless forces of nature, the canyon is owned by the Navajo people who manage it in cooperation with the National Park Service. Some Navajo families still live here, keeping traditions alive in one of North America's longest continuously inhabited landscapes.

> Stretching for miles below the desert sun, the salt flats of Badwater Basin shine in Death Valley National Park, California. This sweltering spot is the lowest point of elevation in North America, 282 feet below sea level. In this otherworldly landscape, the hardened mineral surface glistens like a mirror as the scorching heat dances upon it, creating rippling waves in the air. Composed of sodium chloride, borax, and other minerals, the flats' brittle crust conceals a treacherous mud layer beneath. For those who venture beyond the flats and up a mountainside, Dante's View reveals a panoramic view of Badwater Basin from a height of nearly 5,500 feet. With its surreal landscapes, Death Valley National Park serves up unique beauty in the harshest of conditions.

> Drifting along our shores and into our calendar, it's World Jellyfish Day! Jellyfish can be found in all the world's oceans, in all shapes and sizes. There are about 2,000 species, all lacking hearts, bones, and brains. Pacific sea nettle jellyfish, seen here, have vibrant golden-brown coloring and long tentacles and inhabit the coastal waters of California and Oregon. Moon jellyfish are pale with short tentacles, and, in an appropriate twist, went into orbit aboard the space shuttle Columbia in 1991, to help scientists study their unique biology. Jellyfish play a vital role in the ocean's food chain, as the main food source for many animals, including sea turtles. Their numbers are impacted by climate change, marine pollution, and overfishing, and in turn have reverberating effects on sea life around them.

> When temperatures plunge, the American bison couldn't care less. These burly mammals are ready for snow with their shaggy coats and massive bodies weighing up to 2,000 pounds. Our homepage bison are pictured in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, home to one of the largest and oldest herds in the country. Bison have roamed here since prehistoric times.
> 
> Wildlife conservationists, Native American tribes, and ranchers have campaigned to establish National Bison Day a federally recognized holiday on the first Saturday in November. In 2016, President Barack Obama signed a law making the American bison as the national mammal of the United States. The US has come a long way in the protection of this grand animal, which was on the verge of extinction just over a century ago. The establishment of the American Bison Society in 1905, of which President Theodore Roosevelt was a founder, helped spearhead conservation efforts and bring these giants back from the brink.

> Spain's Asturias region, known for its greenery, artistic legacy, and excellent food, has many hidden gems. Our homepage image shows Playa del Silencio, or Beach of Silence, a shell-shaped cove with a natural rock amphitheater. Far away from urban areas and noisy crowds, the beach enjoys a sense of isolation and solitude. Rugged cliffs surround golden sands perfect for soaking up its peaceful vibes, while nearby caves and water activities provide exciting adventures for those who crave them.
> 
> The rocky shoreline seen here is made of quartzite, formed over millions of years. This spectacular display was created when quartz grains gradually replaced the original rock while maintaining its texture. With their intricate patterns and colors, some of these rocks resemble ancient wood.

> Turquoise waters surrounded by jagged peaks and lush forests—that's Lake Pehoé for you. Nestled in Torres del Paine National Park, Chile, this glacial lake reflects the towering peaks of the Cuernos del Paine, pictured here bathed in the sun's rays. The lake gets its color from finely ground rock particles and minerals, known as glacial flour, suspended in the water. The word 'paine,' pronounced pie-neh, in the park’s name is believed to have its roots in a Tehuelche word meaning 'blue' while 'torres' means towers. The park is named after three striking granite peaks that reach up to 8,200 feet above sea level but boasts many other spectacular mountains. At 700 square miles, Torres del Paine is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve with a huge amount to offer visitors, from hiking and kayaking to stargazing. So, pack your sense of adventure and head south to beat the blues.
