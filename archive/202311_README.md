> November is National Native American Heritage Month, a commemoration that invites us to delve into Native peoples' traditions, languages, and art forms. There are millions of Native Americans across the US, with hundreds of tribes and groups, each with their own culture. In Arizona, Canyon de Chelly National Monument preserves the ruins of Indigenous tribes that have lived here over the past 5,000 years, including Ancestral Puebloans, who built the ancient village in our homepage image, and the Navajo, who arrived here around 1700. Carved by the relentless forces of nature, the canyon is owned by the Navajo people who manage it in cooperation with the National Park Service. Some Navajo families still live here, keeping traditions alive in one of North America's longest continuously inhabited landscapes.

> Stretching for miles below the desert sun, the salt flats of Badwater Basin shine in Death Valley National Park, California. This sweltering spot is the lowest point of elevation in North America, 282 feet below sea level. In this otherworldly landscape, the hardened mineral surface glistens like a mirror as the scorching heat dances upon it, creating rippling waves in the air. Composed of sodium chloride, borax, and other minerals, the flats' brittle crust conceals a treacherous mud layer beneath. For those who venture beyond the flats and up a mountainside, Dante's View reveals a panoramic view of Badwater Basin from a height of nearly 5,500 feet. With its surreal landscapes, Death Valley National Park serves up unique beauty in the harshest of conditions.

> Drifting along our shores and into our calendar, it's World Jellyfish Day! Jellyfish can be found in all the world's oceans, in all shapes and sizes. There are about 2,000 species, all lacking hearts, bones, and brains. Pacific sea nettle jellyfish, seen here, have vibrant golden-brown coloring and long tentacles and inhabit the coastal waters of California and Oregon. Moon jellyfish are pale with short tentacles, and, in an appropriate twist, went into orbit aboard the space shuttle Columbia in 1991, to help scientists study their unique biology. Jellyfish play a vital role in the ocean's food chain, as the main food source for many animals, including sea turtles. Their numbers are impacted by climate change, marine pollution, and overfishing, and in turn have reverberating effects on sea life around them.

In 2016, President Barack Obama signed a law making the American bison as the national mammal of the United States. The US has come a long way in the protection of this grand animal, which was on the verge of extinction just over a century ago. The establishment of the American Bison Society in 1905, of which President Theodore Roosevelt was a founder, helped spearhead conservation efforts and bring these giants back from the brink.

> Turquoise waters surrounded by jagged peaks and lush forests—that's Lake Pehoé for you. Nestled in Torres del Paine National Park, Chile, this glacial lake reflects the towering peaks of the Cuernos del Paine, pictured here bathed in the sun's rays. The lake gets its color from finely ground rock particles and minerals, known as glacial flour, suspended in the water. The word 'paine,' pronounced pie-neh, in the park’s name is believed to have its roots in a Tehuelche word meaning 'blue' while 'torres' means towers. The park is named after three striking granite peaks that reach up to 8,200 feet above sea level but boasts many other spectacular mountains. At 700 square miles, Torres del Paine is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve with a huge amount to offer visitors, from hiking and kayaking to stargazing. So, pack your sense of adventure and head south to beat the blues.

Beneath the multicolored surface lies the land's history, including the remains of ancient horses, camels, tigers, and rhinos. The barren landscape, dotted with pinnacles and prairies, was formed by two geological processes: deposition, where the layered rocks were gradually stacked up on top of each other by inland seas, winds, and rivers over millions of years, and erosion, which began about 500,000 years ago. The Red Shirt Table, at 3,340 feet, is the highest point in the park, which was established on this day in 1978. It protects 379 square miles of rocky buttes, pinnacles, and prairies. This inhospitable terrain was called 'Mako Sica,' or 'land bad' by the Oglala Lakota people, who have lived here for hundreds of years. Still thirsty for knowledge? Visit the national park's museum collection. There are over 360,000 objects that have a lot more to reveal!

> 自古以来，鸟类的形象就存在于人类文化的民间传说和神话中。最著名的例子是神话中的凤凰，它最早出现在古埃及，被视为重生的象征。在俄罗斯神话中有火鸟，在希腊神话有鹰身女妖“哈比”。在德国民间传说中也有许多神话生物，它们或为鸟，或为鸟类与其他动物组成的神兽。一个具体的例子是Elwetritsch，这是一种主要出现在德国西南部文化中的鸟类形象。

The name 'Diwali' comes from the Sanskrit term 'Dipavali,' which means 'row of lights,' and the heart of the festival lies in the oil lamps, or 'diyas,' which illuminate homes and public spaces. They create a dazzling spectacle symbolizing the triumph of knowledge over ignorance and good over evil. The city of Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh, India, pictured in today's image, hosts one of the world's largest displays of oil lamps. Hundreds of thousands of diyas are lit on the banks of the Sarayu River during Diwali.
